And in another sent last May, Kadzik\\\\\\'s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \\\\n\\\\nâ\\\\x80¢ Kadzik lobbied Podesta ( then WH Chief of Staff ) to pardon his billionaire, tax dodger fugitive client Marc Rich, whose wife gave $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. FBI Director James Comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and Hillary Clinton put all over the face of FBI agency. By reopening Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s case, thanks to 650k-emails linked to sex scandal of Huma Abedin\\\\\\'s husband Anthony Weiner and the mutiny of FBI agents who won\\\\\\'t put up with Comey\\\\\\'s crap, we are suppose to finally get justice. \\\\n\\\\nBut guess what? DOJ assigned a Clinton ally and John Podesta\\\\\\'s very close friend Peter Kadzik to take charge of the new investigation. \\\\n\\\\nIn a letter to Congress, the DOJ writes that it \"will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,\" assistant attorney General Peter J. Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. \\\\n\\\\nWHO IS PETER KADZIK? \\\\n\\\\nAccording to an excellent article published by DAILY CALLER: \\\\n\\\\nThe day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat\\\\\\'s campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. \\\\n\\\\nThe dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state\\\\\\'s email practices. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPodesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta\\\\\\'s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik\\\\\\'s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \\\\n\\\\nThe post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. \\\\n\\\\nKadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. \\\\n\\\\nIn the trenches \\\\n\\\\nPodesta and Kadzik have a long history â\\\\x80\\\\x94 one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. \\\\n\\\\nKadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. \\\\n\\\\nThat history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. \\\\n\\\\nIn a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. \\\\n\\\\nPodesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a \"fantastic lawyer\" who \"kept me out of jail.\" \\\\n\\\\nPodesta had been promoted to Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. \\\\n\\\\nKadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. \\\\n\\\\nTo help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. \\\\n\\\\nA House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that \"Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich\\\\\\'s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.\" \\\\n\\\\nThe report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Richâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s pardon. \\\\n\\\\nOn top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich\\\\\\'s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library.\\\\n\\\\nSOMETHING STINKS (again)! Peter J.

Cast member Brandon Dixon stopped Pence on his way out of the performance to publicly shame him in front of the audience and cast members of Hamilton. Dixonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s message was written by show creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, director, Thomas Kail and lead producer, Jeffrey Seller, according to the New York Times. â\\\\x80\\\\x98We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us,â\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dixon said, reading the message aloud. But cast members were able to give input. RadarOnline investigated whether or not the actors had voted and revealed many leads hadnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t in years. Dixonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s records show he didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t vote during president Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s reelection bid in 2012. Javier Munoz, playing the titular role of Hamilton, registered to vote in 2006 and voted in the mid-term elections, but hasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t been on record as voting since. \\\\nSeth Stewart, who plays Thomas Jefferson, voted in 2008 when Obama ran for the first time. He did not vote in 2012. Okieriete â\\\\x80\\\\x9cOakâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Onaodowan, who players James Madison and Hercules Mulligan, registered to vote in 2005 but hasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t been on record voting since. Since the clash with the Hamilton cast, Pence told Fox News he wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t offended by the message and said the booing â\\\\x80\\\\x98is what freedom sounds likeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99. â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Daily Mail \\\\n\\'\\n \"14 Shares\\\\n12 0 0 2 (Taksim Square - Gezi Park Protests, Ä°stanbul. Credit: Alan Hilditch / flickr)\\\\nDemocracy grants people the right to protest, to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world. It serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies, drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters. Demonstrations, rallies, strikes, pickets, boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting. As long as they are within the limits defined by the â\\\\x80\\\\x9claw,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy, freedom of opinion and expression.\\\\nHowever, in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself. Protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments.\\\\nLegitimacy of Protests and Feasibility of Demands\\\\nDemocratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible, justified and feasible . Protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met.\\\\nThe anti-government movement in Bulgaria in 2013-14 confirmed the validity of these qualities. The protests took place in three separate cycles. January and February witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign. They were successful as the requests were sensible. A later demonstration was against a government officer, and resulted in his resignation. Yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system, along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society.\\\\nMORE... Gruesome Video Shows Turkish Soldiers Execute Female Kurdish PKK Fighters by Shooting in Their Heads 2 bombers, stopped by police, blew themselves up in Turkey Dispute over Kurds and Coup attempt threatens U.S.-Turkey alliance The attempted coup dâ\\\\x80\\\\x99Ã©tat made Turkey band together The Gezi Park protests in Turkey in the same year followed the same pattern. Set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach, it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first. The government heeded the nature loversâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of Gezi Park. Yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature. Demonstrations that began in Gezi Park in Istanbul and that demanded the preservation of Gezi Park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government. It was a quite clear coup dâ\\\\x80\\\\x99etat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government. The protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights, but then appealed to non-democratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation.\\\\nThough justified at the beginning, these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of ill-minded people. Recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countriesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments. They bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests, which then lead to violent anti-democratic clashes. These protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another. It all happens in the wake of a governmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s non-yielding to some dark powerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s demands and a democratically elected government faces anti-democratic attempts.\\\\nMethods of Provocations and OTPOR\\\\nSuch dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media. Social media becomes an instrument for organizing, stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations. Various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent. These illegal â\\\\x80\\\\x9csubcontractorsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors, academicians, journalists and members of non-governmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public.\\\\nOne of the most common groups among these â\\\\x80\\\\x9c professional revolutionary organizations â\\\\x80\\\\x9d is a Serbia-based resistance organization,OTPOR . Independent observers state that OTPOR organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the US-backed dissident organizations in many countries such as the former Yugoslavia, Serbia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Egypt, Brazil, and Turkey. There is a consensus that the CIA has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries OTPOR its offshoot CANVASâ\\\\x80¦\\\\nA relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings OTPOR :\\\\nThe (OTPOR \\'s ) fist-logo, would turn up 11 years later in the streets of Cairo , illustrating further the preposterous, foreign-backed nature of the Egyptian uprisings... Serbiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s OTPOR would continue receiving funds from the West and become a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCIA-coup collegeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of sorts under the name of CANVAS (Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies ).\\\\nThe research article penned by Carl Gibson and Steve Horn and published on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cOccupy.comâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d deals with the international financial, intelligence and political connections of OTPOR and features the following information based on WikiLeaks documents:\\\\nSerbiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Srdja Popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere since the late-1990s , and as one of the co-founders of OTPORâ\\\\x80¦ Popovic and OTPOR\\'s offshoot CANVAS have also maintained close ties with a Goldman Sachs executive and the private intelligence firm Stratfor as well as the U.S. government â\\\\x80¦\\\\nSuch examples are easy to find. The internal public opinion on OTPOR is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the U.S. No wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the US administration speak highly of OTPOR at every turn. Moreover, the British media rigorously advocates that the executives of OTPOR have nothing to do with the organization of coups.\\\\nLikewise, some Turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. The attempt to occupy the Prime Ministerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s residence by armed groups, which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law, was orchestrated by OTPOR, according to reports. Yet the media deliberately defined it as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe exercise of legitimate, democratic rights, and freedom of expression by the people,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the Marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation. These media organs called the nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peopleâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s lives as â\\\\x80\\\\x98the so-called enemies of freedom and democracy.â\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nIn truth, such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments, divide countries and organize bloody conflicts - and even civil wars - can no longer be called innocent rallies, but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within.\"\\n \\'Email HEALTHCARE REFORM TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN \\\\nSince March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Actâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Obamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. \\\\nCongress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: \\\\n1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. \\\\n2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. \\\\n3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up \\'\\n \"Found this nugget in Podesta files Fastwalkers and DSP Program page: 1 Found this in the Podesta files, ID # 30433. It\\'s probably well known already, just thought I\\'d post it just in case. Podesta had forwarded this letter he received onto Leslie Kean. Date: 2015-03-06 John â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Just tuck this in your UFO files for future reference. One of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them as the US prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization in El Segundo, CA. No one could get into the cafeteria without TS/SCI clearances, so this was not â\\\\x80\\\\x9clightweight group of gossipers.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d One of these times, a member of that group was really excited â\\\\x80\\\\x93 said theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99d just picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day). He described how it entered our atmosphere from â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdeep spaceâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (origin actually unknown, of course, but from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to earth. Not only was it going very fast but it made a 30 degree course correction (turn) which means it did not have a ballistic (free fall) reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So, it was under some sort of control â\\\\x80\\\\x93 although whether it was â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmannedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d or just â\\\\x80\\\\x9croboticâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s no way to tell. Although its now 24 years later, one factoid makes me think the USAF is still collecting information on these Fastwalkers. Reading the current official USAF â\\\\x80\\\\x9cDSP Fact Sheetâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d there is this line near the end: In addition, researchers at The Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. www.losangeles.af.mil... Also, much of the information on this site is accurate although I do not know the author or his sources: ufodigest.com... Somewhere within that USAF program office is many yearâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth of Fastwalker data. If someone were to collect and analyze it, patterns will emerge that provide information about the various types of craft and their destinations, which would add substantiation to eyewitness claims on the ground about UFO activity. Furthermore, it would be interesting to understand the dates of these appearances â\\\\x80\\\\x93 is there a certain time of the every year they swarm in (which might indicate a resource mining operation) or might there be a correlation with major events on earth, (such as the detonation of the first atomic bomb at White Sands in 1945 although no DSPâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s existed to provide any info on that particular event)?

Frompovich \\\\nThis is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3, 2016. \\\\nCurrently, Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session, which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights, especially of redress to government, and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution, I contend. \\\\nProbably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMF/RFR controversy or conundrum, if you may, from a scientific viewpoint than the 35-page report â\\\\x80\\\\x9c EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses ,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which is a Spanish language document and found online at https://listas.um.es/sympa/arc/anuncios/2016-07/msg00069.html This report cites 308 published scientific references, which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUCâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and PECO in particularâ\\\\x80\\\\x94are so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era â\\\\x80\\\\x98safetyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in â\\\\x80\\\\x98ancientâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of â\\\\x80\\\\x98safetyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99. \\\\nThose â\\\\x80\\\\x98safetyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 studies originated in Germany during World War II; are totally outmoded; but remain the present Federal Communications Commissionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters. It is now 2016! How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the â\\\\x80\\\\x98gold standardâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 or â\\\\x80\\\\x98scientific criterionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things? Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in todayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s technology world of 2016. Whereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the science later than the 1940s? Please, may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC? \\\\nFrompovich, therefore, respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the above-aforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals, who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed, in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFR/EMF health-damaging electromagnetics, plus their fire-and-explosion-prone proclivities and occurrences, which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters. \\\\nChildren are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and, therefore, I introduce Exhibit U-1 â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy children absorb more microwave radiation than adults: The Consequences,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and Exhibit U-2 â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmerican Academy of Pediatrics August 29, 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates (SARs) regarding EMF/RF exposures.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAlso, I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity (EHS) is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY, Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following: 26% of the USA population; 19% of the Swedish population; 27% of the Danish population; and 32 % of the German population are EHS compromised. See Exhibit V . However, other sources claim that as much as 5% of the entire worldâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s population is affected. \\\\nJust as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94now referred to as â\\\\x80\\\\x9csick building syndromeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d or â\\\\x80\\\\x9cMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)â\\\\x80\\\\x94so, too, is EHS now being recognized by many, including the World Health Organization. I introduce Exhibit W â\\\\x80\\\\x9cElectrohypersensitivity: a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Printout available here https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI \\\\nAs Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cA review on Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and the reproductive system,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which outlines science the microwave industry, PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters, plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 24/7/365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters. \\\\nBefore I include my previously submitted testimony, I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not, since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections, which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by. \\\\nFurthermore, it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies â\\\\x80\\\\x93 but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commissionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s stated mission for being â\\\\x80\\\\x93 to provide safe and non-radiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100% certainty, which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels, especially with their proclivity for â\\\\x80\\\\x9chot sockets,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d fires and explosions, EMF/RF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day! \\\\nNo medical-scientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding non-thermal adverse health effects that I know of. Whereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the science? \\\\nTherefore, Frompovich should not be forced to allow a proven-fire-prone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds. \\\\nJust to add more â\\\\x80\\\\x9csalt to the wound,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d as they would say, there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things, or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesâ\\\\x80\\\\x94for whatever reasonsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO, the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents. \\\\nTherefore, Frompovich feels her privacy, as well as her home and personal physiology, will be subjected to unlawful, unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and, specifically, without proper legal processes, e.g., court-issued warrants, in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the two-way ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all â\\\\x80\\\\x9csmartâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things. The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no oneâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s business but her own. \\\\nIâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively , including technologies, since the late 1970s. During my career, I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several statesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 legislature/legislative hearings on health issues. For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet, nutrition, epigenetics, and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health, avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles. \\\\nI am in my 78 th year, thank God. Since the early 1970s, when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life, Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been immersed in whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cholistic lifestyle.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve beaten the odds, including being a breast cancer survivor, using holistic healthcare modalities. For the record, 38.3% of U.S. adults and 11.8% of U.S. children used whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics[1]. Complementary and Alternative Medicineâ\\\\x80\\\\x94CAM as itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s called, is popular throughout the world, while in the U.S. there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health. \\\\nHowever, the allopathic paradigm considers it, quite frankly, a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgo toâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d healthcare system when allopathy fails one. \\\\nTherefore, I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers, Wi-Fi, â\\\\x80\\\\x98smartâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 gadgets, and, in particular, AMI Smart Meters, which are being bully-forced onto electric, natural gas, and municipal water utility customers. Most state legislators, the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health. Fortunately, I am not one of those people, thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house. But, first I think you ought to know some of my background: Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m a well-informed, plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher, advocate-activist, journalist, and author. \\\\nThat I should be taken seriously, I offer some of my professional background: retired practicing natural nutritionist; former registered lobbyist with the U.S. Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues; executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare (CANAH) for five years and, as such, presented FDA-solicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTA-H-405 NTIS #PB91-104893[2] â\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnconventional Cancer Treatmentsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d [3]; expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation; government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation, who set up LEFâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s government relations department; a published journalist; author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazon.com and my 2016 book, Eat to Beat Disease, Foods Medicinal Qualities. \\\\nAdditionally, I wrote and produced two TV shows. One called, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Turn Off the Violence â\\\\x80\\\\x9d was nominated for a Telly Award. That hour-long show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons, who stick out their necks for the common good. The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland[4], who founded a 24-hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted on-campus non-violence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence. What Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve shared is much less than half of my background. More would take too much of your time. However, I feel compelled to ask, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nFurthermore, I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict, rather than an informed, concerned health-conscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health, I probably would be welcomed with open arms, plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help. Because I am opposing faulty and health-damaging RF/EMF â\\\\x80\\\\x98scienceâ\\\\x80\\\\x99, plus vested-interest snooping, surveillance, and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters, I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full. That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t there something radically wrong with such a construct, especially in the USA, if I have to do that? \\\\nAttorney Ward Smithâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s interrogatory requesting Frompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s cancer health records, quite frankly, leaves everyone with whom Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve shared that fact, totally aghast and amazed! Why? Because Frompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them. Furthermore, since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record, Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings, as that is her fundamental right. \\\\nI respectfully bring to this courtâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue. Whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the issue, problem, and at stake not only for me, but for all Pennsylvanians, is the total callous disregard by utility companiesâ\\\\x80\\\\x94PECO included, the PA PUC, and the Commonwealth for health hazards, safety, and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians, especially those with health issues, compromised immune systems, disabilities, and especially young, growing childrenâ\\\\x80\\\\x94fetuses in particularâ\\\\x80\\\\x94whom RF/EMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively. \\\\nBefore presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94not 1940s vintage radar safety researchâ\\\\x80\\\\x94for RFs/EMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health, I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum , and that is, healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from non-ionizing radiation RFs/EMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue. \\\\nThere are mounting underlying, long-term adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUC-PECO forced AMI Smart Meter 24/7/365 RF/EMF electromagnetics, pulses, harmonics and dirty electricity, specifically adverse Non-thermal health effects, impacting children and an ageing PA population, which will generate dire fiscal consequences, plus responsibilities, upon Penna. Medicaid health cost line items in each yearâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s operating budget for the Commonwealth. \\\\nTo cement that forewarning, I offer the World Health Organizationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s statistic, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cApproximately 10% of reported cases of EHS [electromagnetic hypersensitivity] were considered severe,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which means specialized caregiving. That, however, does not include cancer-induced health issues from RFs/EMFs! What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PAâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s legislature and governor to haggle about, when weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s been going on recently to get a state budget passed?

The Crown reported that Pickton told the officer that he wanted to kill another woman to make it an even 50, and that he was caught because he was \"sloppy\".[9] Background[edit] \\\\n\\\\nBy 1992, Robert William Pickton and his brother David owned a Port Coquitlam farm. Worker Bill Hiscox called it a \"creepy-looking place\", noting that it was patrolled by a 600-lb. (270 kg) boar , one of the few actual pigs on the farm. \"I never saw a pig like that, who would chase you and bite at you,\" he said. \"It was running out with the dogs around the property.\" He later described Pickton as a \"pretty quiet guy, hard to strike up a conversation with,\" whose occasionally bizarre behavior, despite no evidence of substance abuse , would draw attention. \\\\n\\\\nPickton\\\\\\'s only vehicle was a converted bus, with deeply tinted windows, to which he was emotionally attached. The Pickton brothers gradually neglected the site\\\\\\'s farming operations. They registered a non-profit charity, the Piggy Palace Good Times Society, with the Canadian government in 1996 as aiming to \"organize, co-ordinate, manage and operate special events, functions, dances, shows and exhibitions on behalf of service organizations, sports organizations and other worthy groups.\" Its events included raves and wild parties featuring Vancouver prostitutes and gatherings in a converted slaughterhouse. These events attracted as many as 2,000 people.

And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau\\\\\\'s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. \\\\n\\\\nThose emails stretched back years , these people said, and were on a laptop that both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin used and that hadn\\\\\\'t previously come up in the Clinton email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating. \\\\n\\\\nThe FBI had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn\\\\\\'t give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. Clinton\\\\\\'s email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager. \\\\n\\\\nAs reported yesterday, it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of Abedin linked emails on Weiner\\\\\\'s computer: \\\\n\\\\nIn their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. Clinton\\\\\\'s home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the FBI. Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them. \\\\n\\\\nThe WSJ then connects the dots between how the Weiner emails were linked to the Clinton reopening of the Clinton probe, despite Loretta Lynch\\\\\\'s and the DOJ\\\\\\'s vocal urges not to do so : \\\\n\\\\nAt a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the departmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said. \\\\n\\\\nMr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptopâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant. \\\\n\\\\nMr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned Mr. Comey that telling Congress would violate well-established policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey\\\\\\'s repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his first press conference on the subject in July. \\\\n\\\\nBut wait it gets better. \\\\n\\\\nRecall that this is the same Andrew Mcabe whose wife the Wall Street Journal reported last week received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member. \\\\n\\\\nMr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate, giving Mr. McAuliffe more sway in the state capitol. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority. \\\\n\\\\nFBI officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the Clinton email probe until he became deputy director, and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wife\\\\\\'s campaign was over. Which brings us to the second big topic: the Clinton Foundation, and how the DOJ made sure that particular probe never made the light of day. At the same time as the Clinton server was being investigated, other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months. \\\\n\\\\nEarly this year, four FBI field officesâ\\\\x80\\\\x94New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.â\\\\x80\\\\x94were collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter. \\\\n\\\\nThe WSJ touches on something fascinating: Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said. So where did that trail go? Apparently nowhere. \\\\n\\\\nThe Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Clinton Foundation board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity. The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. \\\\n\\\\nIn February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn\\\\\\'t go well. \\\\n\\\\nSome said that is because the FBI didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn\\\\\\'t a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. \\\\n\\\\n\"That was one of the weirdest meetings I\\\\\\'ve ever been to,\" one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. \\\\n\\\\nNeedless to say, the probe into the Foundation faded. \\\\n\\\\nBut back to the Clinton probe, according to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe, despite the department\\\\\\'s refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t use those methods. \\\\n\\\\nAt this point a question emerges: did McCabe seek to defend or press on with a Clinton probe: Mr. McCabeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s defenders in the agency said that following the call, he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the Clinton Foundation investigation: Agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had. \\\\n\\\\nOthers further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cStand down.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d When agents questioned why they werenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy directorâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Mr. McCabe. Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction. \\\\n\\\\nAt this point the two probes, into Hillary\\\\\\'s email and the Clinton Foundation converged: \\\\n\\\\nFor agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadershipâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadershipâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s approach was the right response to the facts on the ground. \\\\n\\\\nThings accelerated over the past two months, when in September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information. \\\\n\\\\nSome FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they could not â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgo prosecutor-shopping.\" \\\\n\\\\nNot long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureauâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey\\\\\\'s disclosure to Congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign \\\\n\\\\nWhile much of the latest developments are known, or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government agencies, the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if Clinton wins the White House, she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by law-enforcement officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases. It also means that Trump will be hounding Hilllary for the remainder of the campaign as being the only presidential candidate to seek election with a recently reopened criminal probe hanging over her head.\" \\\\n\\\\n\" Serco Processes 2 Millionth Patent Application for U.S. Patent and Trademark  \\\\nOffice Date: 18 Mar 2013 Serco Inc., a leading provider of professional, technology, and management services to the federal government, announced today that their Pre-Grant Publication (PGPubs) Classification Services team recently processed their 2 millionth patent application for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\"Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE (born 5 July 1963 in Durban, South Africa)[1] was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 2013.[2] â\\\\x80¦ On graduation, he worked for Arthur Andersen.

Recently Chomsky, with John Halle, propounded \" An Eight Point Brief for LEV (Lesser Evil Voting) .\"\\\\nChomsky questions the ethical/moral principle rejecting LEV since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil. As futile as lesser evilism is, it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the United States. LEV, in fact, is an equally contemptible or greater evil.\\\\nChomsky, though, sensibly cautions that challenges to the political-business duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences. What are the possible consequences? Chomsky suggests, \"A Trump presidency, should it materialize, will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the Sanders campaign, particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right.\" However, another consequence is equally possible: a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist Democrat, and/or it might finally cause former or potential Democrats to reject the chicanery of the business-dominated Democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the Green Party.\\\\nThis cost/benefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change.\\\\nFocusing on the electoral system, however, must not be the end-all and be-all for bringing about progressivism in the US. Grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform, oppose poverty and impoverishment, oppose war and violence, and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people â\\\\x80\\\\x94 during electoral periods and between election cycles.\\\\nMORE... 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 9 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 7 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 3 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 2 I examine Halle and Chomsky\\\\\\'s Eight Point Brief for LEV.\\\\n1) Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites.\\\\nNo argument with this.\\\\n2) The exclusive consequence of the act of voting in 2016 will be (if in a contested \"swing state\") to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning.\\\\nThis is true of the individual act of voting. The individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result; that is an obvious given. However, when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of like-minded individuals then enormous potentials emerge. This desire for a change from the effete status quo is, arguably, what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of Bernie Saunders, and it is also what happened, in a dissimilar manner, with the candidacy of Donald Trump. Chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action, and it is. But individuals can and do, at times, form a wider consciousness, measurable by statistically rigorous polling results, that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins. An example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the Canadian federal election of 1993. Following two successive majority governments led by the Brian Mulroney Tories, a voting tsunami washed away all but two Tory seats in the 295-seat Parliament. The conservatives had been around since 1867, but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the Tories.\\\\n3) One of these candidates, Trump, denies the existence of global warming, calls for increasing use of fossil fuels, dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to India and other developing nations as called for in the Paris agreement, the combination of which could, in four years, take us to a catastrophic tipping point. Trump has also pledged to deport 11 million Mexican immigrants, offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted African American protestors at his rallies, stated his \"openness to using nuclear weapons\", supports a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and regards \"the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood\" while having \"done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order.\" Trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich, hence shredding what remains of the social welfare \"safety net\" despite pretenses.\\\\nMuch of what Trump stands for is anathema. True. There is no need to defend this man. However, Trump stakes out important positions diametrical to Hillary Clinton; for example, Clinton\\\\\\'s advocacy of a no-fly zone over Syria, her saber rattling with Russia, her corporate-friendly policy toward so-called free trade deals.\\\\nChomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection, writing:\\\\n... with respect to point 3) which some will challenge by citing the claim that Clinton\\\\\\'s foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of Trump.\\\\nIn any case, while conceding as an outside possibility that Trump\\\\\\'s foreign policy is preferable, most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement. Furthermore, insofar as this is the fact of the matter, following the logic through seems to require a vote for Trump, though it\\\\\\'s a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously.\\\\nFirst, Chomsky concedes \"an outside possibility that Trump\\\\\\'s foreign policy is preferable...\" In other words, Chomsky posits an inside possibility (one assumes that Chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood) that Clinton\\\\\\'s foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so. Second, he raises an unreasonable demand for \"evidence\" that Trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than Clinton. Given that Trump has never held political office no such evidence exists. What does exist is plenty of evidence that Clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy. There is no reason to assume Clinton would reduce the number of American military bases overseas or curtail military spending. In fact, it is likelier that she would increase military spending. She will also likeliest resort to a US military attack to bring about \"regime change\" in Syria, pushing the US closer to military confrontation with Russia. Trump\\\\\\'s detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to Clinton\\\\\\'s rhetoric. But toward Putin or Assad, Clinton\\\\\\'s undiplomatic utterances are on record.\\\\nMoreover, following Chomsky\\\\\\'s logic, while the more preferable policies of Trump lack evidence, by the same token, the more objectionable policies of Trump also lack evidence for the same reason: Trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the Oval Office. Thus, following this Chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of Trump\\\\\\'s pronouncements. Would he really build a wall on the Mexico-US border? Where is the evidence for this? Would Trump really ban Muslims from entering the US? Where is the evidence for this?\\\\nBy effectively undermining Trump\\\\\\'s peacemongering vis-Ã\\\\xa0-vis Clinton\\\\\\'s warmongering, Chomsky, by the same logic, undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by Trump. Thus, following Chomsky\\\\\\'s logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously.\\\\n4) The suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a Clinton presidency.\\\\nOne assumes that Chomsky refers to the domestic population here. Trump\\\\\\'s policies â\\\\x80\\\\x94 if he is true to his word to protect jobs for American workers and punish offshoring of American jobs along with his opposition to the TPP â\\\\x80\\\\x94 would be a political reversal for neoliberalization. Clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad. The economic plight of students, the poor, and ill, however, would be much better under a Jill Stein presidency .\\\\nThe economic plight of students, the poor, and ill would be much better under a Jill Stein presidency.\\\\nIf Chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of US foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations, then I agree with his \"basic moral principle\": \"not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves.\" Under the Democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died, millions of people have been displaced, and terrorist organizations have proliferated. This is the evidence from Clinton\\\\\\'s time in political office. Thus a vote for Clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation, perhaps even a ramping up, of the suffering of others. Basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppression-enabling vote.\\\\n5) Should constitute sufficient basis to voting for Clinton where a vote is potentially consequential-namely, in a contested, \"swing\" state.\\\\nI contend that Chomsky\\\\\\'s basis for 5) is false or questionable. First, Chomsky has staunchly argued that \"we\" should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over. But it seems that Chomsky believes that Trump will supersede Clinton\\\\\\'s record of killing in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Clinton is not going to close US military abroad. Trump has called these bases into question. And if one concentrates on the domestic population, at least the rhetoric of Trump against so-called free trade agreements and offshoring US factories abroad bodes well for the American worker.\\\\n6) However, the left should also recognize that, should Trump win based on its failure to support Clinton, it will repeatedly face the accusation (based in fact), that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a Trump administration.\\\\nThis criticism is anti-democratic; furthermore, the criticism applies conversely. Chomsky\\\\\\'s citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence. Effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the business-party duopoly. The records of the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale. Clinton deregulated the finance sector, exposed American workers to the vagaries of \"free trade,\" implemented regressive welfare policies, and continued aggressive US militarism abroad. Obama? Bailing out the banks; attempts to cut back social security; warring in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and Syria; drone strikes; confrontation with Russia and China; TPP; and the lingering incarceration at Guantanamo Bay. It is important to note that Democrats, arguably, have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than Republicans have since many supporters of Democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the Republicans. George Bush was stymied from tinkering with social security. Notably, Obama has done an about-face on social security and proposed an expansion, picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the Bernie Saunders candidacy.\\\\n7) Often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the Democratic Party or outside of it. They will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it, as they must.\\\\nIt is true that establishment operatives will use LEV as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the Democratic Party or outside of it. That was the case when Ralph Nader ran. It is the case when Cynthia McKinney ran and it is when Jill Stein runs. The corporate media and even many so-called progressives will trot out this time-worn argument with each election cycle. As long as enough people buy into the premise, then the status quo will persist. The result is that a right-wing government always assumes office in Washington. This bodes ill for the poor and working class. It bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the US.\\\\n8) Conclusion: by dismissing a \"lesser evil\" electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for Clinton\\\\\\'s defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve.\\\\nConclusion: by buying into a \"lesser evil\" electoral logic the corporate-political duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the 1% and their goals for further enrichment; to unfetter finance, to pursue a belligerent foreign policy â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a policy that seeks to placate the military-industrial establishment; and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system. All of this is at cross-hairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve.\\\\nFinal Comments\\\\nThe tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil.\\\\nSome leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism . I found that to be preposterous. Barack Obama was the so-called lesser evil the previous two election cycles. Obama is not a lesser evilist; he is the man who enables evil. ... The cycles of US-backed violence and killing in places such as Gaza, Syria, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism. If one votes for a degree of evil, then one should not be surprised when evil results.\\\\nProgressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil. Morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed. A genuine peacemongering US president is needed to stop the killing and save lives. Consequently, both Democrats and Republicans are anathema. Given the present candidates, if people vote, then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions.\\\\nOnly a propeace \"third\" party will set the US on a new path . Outside of a revolution, the election of a propeace \"third\" party is the only moral direction on the horizon for Americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined US reputation. Such a \"third party\" vote, however, may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising fronts.\\'\\n \\'10 Shares\\\\n4 5 0 1\\\\n\"USA! USA! USA!\" they chanted together in the Hilton Ballroom as the results came in. Who needs polls? They never gave him a chance but now we have it: President Donald Trump. Not only were the polls spectacularly wrong (who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel?) but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that Trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what America was thinking across its societal spectrum, what it wanted, what was felt deep in its blood.\\\\nIt is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire West has wallowed in since the 90\\\\\\'s and a rejection of Obama and the false hope he decried, the impotent nature of US political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by \"Crooked Hillary\".\\\\nThe world must live with it; democracy has spoken and they\\\\\\'re going to have to get over the words President Trump. Some will head for the hills, some will run to Canada, others will continue to cry but as Obama said yesterday, regardless of the result \"tomorrow the sun will still shine.\"\\\\nThis is a cry for American exceptionalism and like him or not Trump typifies that. He is committed to education, and demands high performance. Selling well is an admirable skill for a President to have. Negotiating with Congress, internationally, etc., is exceptionally useful. Trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose.\\\\nTrump\\\\\\'s business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world, and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates -- this gives him keen, realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world, as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements, and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors, not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships and/or antagonism between different industries and particular governments.\\\\nMORE...

What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the Left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying #NeverTrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate.\\\\nAlthough it is entirely true that Trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes, he brings something to the Presidential table no other candidate had before; he speaks his mind.\\\\nAmerica clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear, they want the facts straight.\\\\nPresident Trump isn\\\\\\'t cut from the political class, that class which is entrenched in its self-interest and has let the country down time and time again. Ross Perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables, a corrupted, ethically questionable President is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and I\\\\\\'m not talking about Donald Trump.\\\\nTrump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos, he is not a social engineer, a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts. The liberal Democratic policies of Obama, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today.\\\\nSo what if his language is intemperate and insulting? Even lacking in nobility from time to time? How can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people, uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long?\\\\nObama won because conservative voters stayed home. He had promise and he let so many down, what did Clinton have? And that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote.\\\\nTrump prefers isolationism on a world scale, Clinton voted to take us to war in Iraq and to overthrow Libya\\\\\\'s Gaddafi, all in the guise of being \"muscular.\"\\\\nPerhaps today\\\\\\'s landmark and historic decision is not so much about Trump\\\\\\'s strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in 2016 and you simply cannot blame him for that.\\'\\n \\'Michigan billionaire education activist Betsy DeVos was confirmed today to serve as the secretary of education in President Trump\\\\\\'s administration, after Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. The Senate voted on DeVos\"?highly contentious nomination this afternoon, and the tally was split evenly, requiring Pence to use his authority as president of the upper chamber of Congress to break the impasse. This was the first time that a vice president has broken a tie to confirm a Cabinet nominee. Pence read the vote count 50-50 and then voted himself, rendering the tally 51-50. The day before the vote, Democrats staged a 24-hour marathon of speeches, with more than 30 lawmakers taking to the floor to urge at least one additional Republican to vote against DeVos and block her confirmation. \"It is hard to imagine a worse choice,\"?Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said before she read letters from constituents urging her to vote no. DeVos stirred up vehement opposition from teachers\"?unions and all 48 Senate Democrats. Many cited concerns about her support of school vouchers, which critics believe will weaken public schools, and her lack of experience, since she never attended or worked in the public education system. Others cited her lack of familiarity with a landmark law protecting the education needs of disabled children.     She was panned for a gaffe during her confirmation hearing, when she hedged on an answer about guns in schools by saying they might be needed in states like Wyoming to defend against \"potential grizzlies.\"?DeVos\\\\\\' nomination drew above-average negative reactions from the public, with voters flooding Senate phone lines and email accounts in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said his office received 14,000 calls about DeVos. In addition to the entire Democratic caucus, two moderate Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced they would not support DeVos. During a speech announcing her opposition, Collins said DeVos\"?focus on charters and vouchers \"raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education\\\\\\'s primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools.\"?Before the confirmation vote, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted along party lines, 12-11, to refer DeVos\"?nomination to the full Senate.

In Escambia County, Florida -- where uniformed and plain clothed officers are increasing patrols -- the sheriff\\\\\\'s office on Monday called Boyette, 44, and Rice, 37, moving targets, saying they are believed to be moving through wooded areas and may be along the Florida and Alabama border. U.S. Marshals from across the country, along with bloodhounds and helicopters, are taking part in the search, officials said this morning. \"We have a killer in our midst,\" said Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan.     The first reported crime was on Jan. 31, in Santa Rosa County, Florida, when Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Moore, 39, were found shot to death at an inn, Morgan said. Boyette and Rice are both suspects, The Associated Press reported. Greer, a mother of three, was allegedly in an abusive relationship with Boyette, the victim\\\\\\'s father told ABC affiliate WEAR in Pensacola. Authorities say the other victims didn\"t appear to have any connection to Boyette. On Feb. 3, in nearby Baldwin County, Alabama, 52-year-old Peggy Broz was discovered shot to death in her driveway, Morgan said. Officials said today that both Boyette and Rice were involved in the fatal shooting. According to AP, investigators said the duo then stole Broz\\\\\\' car. On Feb. 6, in Escambia County, Florida, 28-year-old Kayla Crocker was shot and injured during a home invasion, they added. Crocker\\\\\\'s white Chevrolet Cobalt was stolen, and Morgan said that video surveillance showed the duo took the car.  We just received these recent pictures of Boyette and Rice.

Bad weather in Europe has already caused a #courgette crisis, alongside a shortage of broccoli, tomatoes, salad peppers and aubergines. With vegetable shortages expected to continue until April, what alternatives are there for shoppers? During the UK\\\\\\'s winter months of December, January and February, UK farmers produce beetroot, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celeriac, chicory, fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, red cabbage, swede and turnips. We\\\\\\'ve become a \"slightly strange group\", expecting all-year-round produce, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Northern Foods, which supplies Tesco. \"Thirty years ago you\\\\\\'d never have worried about buying lettuce in the middle of the winter - lettuces were things that grew in the summer and you ate them in the summer - you ate cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts in the winter,\" he says. As for courgettes, they are actually \"very, very out of season\", says organic vegetable retailer Riverford. We have just got used to supermarkets supplying them all year round. Eating British produce that\\\\\\'s in season is often cheaper, as it is produced locally - and it can be healthier too. According to food industry campaign group Love British Food, fruit and vegetables that are in season contain the nutrients, minerals and trace elements that our bodies need at particular times of year. Apples, for example, are packed with vitamin C to boost our resistance to winter colds. The group\\\\\\'s Alexia Robinson recommends beetroot, kale, cabbages, broccoli and traditional root vegetables for their health-giving properties. Riverford says a slaw made with cabbage, beetroot or swede will offer \"10 times more nutrients\" than an iceberg lettuce - which it says aren\\\\\\'t known for their nutritional value. If you are really keen on iceberg lettuces, you can probably pay a bit more for one from Peru or South Africa, says Lord Haskins. But imported vegetables can clock up a lot of air miles before they land on your plate - making them worse for the environment. Hatty Richards, from the Community Farm in Chew Magna, Somerset, says buying local is better. \"We have such a range on our doorsteps already, it\\\\\\'s fresher, it\\\\\\'s really good for the environment - it reduces air miles - and it supports local business which is crucial.\" Lord Haskins agrees, and suggests your tastebuds may also be grateful: \"We all buy stuff from far parts. They don\\\\\\'t taste nearly as good: strawberries at this time of year from Egypt don\\\\\\'t taste anything like as good as a British strawberry in May, June, July.\" A leafy salad is nice - but there are plenty of alternative dishes to try. Riverford\\\\\\'s Guy Watson thinks the UK\\\\\\'s more bitter winter salad leaves and root vegetables can provide \"a far superior substitute\" which will easily make up for a lack of lettuce. Vibrant winter coleslaws and cauliflower salads \"bring British veg to life\", he says, adding that one of the Riverford Field Kitchen\\\\\\'s most popular winter dishes is a kale caesar salad. Kale, which was originally used to feed cows, is a robust, hardy winder leaf that can withstand frosty weather. It can also be used in soups, stews, stir fries, gratins or just wilted with butter. For Ms Robinson suggests embracing winter comfort food with a \"good old fashioned winter stew with plenty of root vegetables with tender meat\". If you\\\\\\'re still not convinced you can do without leafy salads, try growing your own. Those who do want to eat lettuce need not despair. According to the campaign group Eat Seasonably, lettuce, rocket and other crunchy salad leaves are some of the easiest things to grow at home, all year around - on a seed tray indoors, on your window sill or in the garden. Ms Robinson says: \"As well as the cress there are many great veg that can be easily grown in window boxes such as leaf lettuce, radishes, spinach, green onions and of course a good selection of herbs.\" Another easy win is beetroot, Eat Seasonably says, which can be grown in a big pot. Though beetroot is harvested in October, Riverford says it can last up to four months if it\\\\\\'s kept in a cold storage. \"Carrots are not too hard to grow either,\" Riverford\\\\\\'s Emily Muddeman said, \"Leeks, kale - you could plant just four or five stalks of kale and it will go on sprouting.\" Any budding gardeners could start with planting onions later this month - Eat Seasonably says they are \"not even slightly difficult to grow\".\\'\\n \\'Led by 20-year-old Sima Azimi, the Shaolin Wushu club practises on a snow-covered mountaintop to the west of Kabul. Developed from ancient Chinese martial arts, the sport of wushu sees these young women moving fluidly, slicing the air with silver swords. After learning the sport in Iran, Sima won medals in competition and says: \"My ambition is to see my students take part in international matches and win medals for their country.\" Despite the popularity of martial arts in Afghanistan, women\\\\\\'s sport is severely restricted. All of the women in the club are Hazara, a Dari-speaking, mainly Shia group. They have generally more liberal social traditions that allow them to practise sports outside the home. In addition to the regular dangers of life in Kabul, these women face intimidation and abuse. One member, Shakila Muradi, says: \"There are many people harassing us, but we ignore them and follow our goals.\" Sima has been teaching in Kabul for about a year, training at the club\\\\\\'s gym with her father. This gym has a large poster of stuntman Hussain Sadiqi, a Hazara martial arts champion who fled to Australia to work in film. Her father declares his pride in his daughter. \"I am really happy that I helped, encouraged and supported Sima,\" he says.

The 32-year-old opening batsman led England a record 59 times in Tests. \"I hope I can help the next captain with whatever he needs and drive England forward,\" Cook told BBC Sport. \"I can\\\\\\'t see, for me, it being an issue being led by someone else. I hope I can be part of it and I\\\\\\'m really looking forward to the next stage.\" Cook took over the England captaincy in 2012 and oversaw series victories in India and South Africa, as well as Ashes victories in 2013 and 2015. However his tenure also saw a 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, as well as a 4-0 series defeat in India last year. He is England\\\\\\'s top run scorer in Test cricket with 11,057 runs and 30 centuries. \"It\\\\\\'s a job you need to do at 100% and be committed to everything and I had to be really honest with myself,\" Cook added. \"I couldn\\\\\\'t do that anymore. It\\\\\\'s not a job you can do at 95%. I\\\\\\'m sad to walk away but it\\\\\\'s the right time to do it.\" Cook\\\\\\'s last game in charge saw England slip to an innings-and-75-run defeat against India, the culmination of a run of six defeats in their past eight Tests. The Essex batsman, who was left visibly upset by the final day\\\\\\'s collapse, said after the game that he would consider his future as captain. \"That was kind of maybe the final nail in the coffin. When I left India, I was pretty sure I wouldn\\\\\\'t captain England again,\" Cook said. \"Admitting that isn\\\\\\'t the easiest thing to do, certainly not with my character, but it\\\\\\'s the right decision for me and the right decision for the team. \"It\\\\\\'s such an honour to be England captain and all the bits that go with it. Everything I have been involved with, 59 games as captain, I\\\\\\'ve absolutely loved. Giving that away was very hard.\" Vice-captain Joe Root is the favourite to take over the Test captaincy, having led Yorkshire several times in the County Championship. The 26-year-old, who represents England across all three formats, has scored 4,594 runs at an average of 52.80 since making his debut in 2012. England face Test series in the summer against South Africa and the West Indies, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes. \"The one thing I learnt throughout my career as captain is that you need those people outside, looking in, to help you,\" Cook said. \"My first couple of years I was pretty stubborn that this is the way I should do it, and I didn\\\\\\'t take that much advice outside of England. \"Actually there\\\\\\'s a lot of very good people who watch a lot of cricket, probably more than all of the guys who are playing, who can offer advice. Finding people you trust that way is vitally important and they can help you.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Cook has a win percentage of 40.67 as captain, the fourth best of the six captains to have led England in more than 40 Tests. As captain he managed the return - and subsequent ending - of batsman Kevin Pietersen\\\\\\'s international career in 2014, a year which saw England lose a Test series against Sri Lanka from the penultimate delivery in Headingley and collapse to a 95-run defeat by India at Lord\\\\\\'s. Cook described himself as being \"pretty much at rock bottom\" following the Lord\\\\\\'s defeat, but he received a warm ovation from the crowd in Southampton during England\\\\\\'s next Test, where he made 95. \"When you\\\\\\'re really doubting yourself, to walk out there on that first day was really special for me. It was almost spine-tingling,\" he said. \"It surprised me, to have that warmth of reception. A lot of people walked up to me in the street, saying I was the right man to drive it forward.\" Cook added that he felt the decision to end Pietersen\\\\\\'s England career should have been handled better, and that he did not want the saga to define his captaincy. \"I was part of the decision-making process but I don\\\\\\'t have the power, or didn\\\\\\'t have the power, to decide who played for England. I was just asked my opinion about it,\" he said. \"However I felt at one time I was a bit of a lightning rod for it. That was a hard six months. \"I wouldn\\\\\\'t want my captaincy to be talked about just because of that. I don\\\\\\'t think it\\\\\\'s fair on myself or on the teams.\" Former England spinner Monty Panesar on BBC Radio 5 live Cook has plenty of years left in him and plenty of scoring to do, so I would like to say keep going, keep scoring the runs because he is a run machine. He is definitely one of the best captains England has ever produced. When the pressure is on, he has the ability to stay calm. He is probably the toughest cricketer England have ever produced and probably the most mentally tough. Former England seamer Matthew Hoggard I don\\\\\\'t think there will be any issues with Cook playing under a new captain. [Cook and Root] are good friends and they get on well. Without the burden of having to do all the press, the meetings, the thinking on the pitch, you might find Cook goes on and breaks many records with the bat.

The Italian had been under pressure after a run of just two wins in their last 15 Premier Leagues games. However, the Foxes said in a statement that \"the entire club is and will remain united behind its manager\". \"This is not a crisis,\" Ranieri said following the club\\\\\\'s backing. \"When you aren\\\\\\'t winning you lose confidence, it is normal.\" Leicester are 16th and are without a league win in 2017. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel called the club\\\\\\'s title defence \"embarrassing\" after Sunday\\\\\\'s 3-0 defeat at home to Manchester United. Leicester acknowledged that \"recent form needs to improve\", but said Ranieri would be given the opportunity to turn things around. \"The unprecedented success achieved in recent seasons has been based firmly on stability, togetherness and determination to overcome the greatest of challenges,\" the club said. Ranieri guided Leicester to the Premier League title last season despite the Foxes being 5,000-1 shots. They won the league by 10 points but face becoming the first defending champions to be relegated since 1938, after winning just five league games so far this season. Recent reports suggested Ranieri had lost the support of his players, with the 65-year-old\\\\\\'s squad tinkering and supposed ban on chicken burgers angering some of the Leicester squad.

There was real evidence of fight then but I\\\\\\'m not so sure that steeliness and determination is as prevalent now. I fear for the club this season, but they do have the capability to stay up.

For Barack Obama, the answer was a five-star Caribbean holiday - and a seemingly endless grin. The former commander in chief has been pictured beaming on a beach in a backwards cap, flanked by an equally cheery Michelle. The venue for this masterclass in chilling? Necker island in the British Virgin Islands, owned by British billionaire Sir Richard Branson. Sir Richard posted pictures on his blog of Mr Obama learning to kite-surf, and engaging in a play-fight with the businessman. The airline mogul said he invited the Obamas \"for a complete break\" on his private island after they left the White House. Not every president wants a sunshine stay after the West Wing doors swing shut, however. So which leaders picked elephant hunting, marrying a relative, and a sideline in oil painting...? When the 43rd president left office in January 2009, he ditched Washington for a quiet life between a house in Dallas, Texas, and his 1,500-acre Prairie Chapel Ranch. Keen to enjoy his retirement, the sexagenarian took weekly painting lessons. His subjects included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, and the Dalai Lama - as well as his pets. His inspiration was his great hero Sir Winston Churchill, who turned to art in his forties as a refuge from the tumult of politics. George W Bush paintings go on display Obama asks: What shall I do now? Spotify\\\\\\'s job offer for Barack Obama \"When I get to heaven I mean to spend a considerable portion of my first million years in painting, and so get to the bottom of the subject,\" the wartime leader reportedly said. Mr Bush was less patient, telling his art teacher: \"There is a Rembrandt trapped in this body. And your job is to find it.\" Despite being nicknamed \\\\\\'Teddy\\\\\\' and famously refusing to shoot a bear, the 26th president took a year-long African hunting trip with his son, Kermit, in 1909. The duo were accompanied by more than 200 porters, and scientists from the Smithsonian Institution. They made their way round Africa dispatching over 11,000 animals - including elephants, rhinos, hippos, snakes, zebra, and monkeys among others - before shipping the carcasses home for scientific study. Another exotic trip followed for Mr Roosevelt (and Kermit) in late 1913, when they joined Brazil\\\\\\'s most famous explorer Candido Rondon to chart the course of the River of Doubt. The 760km (472 mile) stretch was ultimately renamed Roosevelt River in his honour. The aforementioned Teddy Roosevelt had no time for Benjamin Harrison, president from 1889-93, branding him \"a cold-blooded, narrow-minded, prejudiced, obstinate, timid old psalm-singing Indianapolis politician\". But none of that stopped the 23rd president from wedding a woman 25 years his junior, who also happened to be his niece by marriage. Mr Harrison\\\\\\'s first wife, Caroline, had died of tuberculosis in 1892. When he wed Mary Dimmick four years later, his two adult children refused to attend the ceremony. America\\\\\\'s first president lived only two years after leaving the job - and spent them making whiskey. In 1799, the year of his death, his distillery in Mount Vernon, Virginia, produced nearly 11,000 gallons - making it the largest in the US at the time. Also a livestock farmer, the founding father used leftovers from the whiskey-making to fatten his pigs. As for the distillery - it\\\\\\'s still going, selling its golden product to tourists at the Mount Vernon Estate and museum.\\'\\n \\'Owning a home by the age of 25 has become an unachievable dream for many over the last two decades. Soaring property prices mean just one in five 25-year-olds own a property, compared to nearly half two decades ago, according to one recent study. But as the government unveils its Housing White Paper, there are some young people who have managed to buck the trend - without help from the bank of mum and dad. Here four young homeowners - all couples - who bought properties in 2016 - reveal just how they did it. Name: Mark Hepburn, age 23. A debt collector on ?18,500 a year Lives with: Partner Laura Starkie, age 25. An accountant on ?20,000 a year Location: Oldham, Greater Manchester House price: ?125,000 for a three bedroom semi-detached house Deposit: ?6,250 (5%) with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme (which ended in December) Why buy a property? We were sick of living at home with each of our parents and wanted our own space. I\\\\\\'d rather live in a house than just a bedroom. We discussed moving out and renting, but we both agreed it was dead money. How did you do it? There was a lot of budgeting. I literally know where every penny goes. I had to drill it into Laura a little bit, but she got used to it after a while. Like her make-up - she had to go for a cheaper brand. We were both working at McDonald\\\\\\'s when we were saving and if there were extra shifts, we would take them. Did you make any sacrifices? There was definitely a lifestyle change when we were saving. We would buy supermarket budget stuff instead of brands. We didn\\\\\\'t go on holiday during the time we were saving up - and that was a massive thing for Laura. How does it feel to be a home owner? I feel ridiculously happy. I feel proud and our friends are too because they know we worked extremely hard for it. Once you get there, you don\\\\\\'t need to worry as much. What if you need to move? I recently went for a job in Bolton, which is not that close to where we are now. The salary was ?27,000 per year, but I wouldn\\\\\\'t move house for that. It would have to be significantly higher to consider jobs away from where we are now. Reaction from friends? I can\\\\\\'t count how many times our friends have asked us how we\\\\\\'ve done it. We just explain you need to save, watch your money and cut back. They\\\\\\'re happy for us and we are just trying to get it into them not to leave it too long and to start saving. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I have got mixed opinions. When Laura and I were at McDonald\\\\\\'s we were on a combined salary of ?23,000 and we managed to save up ?7,000 between us within a year. So I don\\\\\\'t see how people can\\\\\\'t do it. But then we don\\\\\\'t have any kids. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme was a God-send. But if you\\\\\\'re stopping something that\\\\\\'s so good and helping young people, it\\\\\\'s going to cause mayhem. Name: Ruby Willard, age 22. A recruitment consultant on ?19,000 a year plus commission Lives with: Partner Sam Bardell, age 22. An engineer on ?24,000 a year plus overtime Location: Havant, Hampshire House price: ?182,200 for a two-bedroom terraced house Deposit: ?18,220 (10%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property? It was a case of living at home. I moved back into the box room of my mum\\\\\\'s house and I hated it. Sam lived with his parents too so we thought if we can, let\\\\\\'s do it - so we decided to save and go for it. We were looking at renting but to us it was like throwing away money. How did you do it? Being quite tight is probably the answer. When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I\\\\\\'m not going to spend money elsewhere when I don\\\\\\'t need to. We did still have a nice holiday to Greece. I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn ?55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage. Did you make any sacrifices? We may have not had such a big social life. We still did things, but we were conscious. What I did was save what I knew I needed to save, and lived on whatever I had left - which was usually about ?200 a month. I wasn\\\\\\'t buying lunch at work, which would save about ?25 a week. How does it feel to be a home owner? It was weird at first. When we got the keys it was like \"are we on holiday?\" When things started to come together it felt like such an achievement. Everything we had chosen not to do, not going to the cinema one night, helped towards it. What if you need to move? We would be open to the idea, but we would probably look for work closer to where we bought a house, so it probably would affect future decisions. If we did decide we wanted to go somewhere else, we would probably look to sell the house and hopefully we will have made some money on it. Reaction from friends? It\\\\\\'s been quite positive. I have got friends that have bought houses, but a lot of them have had big lump sums of money given to them. Should more young people be able to buy a home? Neither of us completed three years at university, so we probably established a career path earlier than those that do go. I speak to a lot of people that have graduated, and they cannot find jobs that will allow them to borrow enough. It takes years to save a deposit, and then house prices go up and they can\\\\\\'t borrow enough. I think this is how it is now. You might also like... Name: Andrew Douglas, age 23. A social worker on ?31,000 a year Lives with: Partner Kirsty Lamb, age 24. A pharmacist on ?35,000 a year Location: Moredun, Edinburgh. House price: ?145,000 for a two-storey terraced house with two bedrooms Deposit: ?21,750 (15%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property? We decided we wanted to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible. If we get on it now, we would be able to buy what we want by the time we are older and looking to have a family. How did you do it? We started saving at the beginning of 2015 and were probably saving between ?400 and ?500 a month each. We did go on a couple of holidays, so although we\\\\\\'ve been saving, we\\\\\\'ve still been living. We weren\\\\\\'t scrimping, but we do only spend about ?30 a week on food. We check receipts and look for the best deals, so that is more thrifty than most people. Did you make any sacrifices? We spoke about going away for three weeks to somewhere like Australia, but we thought - it\\\\\\'s going to cost ?2,000 each and we can put that towards the house now rather than waiting a few extra months. How does it feel to be a home owner? It feels strange. It does feel like quite a lot of responsibility - I didn\\\\\\'t realise how much. Things like taking out mortgage protection. Our friends call it \"adulting hard\". They\\\\\\'re renting and not really thinking about owning a place and they\\\\\\'re like \"wow, you\\\\\\'ve bought a house\". Reaction from friends? Lots of people think it\\\\\\'s really good, other people say they\\\\\\'re nowhere near that stage. I don\\\\\\'t know if they\\\\\\'re thinking I\\\\\\'m growing up too fast. It\\\\\\'s generally been positive. I don\\\\\\'t know anyone who has done it without a partner, so I think it would be difficult to do it on your own. What if you need to move? With a big move we might give it a trial, and rent out this house while we lived somewhere else. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I do think people complain they can\\\\\\'t afford to buy a house but they go out every weekend, they smoke or they eat out all the time. But property prices have also shot up in the last 20 years with more people buying second homes. There are also people who don\\\\\\'t want to have the responsibility. I think it\\\\\\'s good that the government is helping with Help to Buy schemes and it needs to do more to help first-time buyers. Name: Rebecca Thompson, aged 23. An information analyst on ?21,900 a year. Lives with: Adam Drinkwater, aged 25. A bank administrator on ?16,500 a year. Location: Irlam, Greater Manchester House price: ?126,500 for a three-bedroom semi-detached house Deposit: ?6,300 (5%) with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme and Isa Why buy a property? We lived in a rental flat together for 18 months and realised that the amount we were paying in rent was more or less the same as we would be paying with a mortgage. When we were renting there were a lot of things we couldn\\\\\\'t do, like decorate or move anything around. How did you do it? It was difficult. I was working part-time in my final year at university so I saved my entire wage and lived off my student loan, which wasn\\\\\\'t much. We didn\\\\\\'t go on holiday that year and saved as much as we could. Did you make any sacrifices? We came straight from university, where you\\\\\\'re living on a bit of a shoe-string anyway, so we probably sacrificed but not realised, because we\\\\\\'ve not been enjoying the extra income we\\\\\\'ve had since graduating. We would have probably gone on some more holidays or gone out more and probably bought a few more clothes. How does it feel to be a home owner? It\\\\\\'s brilliant. I feel it\\\\\\'s a really secure base while I\\\\\\'m going on to develop my career. It\\\\\\'s one less thing. A lot of people are aiming towards saving a deposit while I\\\\\\'ve got past it. What if you need to move? It would be really difficult, and it\\\\\\'s definitely an attraction for staying where I am. In my career there are a lot of opportunities down south, but I wouldn\\\\\\'t want to entertain it because of the house prices. It would take us five times longer to save up a deposit, and the amount of income you need to get for a mortgage is totally unobtainable for the average graduate. Reaction from friends? Some live in a more expensive area and I think they were surprised. It\\\\\\'s not something that\\\\\\'s on a lot of people\\\\\\'s radar, owning a home at this age. Particularly if you\\\\\\'re not in a relationship, I don\\\\\\'t think it is affordable. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I think cultures have changed a bit. When my parents were growing up, their parents drilled into them \\\\\\'sort yourself a house, get married and that\\\\\\'s when your life begins\\\\\\'. Now there\\\\\\'s not as much of an emphasis. I think homes do need to be more affordable. It\\\\\\'s silly that the town where we live in, a lot people can afford to buy - whereas only as far south as Birmingham no-one can afford to buy a house earning what we do.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the New York Times of printing inaccuracies, specifically referring to him watching TV in his bathrobe, saying the paper owed President Trump an apology. The president has tweeted his annoyance at what he calls poor reporting: \"The failing @nytimes was forced to apologise to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!\" Unsurprisingly, people have taken to social media to contradict Mr Spicer\\\\\\'s bathrobe comment with various hashtags popping up, including #BathRobeGate. Some have even been delving into the presidential bathrobe archives to produce gems such as this from Avi Bueno. He tweeted a photo of Ronald Reagan in a robe, with the caption: \\\\\\'Weird to see @seanspicer and @realDonaldTrump getting all defensive about a #bathrobe when their hero wasn\\\\\\'t shy about it.\" And historian Michael Beschloss tweeted a picture of President Lyndon B Johnson sitting in a robe with advisers on Air Force One in 1966. John Aravosis, editor of @AMERICAblog, was quick to post three photos of Donald Trump wearing a bathrobe, which had featured in a November Daily Mail article about a trove of Trump memorabilia being found in a US thrift shop. Considering the Trump Organisation lists 37 properties, including 15 hotels, on its website, many posters are assuming that a bathrobe or two may have been worn in the Trump household. Various robes bearing the Trump brand have been posted on social media, including this picture of American actor Mike Rowe. He tweeted a photo in August 2016 of a bathrobe autographed by Mr Trump, along with a video in which Mike says he wore the robe \"briefly\". There were a few robe-wearing alternatives, such as Evie the Cat, the UK Cabinet Office feline who posted this about the 10 Downing Street cat, Larry. And with a clever bit of editing, some have posted gifs of the president holding up a drawing of a bathrobe. Even @TrumpBathrobe, a twitter account set up in 2015 and inactive since September 2016, has reawakened amidst this robing furore. Similar posts are appearing on Facebook under #bathrobegate, although not everyone is impressed: Compiled by Sherie Ryder, BBC UGC and Social News team.\\'\\n \\'By Claire Bernish In no surprise to anyone paying even marginal attention, the FBIâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s clearing Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing in its briefly reopened investigation â\\\\x80\\\\x94... \\'\\n \\'The flu season has been particularly rough in New York City this year with four pediatric deaths from the virus reported in the city, all in January, according to New York State Health Department. The flu has been spreading across the country, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeing epidemic levels of flu activity late last month. There have been 15 flu-related pediatric deaths in the nation during this current flu season, the CDC reported last week. New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania all reported high levels of flu-like activity, according to a CDC flu report last week. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said while the deaths are tragic, the New York cases are not unusual for the flu season. The New York State Department of Health did not disclose the ages of the children or whether they had been vaccinated or had an underlying condition that would have put them at additional risk for complications. \"Every year in our pediatric emergency room come children who are otherwise clearly healthy and they are seriously ill with the flu,\" Schaffner said of Vanderbilt. \"The lesson is that flu can strike even healthy children.\" During the previous flu season, a total of 89 pediatric deaths related to the flu virus were reported in the U.S., according to the CDC.     Public health experts have been concerned about vaccination rates since pediatricians may have had difficulty getting some children to get vaccinated against the flu if they have an aversion to needles, Schaffner noted. While in the past doctors could vaccinate needle-averse children with a flu mist vaccine, they were advised not to use the flu nasal spray this year, since it was found less effective than a vaccine injection. \"It\\\\\\'s clear that the substantial majority of children who die from influenza every year have not been vaccinated,\" Schaffner said, clarifying that he was speaking generally and not about the recent deaths in New York. Flu can cause symptoms of headache, fever, joint pain and cough. The seasonal flu generally spreads across the U.S. from November till March, with the peak number of cases often occurring in February. The number of people affected every year can vary widely, but generally, the CDC reports that \"millions of people are sickened, hundreds of thousands are hospitalized and thousands or tens of thousands of people die from flu every year.\" Children under the age of 1 are at increased likelihood of developing complications if they contract the flu.\\'\\n \\'US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group. \"You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it\\\\\\'s happening,\" he said. \"It\\\\\\'s gotten to a point where it\\\\\\'s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn\\\\\\'t want to report it. \"They have their reasons, and you understand that.\" Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks \"executed or inspired\" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were \"several instances\" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category). We have reproduced the list that was subsequently produced below, and explained what happened in each case and whether we reported on it. Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. Some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point hotly debated on social media. Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent. Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week\\\\\\'s deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City. What happened: A teenager was shot dead after he stabbed two police officers. He was a \"known terror suspect\" whose passport had been cancelled on security grounds. Did we cover it? Yes.

The picture sees 163 of this year\\\\\\'s nominees gathered together and smiling away, but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on. Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year\\\\\\'s photo. 1. Pharrell Williams didn\\\\\\'t exactly dress for the occasion All of this year\\\\\\'s male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits. Well, almost all. The \"dress code\" memo must have gone into Pharrell\\\\\\'s junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater. To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures. Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film, which tells the story of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s. 2. Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck\\\\\\'s facial hair Casey Affleck\\\\\\'s facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world. It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season. It\\\\\\'s now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams, Affleck\\\\\\'s co-star in Manchester by the Sea, who has to peep out from behind his mane. She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight. The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137-minute movie, while Williams\\\\\\'s screen time clocks in at 11 minutes. 3. The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile. He\\\\\\'s the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue - which went on to become Moonlight, one of this year\\\\\\'s most hotly-tipped Oscars contenders. McCraney is so pleased with the film\\\\\\'s success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received, and he is seen here holding up eight fingers. (There is, of course, another explanation. He could be making the \"305\" hand gesture - which is the area code for Miami-Dade county, his home and the place where Moonlight is set.) Also - hats off to Shawn Levy (who\\\\\\'s standing next to Tarell), who wins the award for the most delightfully bright smile of the whole photo. He is the producer of Arrival, which is nominated for best picture. 4. Justin Timberlake needs to sack his tailor \"What\\\\\\'s your inside leg measurement, Justin?\" \"I don\\\\\\'t know, maybe 32 inches?\" \"Hmmm, I don\\\\\\'t have enough material for that. Have a 28-inch pair of trousers instead.\" \"Great, that\\\\\\'ll do, thanks Derek.\" 5. The front row is so where we wanna be Emma Stone, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, Octavia Spencer are all sitting together in the front row. Can someone please organise for us to join this BFF group, that\\\\\\'d be great, thanks. Extra respect for Octavia Spencer for wearing a pair of white trousers while so many of the other female nominees are in a dress or skirt, and for Natalie Portman, who manages to create the illusion she\\\\\\'s impressively wearing high heels even while pregnant with twins. (She is actually wearing her flat shoes and tipping her heels up. Crafty.) Also - Manchester by the Sea producer Kimberly Steward (far right) is that sweet kid in your class who was accidentally never looking at the camera in the school photo every single year. 6. Ryan Gosling needs to cheer up You\\\\\\'re the lead actor in the jointly most-nominated film of all time, pal. Uncross your arms for goodness sake. Slightly happier to be there is the lovely Dev Patel, in the row in front, looking every inch the Hollywood star. He\\\\\\'s come a long way from how he looked at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 when he was starring in Slumdog Millionaire. He told the BBC: \"I first came to Toronto in my school shoes and I had a blazer and I was with Frida [Pinto, his co-star] and they said \\\\\\'You can\\\\\\'t put this guy next to her because he looks so terrible\\\\\\'. I think I got a free penguin suit that didn\\\\\\'t quite fit me and they gave me shoes.\" This year, he\\\\\\'s nominated for best supporting actor and is seen wearing a burgundy Valentino suit. Nice. 7. Is this gap for Meryl Streep? Missing nominees from the photo include Michael Shannon (nominated for best supporting actor for Nocturnal Animals) and Andrew Garfield (best actor, Hacksaw Ridge). But of course, the most notable absentee is Her Royal Acting Highness, Meryl Streep - who is up for best actress this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins. Maybe this gap in the back row behind Denzel Washington was intended for her, and she got held up in traffic. Alternatively, perhaps she\\\\\\'s been to so many of these things she\\\\\\'s just had enough. Either way, we\\\\\\'re pretty sure she\\\\\\'ll be at the ceremony. This year\\\\\\'s Oscars, which will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will take place in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 February.

And, like many IT managers, my users are never happy with the service they get. The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them (my teenage children) spend online and to restrict what they see. A patchwork of different technologies help me do this. It includes: It works, after a fashion, but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet. This involves me walking around the house, kicking my kids off the game console, tablet, phone or TV (delete as appropriate) they are using when they should be doing homework, cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school. Research suggests I\\\\\\'m not alone in using tech to oversee online time - both to limit it and to help them stay safe. About 44% of parents use apps to oversee online activity, 39% check browser histories and 37% put controls on the router, suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec. I use all three of those and want to use more. And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard. It\\\\\\'s perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online, says Nick Shaw, European general manager at security company Norton, because it\\\\\\'s one area where they struggle to find help. \"When people have a parenting problem with their children, they might go to their own parents for advice,\" he says, \"but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are.\" And, he says, children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents. \"A lot of parents are very naive about this,\" he says. Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts. I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety. Wrong. Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks, using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states, my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks. My schoolboy error, says Mr Shaw, was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting. \"Technology is going to help you,\" he says, \"but it\\\\\\'s not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids.\" What I should be doing, he says, is helping them to understand why the controls are needed. Explaining the reasons, he says, can help to defuse some of the objections. It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations. But they have been more of the \"play-less-games-and-do-more-maths\" type rather than the \"anti-virus-stops-your-YouTube-account-being-stolen\" sort. Tony Anscombe, security evangelist at anti-virus company Avast, says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions. \"Sure,\" he says, \"set some rules about how they should use it, but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles. \"A lot of parents just do not have the conversation, talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not.\" This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information, images and videos. Naivety puts many children at risk, he says, and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it. It might not just fall into the hands of cyber-thieves, he says, it might also expose them to cyber-bullying or just be inappropriate to share. Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on, he says, as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need. \"The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do,\" he says. This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess. Some, he says, look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing. \"Gadgets are only half the story, if that,\" says Dr Sonia Livingstone, from the London School of Economics, who studies how children use the internet, as part of her work with the long-running EU Kids Online project. Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle, she says. In addition, she says, parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves, rather than just by dictating terms. It\\\\\\'s about respect too, she says, helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules. If they can see the benefits of the rules, they are more likely to follow them. \"I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children,\" she says. \"Children have rights too.\"\\'\\n \\'\"I know I\\\\\\'ve got to do this. It must be a sickness!\" says Isabel Ettedgui, laughing. It is June 2016, in Mayfair in central London, and she is standing in the middle of a building site. An early 18th Century house is being renovated, ready to be the home of Mrs Ettedgui\\\\\\'s latest venture. She is attempting to relaunch a venerable luxury brand: Connolly, a name famous for its leather for over a century. \"I\\\\\\'ve known this brand for 30-odd years - I still really believe in it. It\\\\\\'s got massive amounts of potential,\" she says. Starting any kind of enterprise is challenging, with many businesses failing within their first few years, and relaunching one can be just as hard. \"Reviving a brand that\\\\\\'s been silent for a number of years is very difficult indeed,\" says consultant and author Peter York. So what\\\\\\'s the best way to go about it? Heritage is one factor that certainly seems to be on Mrs Ettedgui\\\\\\'s side. Look at the websites of many luxury names, and it is clear that history and tradition are some of the factors that brands are most keen to stress. These are attributes that Connolly has in abundance. The firm, which was family-run for much of its history, began producing leather in the late 19th Century. It soon won favour with a huge range of clients. Its leather could be found on the seats of many luxury car marques (including Rolls-Royce), at the Houses of Parliament, on ocean liners such as the Queen Mary, and on supersonic plane Concorde. \"You haven\\\\\\'t lived until you have sat your naked butt on Connolly leather,\" actress Joan Collins is reported to have said. In the 1920s, the company asked W Heath Robinson to produce some illustrations to mark its 50th anniversary. The artist, well-known for his drawings of outlandish devices, was astonished by what he found at the factory in Wimbledon. \"I can\\\\\\'t improve on that, Mr Connolly,\" was his response to one of the firm\\\\\\'s remarkable leather-measuring machines. Decades later, after doing some corporate identity work for the firm, Ms Ettedgui helped the enterprise with a move into retail. \"I just thought, \\\\\\'this is fantastic\"¦they don\\\\\\'t realise what they\\\\\\'ve got,\\\\\\'\" she remembers. The first store opened in 1995, in a mews close to the Lanesborough Hotel in London. Several years later, Mrs Ettedgui\\\\\\'s husband Joseph was offered the retail arm of the business, because the Connolly family had decided to concentrate on the motor trade. Joseph Ettedgui had extensive experience of fashion retailing, having built up the Joseph chain of high-end fashion stores, which had branches across the UK. He and Isabel nurtured the retail side of Connolly, opening a bigger store in Conduit Street in Mayfair. \"Joseph brought in clothes,\" Mrs Ettedgui recalls. \"It taught me that Connolly wasn\\\\\\'t just a brand of briefcases, it had potential to be a fashion brand as well.\" But in the 2000s, Connolly faltered. The family\\\\\\'s leather finishing business experienced an unsuccessful expansion into the US. And in 2010, Joseph Ettedgui died. \"After Joe died, I kept renewing these trademarks and thinking what am I going to do?\" says Mrs Ettedgui. She decided to put everything on hold. A few years later, she began to get the enterprise going once more. She licensed Jonathan Connolly (a fourth generation member of the family) to start producing leather again, while she began to look for a suitable retail location. Her search led her to a Georgian house just off London\\\\\\'s Savile Row. \"It was a little freehold building, which is really rare, and I decided to sell my flat, put everything I could into it and try and launch it without any external backers,\" she says. The house includes several floors of retail space, plus an apartment where Mrs Ettedgui now lives. For her, this is an essential part of the story. \"There\\\\\\'s a desperate need for a different narrative in luxury,\" she says. \"Too many brands are being run in silos by men in suits - what people actually like is to see the owner. \"It\\\\\\'s like when you go to a restaurant and the chef [appears] - it\\\\\\'s such a joy, you feel connected.\" As well as emphasising a personal touch, Mrs Ettedgui has broadened the range of items on sale. In addition to leather goods and clothes, there will be furniture too. \"Beautiful objects, beautiful clothes, well-designed pieces of furniture - it just goes together,\" she says. Reviving a brand, as Mrs Ettedgui is attempting to do, is a tricky thing to pull off. \"The things to think about are: how to explain what happened, because people are suspicious of a relaunch. [You need to] say very clearly what it is you\\\\\\'re about and reconcile that with the previous back story,\" says Mr York. Mrs Ettedgui is conscious of the challenges she faces - but she is cautiously optimistic. After a hectic period of building and renovation, and working around the clock to get everything ready, the store opened in late 2016. Soon afterwards, a customer came in and showed Mrs Ettedgui a Connolly wallet that he had bought 20 years ago. \"He was really happy that we were back,\" she says. To succeed, she believes, \"you need a dream - you need an obsession really. And you need to believe in something that means you can\\\\\\'t not do it.\"\\'\\n \\'Football hooliganism is nothing new in Germany, but when violence broke out before a Bundesliga match between two of the top clubs, this was something different. The stones and bottles thrown and the hate banners displayed by Borussia Dortmund supporters on Saturday exposed a widespread loathing in Germany for a team seen as upstarts, RB Leipzig. The club is challenging for Champions League football in its first ever season in the top flight. The hatred is because of the way they are wholly owned by one company, Red Bull. A wall of hatred was on view: \"Slaughter the bulls\", \"Red Bull, enemy of football\" were some of the milder slogans used. Families came under attack, and six fans and four police were hurt. One top football official Max Eberl said the violence was sick: \"Whether you like RB Leipzig or not, it shouldn\\\\\\'t get out of hand.\" Dortmund\\\\\\'s fans are not alone. One tabloid newspaper, the Berliner Kurier, even refused to print the club\\\\\\'s name a few weeks ago, using the insulting term \"Dosenverkauf\" (Can-sellers) in their Bundesliga table. Selling drinks is the core business of RB\\\\\\'s owner, Red Bull, and there have been plenty more insults since the company bought a team in the Leipzig suburbs in 2009 and oversaw four promotions in seven seasons. Listen to Tim\\\\\\'s BBC World Service programme here: The Rise of RB Leipzig The vitriol derives from RB\\\\\\'s ownership model. Traditionally German football clubs are run without a single, rich investor. It is the members who must control a majority of the shares in the entity that owns the team. But RB Leipzig has only 17 members. It follows the letter of this law, but not its spirit. Among the club\\\\\\'s biggest critics is the chief executive at Borussia Dortmund, Hans-Joachim Watzke. \"It\\\\\\'s a club built to push up the revenues for Red Bull and nothing else,\" he says. Read more on RB Leipzig here: RB Leipzig\\\\\\'s rapid rise \\\\\\'no fairytale\\\\\\' Andreas Bischof, whose blog in Leipzig pokes fun at the new club, goes further. \"This club is not owned or sponsored by a company, this club is like an outlet of a company,\" he says. \"It\\\\\\'s a whole new level of using sports as a marketing vehicle.\" But others argue that RB Leipzig is just what the city and surrounding region need. There has been little Bundesliga football in the former East Germany since unification in 1990. \"Football is a business that needs an enormous amount of money,\" says Martin Machowecz from weekly newspaper Die Zeit. \"And here\\\\\\'s someone who\\\\\\'s come along, got involved and made sure that we\\\\\\'ve now reached the same standard as in West Germany in an area of society that\\\\\\'s important.\" What RB as a club lacks in sporting history, its home city and its stadium provide. Lokomotive Leipzig became a household name when they beat Bordeaux in a penalty shoot-out to qualify for the final of the Uefa Cup Winners\\\\\\' Cup in 1987. The goalkeeper saved two penalties before stepping up to score the winner. Gerlinde Rohr, now director of the Leipzig Sports Museum, was among the reported 110,000 in the stadium that night. \"I was there with a school mate and after Rene Mueller scored his goal I jumped on the seat and we embraced each other,\" she remembers. The Zentralstadion fell into disuse after unification but was given a new lease of life by the 2006 World Cup. The oval embankment of the old stadium was retained and a new stadium built inside it. It\\\\\\'s now called the Red Bull Arena. Many see the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as the turning point for RBL, who had spent two frustrating seasons in the fourth tier before his arrival in 2012. As sports director and, for a brief period, trainer, he oversaw three promotions in four seasons. Ralf Rangnick\\\\\\'s key to success is youth. He likes to buy players who may never previously have had a professional contract and his squad is the youngest in the Bundesliga, with an average age of a little over 23. In his eyes, young players are hungrier for success and fit his playing philosophy. In Leipzig they place huge emphasis on pressing the other team high up the pitch and winning the ball in the opponent\\\\\\'s half. \"Even if you\\\\\\'re the best player in the world and you\\\\\\'re being attacked by three players, you lose the ball,\" he says. Ralf Rangnick also believes in the club\\\\\\'s controversial ownership model. \"What do you need members for? I\\\\\\'m more interested in the number of supporters we have,\" he says. As for suggestions that Red Bull\\\\\\'s owner Dietrich Mateschitz plays a big role in the way the club is run, the sports director says they meet and speak on the phone a handful of times every year. But what of the complaint that RB Leipzig is merely a vehicle for selling cans of energy drinks? \"For us it is completely unimportant,\" he says. \"It\\\\\\'s got nothing to do with what we do.\"\\'\\n \\'A GP practice in Plymouth has reduced the time it takes to get a routine appointment with a doctor from three-to-four weeks to under seven days. The Beacon Medical Group cares for more than 30,000 patients and was formed in 2014 after three practices merged. Dr Jonathan Cope, GP and managing partner at Plympton Health Centre, one of the Beacon practices which has 10 doctors, says, at present, there are 30 unfilled GP posts in Plymouth. Three years ago, his practice was unable to recruit the equivalent of one-and-a-half full-time GPs. \"We made a conscious decision to look elsewhere, to work differently. So we decided to looks at what skills clinical pharmacists, paramedic practitioners and nurse practitioners could offer. We converted that budget to two-and-a-half full-time equivalents.\" Patients registered at Plympton who feel they need same-day care from their family doctor call the reception team at the surgery. Depending on the problem, they will then be called back by an advanced paramedic, pharmacist, nurse practitioner - or a doctor. Dr Cope said: \"Because of the extra capacity, we have freed up the GPs\\\\\\' time. So we are offering more appointments for routine problems, and the waiting times are now shorter.\" The advanced paramedic practitioner, Simon Robinson, responds to any emergency medical problems in the practice, as well as doing, on average, four home visits a day. He says he is often called out to see the more complex cases and his daily schedule allows him to spend more time than the GPs with patients. Simon was keen to point out that if he does have any queries he just has to knock on the GPs\\\\\\' door. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said while paramedics are highly valued and trusted, they have different skills and training. \"GPs are highly trained to take into account the physical, psychological and social factor - this unique skill set cannot be replaced by another healthcare professional, however well meaning the intention is. \"We do not have enough GPs in the NHS - and actually we don\\\\\\'t have enough paramedics either. This transference of workload pressures from one area of the health service to another is not going to benefit our patients in the long term.\" In an effort to understand the pressures on the Beacon Medical Group, the 100 most frequent attendees were analysed. Dr Cope expected the list to be dominated by frail, elderly patients but instead the typical patient was a 37-year-old woman, often with mental health problems, multiple prescriptions and referrals to hospital. From March, a psychiatrist will do a weekly clinic from the surgery for these patients and provide additional training on mental health care to staff. It is part of a parallel drive to offer specialised new services more commonly found in a hospital setting. Dr Helen Frow, a GP with a special interest in dermatology, has provided care to patients registered to the group in the last two years. \"Onward referrals to the hospital have reduced by 85%,\" she said. A similar scheme for musculoskeletal care resulted in 75% fewer secondary care appointments. The model of working with between 30,000 to 50,000 patients in a multi-specialty community provider model is known as a Primary Care Home. There were 14 other sites working to this structure across England in the last year. The National Association of Primary Care is working closely with NHS England to explore how they can continue to expand working in this way. A BMA spokesperson said: \"Many GP practices are increasingly becoming hubs where nurses and other professionals work together to deliver services to patients. \"However, while this is encouraging, England is suffering from a drastic and worsening shortage of GPs that is damaging patient care and restricting the number of appointments on offer to the public. \"The government needs to address this workforce crisis urgently.\" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.\\'\\n \\'Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four-hour A&E target. But that began to change in 2016. Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted, performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn, before it nosedived following Christmas. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital \"It started from Boxing Day onwards,\" says Mr Foster. \"We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick. Seven care homes had to shut too. \"It meant our performance dropped to around 60%. It was the worst three weeks I\\\\\\'ve ever known. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital. The whole system backed up.\" Since mid-January pressures have eased with four-hour performance back above 80%. But Mr Foster is still worried. \"The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients. There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person\\\\\\'s care is too complex. They end up staying in hospital.\" Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London. \"This year things have been closer to breaking point than I\\\\\\'ve ever known it before,\" he says. \"The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years. \"There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren\\\\\\'t any beds available to admit them on to wards. We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night. And it just paralyses the emergency department.\" I don\\\\\\'t think I\\\\\\'ve ever seen such tired, exhausted people - they were absolutely dead on their feet He says patients and their families were understanding, even though they were frustrated. \"The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasn\\\\\\'t anger directed at us - they recognised it was factors out of our control.\" But he says morale was low among staff. \"I don\\\\\\'t think I\\\\\\'ve ever seen such tired, exhausted people, they were absolutely dead on their feet. \"People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point. \"I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did.\" Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department, while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department. She says calling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis, as the Red Cross did in January, \"is not hyperbole, it is the reality\". \"It is the worst I\\\\\\'ve ever known it. I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after vomiting from eating a tin of Quality Street \"During the coalition years we heard the term \\\\\\'black alert\\\\\\' being thrown around, but it would never actually happen, it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack - devastating- but highly unlikely. Now it\\\\\\'s a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off. \"Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been \\\\\\'doubled up\\\\\\' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one. They ask us but we have run out also.\" She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111, the NHS non-emergency phoneline. \"The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side, it\\\\\\'s a total failure. \"I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting - why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in? Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side.\" Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team, bed managers and discharge team. People don\\\\\\'t have time to catch breath before the next onslaught.\" \"It\\\\\\'s been a challenge this winter. I think the main difference has been that it\\\\\\'s been sustained pressure. It\\\\\\'s been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure. \"I\\\\\\'ve been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained, relentlessly pressured winters that I\\\\\\'ve seen. \"People don\\\\\\'t really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures.\" A former nursing manager, she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital. \"We\\\\\\'ve had some very difficult days, which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many, many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported.\" But she says her teams have coped \"remarkably well\" despite the pressure. \"Obviously it\\\\\\'s very difficult. We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey - I think sometimes there\\\\\\'s not an understanding of why that can\\\\\\'t happen. My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening.\" Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham. \"Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter, it\\\\\\'s been really difficult. But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn\\\\\\'t have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care.\" She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an \"outlier\" to be in this situation. Because of the borough\\\\\\'s diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring, the team has had to \"proactively plan\" - but she says \"it\\\\\\'s becoming increasingly difficult going forward\". It\\\\\\'s difficult to see how the system will be sustained She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group. \"Councils are currently prioritising adults and children\\\\\\'s services above other areas of spending, but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that\\\\\\'s been borne out this winter - it\\\\\\'s difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year.\" And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer. \"People have got much more complex needs, multiple long term conditions, so we\\\\\\'ve got that added level of complexity. \"We\\\\\\'ve seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported.\" Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007. She works in a surgery in Lewes, east Sussex. \"The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad. We work 10-12 hours a day without a break,\" she says. GPs are burning out, they are overworked She says the demand on GPs has increased \"because of the pressure on hospitals\". \"A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems. They then bounce back to the hospital. \"The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding, so people are on six to nine-month waiting lists. This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment, including patients who have symptoms of cancer. This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients, it increases their worry and stress.\" She adds: \"There is a real crisis in GP staffing. Lots of practices are closing, so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space. GPs are burning out, they are overworked and many are retiring early. The system is unsustainable now. \"It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices. I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level. It is not safe - the brain can\\\\\\'t make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes. In these cases, quality of care and patient safety is compromised.\" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.\\'\\n \\'The NHS has come under intense pressure this winter, with record numbers of patients facing long waits in accident and emergency units among other challenges.

Bryan, 84, had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation. Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days, eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live. \"I am devastated - six weeks ago everything was fine, now this is not the world I imagined I\\\\\\'d be in. \"In December he was walking into town, doing gardening, he loved mechanics and tinkering. \"Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated, he does not speak and strips naked in public. \"I blame the trauma of the fall and the time he\\\\\\'s been forced to spend in hospital. \"I\\\\\\'m really on edge, I feel like I\\\\\\'m about to fall off a cliff. \"I break down in tears at least once a day. \"He\\\\\\'s had his life taken away too soon. \"Are we saying that because he\\\\\\'s too complicated, our society can\\\\\\'t care for him? \"It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on. \"I just hope to God that he doesn\\\\\\'t understand what is happening to him. \"I feel like he\\\\\\'ll never come home again, he seems lost to us.\" I was driving when I realised I was having a heart attack... it felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest John Perrins was on the M6 motorway, driving home from Cambridge, when he realised he was having a heart attack. An ambulance driver himself, he had feared he would never see his wife again - so intense was the pain. But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road. \"I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest. \"My wife called an ambulance, which arrived within 10 minutes - seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing I\\\\\\'ve ever seen. \"I passed out, but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage - 90 compressions. \"When I came round they spoke to me and, although I was scared, the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe. \"The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal. \"A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died - I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew. \"They have given me my life back. \"The paramedic was treating me, teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance - I could not have asked for a better person. \"I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew - I want to find them so I can say thank you.\" Trevor Dallimore-Wright says his local GP and hospital are \"like a family\" to him, regularly providing life-saving care for his complex health conditions. \"The NHS has been absolutely brilliant,\" says Trevor, from London, who has diabetes and depression. \"My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital - I would give her 10 out of 10. \"I\\\\\\'ve had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis - I went to A&E and was treated very quickly. \"They\\\\\\'ve had a great impact on my life. \"NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed. \"My GP is extremely kind and patient.

When the procedure was scheduled for early January, she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work. But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space. She is still waiting. \"I\\\\\\'d prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery. I prepared frozen dinners for my kids, they are seven and 13, and I said a farewell goodbye. \"Then in the morning the nurse called me and said, \\\\\\'We have no bed for you.\\\\\\' \"I was gutted.

In an address to Parliament, President Klaus Iohannis, a critic of the two-month-old government, said the majority of Romanians now believed the country was going in the wrong direction. \"Romania needs a government that is transparent, which governs predictably by the light of day, not sneakily at night,\" the president said, referring to the late hour the government passed an emergency ordinance last week aimed at decriminalizing some forms of official corruption. The move \"?which bypassed Parliament and was not signed off by Iohannis, who has limited powers \"?ignited the biggest protests seen since communism ended in the country in 1989. As a result, the government will now seek to introduce the plan in Parliament. Thousands gathered for the eighth consecutive evening in Victory Square outside the government offices, shouting \"Social Democratic Party, the red plague!\" and \"Resign!\" In smaller numbers, about 2,000 protesters gathered outside the presidential palace yelling \"Get out, you traitor!\" Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 by direct vote, was chairman of the opposition Liberal Party. He quit the party that year to stand as president. He has been critical of the government headed by Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, which came into being after the December parliamentary elections. The government \"has been saying publicly I can\\\\\\'t stomach the result of the vote ... that I\\\\\\'d overturn a legitimate government,\" Iohannis said. \"That\\\\\\'s false.

In his speech, Iohannis pressed ahead with an earlier initiative to hold a referendum on another government initiative to pardon prisoners. Critics say the proposal will help government allies convicted of corruption. Dragnea, the main power broker behind the government, expressed disappointment Iohannis did not deliver a \"speech of unity,\" and said \"he should leave the government alone, to govern.\"\\'\\n \\'The claim: The NHS could recover between ?200m and ?500m annually from foreign patients if a system of charging them in advance for non-emergency care worked perfectly. Reality Check verdict: The NHS recovered ?289m in 2015-16 and ?500m is the government\\\\\\'s target for 2017-18. The NHS may struggle to meet that target, but it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be recouped by a perfect system. NHS hospitals in England are to be forced to charge patients from overseas up front for non-emergency care if they are not entitled to free treatment. Dr Mark Porter, from the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 5 live that the amount that could be recovered if the charging system worked perfectly was between ?200m and ?500m a year. He went on to say that was not very much money in the context of NHS spending and deficits, bearing in mind that the NHS budget in England was ?116.4bn in 2015-16. A report - based on 2013 figures - estimates that treating all visitors and migrants in England (not just in hospitals) costs the NHS about ?2bn, although it warns there is considerable uncertainty about that figure. That includes treating tourists who become ill while on holiday and longer-term migrants who have paid surcharges on their visas to be entitled to NHS care. Not all of that ?2bn could be recovered. Treatment in A&E, for example, is free for everyone up to the point when a patient is either admitted to hospital or given an outpatient appointment. The government does recoup some of the ?2bn, although not as much as it would like. It has a target to recoup ?500m of the cost of treating overseas visitors by 2017-18. It has made considerable progress towards that goal, increasing the amount recouped from ?97m in 2013-14 to ?289m in 2015-16. A big proportion of that increase, ?164m of it, has come from a health surcharge that must be paid by most students and temporary migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) applying for visas to come to the UK for more than six months. Patients from inside the EEA with EHIC cards are generally treated free, with the government applying to their home countries to cover the cost. Those from elsewhere in the world who are not covered by the health surcharge will be charged for the cost of their treatment. Trusts are now allowed to charge 150% of the cost of treatment to patients from outside the EEA. The NHS has not been particularly good at recouping the costs in the past because trusts have not been good at identifying which patients should be charged for their treatment and it is difficult to collect money from patients living outside the EEA once they have returned home. The authorities have also not been particularly good at recouping the costs of treating people from EEA countries. This report from the National Audit Office said that on current trends the NHS would not manage to recover ?500m a year by 2017-18, although that was before the announcement of the change to the rules so that non-urgent care must be paid for upfront. The NAO estimated that trusts only manage to recover about half of the amount they invoiced overseas patients. The Department of Health estimated that in 2012-13 the potentially recoverable amount was ?367m, but it excluded from that figure the estimated cost of between ?100m and ?300m for a combination of people who had travelled to England purely to receive urgent treatment and regular visitors who are described as \"taking advantage\" of the system by registering for GP services and other NHS services to which they are not entitled. All of these figures are estimates. Looking at the bottom end of the range, ?200m is too low a figure as it is considerably less than is currently being collected. At the top end, ?500m is the government\\\\\\'s target - it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be collected by a perfect system.

Crisis and sanctions did not prevent operations of Russian banks in Cyprus and they managed to reinforce positions there, Russian ambassador in Cyprus Stanislav Osadchiy told TASS in an interview on Tuesday.   \"Concerning our banks represented in the island, they did not merely manage to stay afloat in conditions of recession but strengthened positions there,\" the ambassador said. \"As far as we are aware, anti-Russian sanctions introduced by the European Union did not interfere with their operations,\" he said. \"RCB Bank [a subsidiary of Russia\\\\\\'s VTB24] is among leading credit institutions in Cyprus, included recently by the ECB into ranks of four systemic Cyprus banks of the Eurozone,\" Osadchiy said. \"Compared to other credit institutions, RCB Bank is highly liquid and proactively expands its network on the island - subsidiary offices were opened in Nicosia and Limassol in 2015,\" the diplomat said. Russia\\\\\\'s Promsvyazbank also has an office in Limassol, he added. Relations between Russia and Cyprus maintain positive dynamics, the ambassador said. \"Close economic cooperation, though frequently exposed to challenging tests, continues to be their driver,\" he added.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. The number of Russians visiting the Republic of Cyprus in 2016 grew by 50% compared to the previous year, reaching a record high, Russian Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus Stanislav Osadchy said in an interview with TASS. \"Last year was a year of records for the Cypriot tourism industry, which became possible largely due to a significant growth in the Russian tourist inflow,\" he said. \"According to the official data provided by the Cypriot statistics agency, the number of our fellow citizens visiting Cyprus neared 800,000, which is more than any previous annual numbers and almost 50% more compared to 2015.\"   The Russian diplomat also said that although the significant increase in the number of Russian tourists was a result of flights to Egypt being suspended, however, the trend for the growing Russian tourist inflow to Cyprus had remained for the past few years. Osadchy pointed out that Cypriots had been taking more and more interest in Russia due to increasing business cooperation, strengthening personal ties, religious and cultural closeness between the two peoples. \"More Cypriots have been visiting our country as tourists,\" he added. \"Even consular statistics prove that as around 6,000 visas were issued last year.\" \"I would like to emphasize that the Republic of Cyprus was recognized by the world community while the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) located in the northern part of the island is unrecognizes and is not controlled by Nicosia,\" the Russian diplomat said. \"In other words, if our fellow citizens find themselves in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus it means they are outside the legal system of the Republic of Cyprus.\" The ambassador pointed out that arrivals via the northern part of the island \"are viewed by the Cypriot authorities as illegal and are actually a criminal offence.\" \"This is why we strongly recommend our fellow citizens to arrive only through the airports and sea ports of the Republic of Cyprus,\" Osadchy said. \"Unfortunately, we often hear that some Russian nationals, either out of ignorance or on the off chance, attempt to cross the buffer zone so the Cypriot authorities arrest them. Often times it leads to deportation, but there have been some more complex incidents,\" the Russian ambassador added. He stated that the Russian embassy\\\\\\'s consular department \"provides assistance to Russian nationals no matter in what part of the island they are.\" \"However, there are no consular centers in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, our possibilities are limited there,\" Osadchy said. \"Embassies of other countries have been facing the same problem.\" \"For humanitarian reasons, as well as in order not to leave Russians permanently residing in the northern part of the island without assistance, our consulate officials receive Russian nationals in the buffer zone on a regular basis,\" the ambassador concluded.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russia is ready to take part in an international conference of the Cypriot settlement if necessary, Russia\\\\\\'s Ambassador to Cyprus Stanislav Osadchy told TASS on Tuesday.   \"The terms under which the island will be reunified are to be approved by Cyprus\"?population at a referendum,\" he said. \"On our part, Russia, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, is ready to support the positive result of such plebiscite, to guarantee unimpeded implementation of the parameters of comprehensive settlement, to secure the Cypriot communities from imposed ready-to-use settlement formulas in the interests of third players, and to take part in an international conference of the Cypriot settlement along with other member countries of the United Nations Security Council, should it be needed.\" He added that terms for Cyprus\"?reunification are to be approved by the population at referendum. He said that it is crucially important \"not to hinder the Cypriots\" in the settlement process. \"Unlike a number of our foreign partners, Russia has been consistently saying that it is up to the Cypriot communities to decide on the settlement parameters, without any foreign interference,\" he stressed. According to the Russian diplomat, a favorable environment for the Cypriot settlement came to existence when Cyprus\"?President Nikos Anastasiadis and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci took charge of the negotiating process in May 2015. \"It did not take long for the two communities\"?leaders to established trust-based relations dubbed by United Nations Secretary General\\\\\\'s Special Adviser on Cyprus Espen Barth Eide as \"Good chemistry.\"?Over the months that have elapsed since then, the communities managed to bridge gaps on a number of aspects on the negotiating process,\" Osadchy said.   By now, the negotiating process \"has actually entered a decisive stage,\" he said. \"For the first time, it has been joined by representatives of the guarantor states - the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. Much will now depend on the political will of Anastasiadis and Akinci, their readiness for compromises in the name of the common goal of the island\\\\\\'s reunification,\" the Russian diplomat said. Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1974 after Turkey invasion of the northern part of the island that followed a state coup staged by supporters of Cyprus\"?unification with Greece. As a result of combat operations, Turkey won control of about 37% of the island\\\\\\'s territory where the Turkish Cypriot community unilaterally declared independence and formed the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983. Turkey is the guarantor for Northern Cyprus while the island\\\\\\'s southern part constitutes the Republic of Cyprus populated primarily by Greek Cypriots. The two communities have been holding U.N.-brokered negotiations for decades.\\'\\n \\'To anyone relying on the \"not enough troops to indicate concern\" defense page: 1 link This is something of an offshoot thread, but it is in response to something I have seen posted in multiple threads of late.

He argued that the order, which blocks travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country, \"will prevail [in court] and be able to take the steps necessary to protect our nation.\"     Kelly repeatedly disputed that the executive order is a Muslim ban, insisting it\\\\\\'s just a \"pause\" based on security concerns. He said five of the seven countries named in the order are \"nearly failed states\" and four of them don\\\\\\'t have U.S. embassies. \"So I\\\\\\'m at a total loss to understand how we can vet people from various countries when in at least four of those countries we don\\\\\\'t even have an embassies,\" he said.

When asked to clarify, Kelly responded, \"Not until they act to blow something up or go into a mall and kill people.\" He continued, \"The vetting on the other end, in those seven countries, are suspect. And Mr. Trump, and certainly in my view, we have to do a pause, which he ordered. Now is under court action, so that we can take a look at what we\\\\\\'re doing on the other end.

Russia\\\\\\'s military hardware exports yielded about $15 billion for the state coffers in 2016, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday. The Russian premier cited these data at an enlarged session of the United Russia faction in the national parliament.   \"The state defense order has been actually 99% fulfilled and this has never happened before,\" Medvedev told members of the ruling United Russia party, which he heads. \"The export deliveries of military hardware as part of military and technical cooperation have brought about $15 billion, which allows us to keep our positions on the world armaments market,\" the premier said. Russia is placed 2nd on this market after the United States, Medvedev said. \"It is important for us to retain this market,\" the premier said. According to the premier, Russian defense enterprises have increased production by more than 10% Last year, Russia\\\\\\'s aircraft-making industry increased military production by almost 3.5% while its civilian output grew by about 20%,\" the premier said. \"Russia is developing principally new models of aircraft, such as the MC-21, which will fly using the promising PD-14 engine. Quite recently, the plane was rolled out in Irkutsk,\" Medvedev said, expressing the hope that the project would develop according to plan. Domestic ship-building has also demonstrated fairly good results, the premier said. \"Defense output in this sphere grew by more than 2% while the civilian segment of ship-building increased by 11%,\" Medvedev said. -Conditions should be created for export expansion of Russian industrial products to global markets, he went on.   \"Our industry should be competitive; goods manufactured by our industry should enjoy demand on the domestic and on the international markets. We must create all the conditions for the so-called export expansion,\" Medvedev said. Defense industry companies should also meet such criteria, particularly on account of making dual-purpose products, the Prime Minister said. The defense industry was often the source for technologies development in the non-defense sector, Medvedev said. \"The situation has reversed at present all over the world - the non-defense sector and its advance areas are very often pushing defense technologies forward,\" he added. There is also a need to implement innovations in the industry, Medvedev said. This will \"make possible to perform the quickest possible upgrade of branches currently lagging behind and create modern and high-technology jobs,\" he added. Medvedev considers it appropriate to maintain measures to support the non-oil-and-gas sector of the Russian economy.   \"I think this is right, I hope that the Minister meant this (Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov - TASS) - to maintain the set of measures of support that we approved in order to strengthen the non-oil sector,\" Medvedev said. The Prime Minister recalled that in 2016, these measures led to a growth in the light industry, in production of railway rolling stock, in forestry sector and other sectors. According to Medvedev, initially those measures were criticized in the Cabinet. \"But there is one criterion of truth - it is the result. If, despite these measures od support, the industry continued to decline, in that case it would be necessary to review them and to focus on other areas, but the industry is growing,\" the Prime Minister said. \"That\\\\\\'s why we decided to keep these measures of support,\" Medvedev said. He added that some of the support mechanisms will be revised and other forms of industrial incentives will be introduced.\\'\\n \\'MURMANSK. February 7. /TASS/. Development of the Arctic, as a priority direction of the Russian state polices, has increased the demand for qualified specialists in various fields. Experts say, the region is in demand for not adventurers, but for well-trained experienced specialists skilled to working in the North. Besides, of high demand are scientific suggestions on both development of the Arctic and on maintaining its natural conditions.   Analysts of the HeadHunter recruiting portal say that open positions in the Russian Arctic regions (like the Sakha Republic, Nenets, Yamal-Nenets, Chukotka) in January 2017 doubled year-on-year. \"The biggest demand was for sales positions (28% of the vacancies the regions published in January 2017), raw materials exploration and development (16%), banking (14%), blue-collar positions (13%), and personnel for production facilities (12%). Most vacancies come from companies related to production of gas, oil, minerals, to development of open pits or to industrial construction,\" the company said. Most often, the companies were looking for applicants with working experience from one to three years (40%) and from three to six years (32%), while 23% of listed jobs were for applicants without experience. The average offered salary of 60,000 rubles (about $1,000 a month) goes next to 174,000 rubles for a programmer or 157,000 for a mining engineer working shifts. Candidates most often are guaranteed not only food and bed, but also laundry services, libraries and gyms. Misbalance between demand and offer in human resources in terms of territory and professional skills - this is how expert of the Presidential Academy Vera Smorchkova characterized in a conversation with TASS the biggest problem, which affects the social and economic development of the Arctic regions. She said about a lack of a balanced system for training and forecast to see what professions will be of demand on the Arctic market in five or seven years.   The projects to implement systematic approaches in personnel training for the Arctic are only at the level of tests now. For example, the Murmansk region - the only part in the North-Western Federal District - is testing a standard of human resources for industrial growth purposes. The project involves employers, universities, authorities and the WorldSkills movement. The standard is used to forecast human resources demand and develop focused training, to organize independent evaluation of training, and the system for additional education for children. The region\\\\\\'s six leading companies have agreed to participate in the test: mining, shipbuilding and other companies. Across the country, the standard is tested in 21 regions. Northern regions also do not forget about representatives of the indigenous peoples. The department of education at the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District told TASS about training of nomadic teachers for schools and kindergartens. \"Today, in Yamal\\\\\\'s tundra work 17 \"\\\\x98chum\"?(dwelling of nomadic peoples) kindergartens and five schools,\" the department said. Yakutia, for the purpose of supporting the locals, makes big companies working in the region employ the locals first of all, head of the region Yegor Borisov told TASS. \"Companies, working in development, do not have problems with personnel, and in work with those companies we set only one task - to employ more locals,\" he said. Thus, over the recent five years Alrosa (diamond producer) employed 18,000 local residents, and Surgutneftegaz (oil and gas producer) - 2,000 people. Companies working on Arctic projects - Norilsk Nickel, Rosneft, Gazprom and others - have been initiating educational programs. As yet, the Presidential Academy\\\\\\'s expert said, cooperation between educational institutions and businesses has been on first stages of development - only five percent of educational programs are implemented in cooperation with employers.   For example, Norilsk Nickel, under its corporate programs on working with students, cooperates with more than 15 Russian core universities. The company\\\\\\'s press service told TASS about a few working projects, including a program to develop human capital - Conquerors of the North, which in 2016 won the national competition among projects involving graduates and young specialists. The company\\\\\\'s second program is the Cup MISIS Case and the Cup Technical competitions in business cases. In 2016, more than 200,000 students from 65 universities in 25 cities participated in the first championship, and more than 350,000 from 250 universities in 35 cities participated in the second competition, which was aimed at solving more scientifically-technical practical cases. Many universities now give forecasts what professions will be of demand in the Arctic. For example, the Tyumen Oil and Gas University in 2000 opened a department of the Earth\\\\\\'s cryology. Academician Vladimir Melnikov says, every year the department educates specialists in studies of natural and natural-technical processes in the Earth\\\\\\'s cold regions. In 2016, the University opened the first in the world department of cryo studies, to working at which the University invited leading scientists from the U.S., Mexico, Israel, Finland, Sweden and Norway. The North (Arctic) Federal University opened the Arctic innovation center to implement results of research made by scientists and students. The university opened 24 small innovative companies to implement scientific results. One of the companies has offered technical characteristics and technology for production of autoclaved cellular concrete, using local mineral resources. Cooperation of universities, training specialists for work in the Arctic, with other countries in the educational and scientific spheres becomes a popular trend. The North (Arctic) University has close relations with educational institutions in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Canada and the U.S. More than 400 students and 300 teachers every year participate in academic exchange programs, and 80% of all the students\"?and 40% of the teachers\"?exchanges are organized with universities in the Arctic countries.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Growing tensions in Ukraine could benefit Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko who is seeking to distract the world\\\\\\'s attention from Kiev\\\\\\'s inability to implement the Minsk agreements, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told TASS on Tuesday.   \"Media outlets such as Radio Liberty and the Foreign Policy Magazine, receiving funds particularly from the US Department of State, are now saying that the current tensions (in Donbass) could benefit, first and foremost, the Poroshenko regime, seeking to distract attention from its inability to implement its obligations and to make the (Trump) administration believe that it is Russia who is to blame,\" Lavrov said. \"If someone hopes that all Ukraine\\\\\\'s problems will be solved as soon as Kiev regains full control of Donbass, they are wrong for it is impossible. It is clear for everybody in Europe, including Paris, Berlin and Brussels, as well as in the US, even the previous US administration came to understand it in the end,\" Lavrov stressed. \"This is why Kiev cannot avoid fulfilling its obligations under the Minsk agreements.\" According to the Russian foreign minister, the Normandy Quartet has been drawing up a road map that would coordinate steps aimed at implementing the Minsk agreements. \"These processes should go together,\" Lavrov noted. \"The president (of Russia Vladimir Putin) spoke about it in detail at a press conference in Budapest.\"\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov will have a meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in Moscow on February 8 to exchange views on the progress in the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear program and discuss bilateral relations, a diplomatic source told TASS on Tuesday.   \"Top-ranking Russian and Iranian diplomats will hold consultations in Moscow on February 8 on the development of bilateral relations and on regional and international affairs,\" the source said. \"They are also expected to discuss progress in the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear program.\" A deal on Iran\\\\\\'s nuclear program was reached between Iran and six international mediators (the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Russia, the United States, and France) on July 14, 2015. On January 16, 2016, the parties to the deal announced beginning of its implementation. Under the deal, Iran undertakes to curb its nuclear activities and place them under total control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in exchange of abandonment of the sanctions imposed previously by the United Nations Security Council, the European Union and the United States over its nuclear program.\\'\\n \\'SOCHI, February 7. /TASS/. Russian cities of Kazan, Sochi and St. Petersburg are ready for submitting bids to host Olympic Games, Alexander Zhukov, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), said on Tuesday.   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said earlier in the day that the government was ready to provide support in case residents of the country\\\\\\'s second-largest city of St. Petersburg would grant approval for their city to bid for hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics. \"There are several cities across Russia ready for hosting the Summer Olympics and they are Kazan, Sochi and St. Petersburg,\" Zhukov told journalists. \"These cities are capable of submitting bids.\" \"We have a good experience of hosting the Games in Sochi,\" the ROC president said. \"I am positive that Russia is able to host-major sports competitions at the highest possible level.\" In February and March of 2014, the Russian resort city of Sochi hosted the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, which, according to international sports officials, athletes and visitors, were organized at the highest level possible and provided up-to-date infrastructure at all levels.\\'\\n \\'WARSAW, February 7. /TASS/. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed during their phone talk on Tuesday new Normandy format steps on settling the Ukrainian crisis, Germany\\\\\\'s leader said. \"I have again talked to President Vladimir Putin today because we\\\\\\'r concerned over the situation in east Ukraine,\" the German chancellor said at a press conference in Warsaw after talks with Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo. \"We have agreed on further steps that can be taken within the Normandy format,\" she added.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law decriminalizing domestic violence. The law has been published on Russia\\\\\\'s official website containing legal information. The law declares domestic violence an administrative, rather than criminal, offence, provided it is a first-time transgression.-   The law amends Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code by excluding physical assaults on relatives from criminal offences while a person who commits repeated assaults will face criminal charges. In June 2016, first-time battery was declared an administrative offence, however, it was announced that if those committing battery were motivated by hooliganism, political, ethnic and ideological enmity, or were assaulting their relatives, would face criminal charges. The decision whipped up turmoil in society leading to protests against first-time domestic battery being declared a criminal offence. According to Russian MP Yelena Mizulina, \"there are 59 articles stipulating criminal responsibility for violence\" so there is no need to amount domestic battery to physical assaults committed out of hooliganism or any kind of enmity. \"We mean physical assaults that do not require a medical report as they do not result in injuries, these are family disputes with minor consequences,\" she elaborated. The administrative offence for first-time battery envisages an arrest for ten to fifteen days, a fine of 5,000 to 30,000 rubles (roughly $85 - 500) or compulsory community service for 60-120 hours. Meanwhile, those charged with repeated assaults will face criminal charges under Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code which stipulates a fine of up to 40,000 rubles (roughly $670), compulsory community service for up to six months or an arrest for up to three months. -\\'\\n \"MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/.

Fundamentalists of various stripes, survivalists, and certain ideologues seem to be, at worst, determined to bring about its collapse. Worst of all, to my mind, the general population gazes upon the looming demise of civilization with an apparent indifference that is astonishing.\\\\nScientifically, the exact process by which civilization got started is not known. It is known to have something to do with the development of farming.\\\\nEven the Bible endorses that, for those who know the story of Cain, the farmer who killed his brother Abel and is credited with building the world\\\\\\'s first city. (Technically, \"civilization\" means \"living in cities.\") Also, any estimated age of Earth that I have seen that was calculated using the Bible (which calculations always start with Cain\\\\\\'s parents, Adam and Eve) has turned out to be a fair-to-excellent estimate of the age of civilization.\\\\nAt any rate, farming made relatively large surpluses of food possible. That allowed for the existence of significant numbers of people who were not concerned with procuring food, other than to own a farm, buy food, or, in the case of slaves, have it provided by their owners.\\\\nThere is no doubt that slavery was present from the beginning of civilization. My theory is that groups of warrior-like people offered farmers protection from raiders in exchange for food. Then they realized that they could turn their enterprise into a protection racket, in which they extorted most of the food from the farmers. Before long, they realized that maximum efficiency would be achieved by simply enslaving the farmers.\\\\nThe enslavers also used slaves to build fortresses. Those fortresses became the seed crystals of cities, where people could live and be protected from the worst the world had to offer by submitting to the local tyrant.\\\\nAs local tyrants conquered more territory their wealth grew and so did their cities. The Roman Empire was the apotheosis of that process.\\\\n[Serfdom, the slightest possible moral improvement over slavery, was the basis of feudalism, which technically was not civilization because it was not predicated on the existence of cities.]\\\\nCivilization is now threatened with extinction. It might not be much morally, but materially it is all we\\\\\\'ve got. Civilization as we know it does at least protect the farmers without extorting or enslaving them.\\\\nIf civilization were to collapse there is no doubt that some human beings in small groups would be able to scratch out a subsistence existence here and there. Life would surely be, as Thomas Hobbes would say, \"nasty, brutish, and short,\" but human life would continue in some form.\\\\nOr, we can make the effort to save civilization. If we want to avoid the worst, we have to start immediately.\\\\nThe primary threat to civilization is a material threat. It is a scythe aimed at the legs upon which civilization has always stood: farming.\\\\nThe threat is global warming. The temperature of the air and the water on surface of this planet is increasing.\\\\nPeople who deny that global warming is happening are being irrational. I don\\\\\\'t endorse locking them up, but I do endorse ignoring them while those of us who are not irrational (in that way, anyway) get on with saving civilization.\\\\nFor as long as civilization has existed, Earth has had a stable-enough climate that has supported large-scale agriculture. Now that is changing.\\\\nSome people seem to think that we can simply shift crops northward to suit the new temperatures. That would be wrong.\\\\nGlobal warming will create such climatic dislocations that agriculture as we know it will cease to exist. If agriculture as we know it ceases to exist, civilization will cease to exist.\\\\nThe ultimate cause of global warming is beside the point. Arguing about that is like standing in the yard while one\\\\\\'s house is on fire, arguing with one\\\\\\'s spouse about the cause of the blaze. As the late, great Gene Wilder would doubtlessly say, eyes and hair equally wild, The... HOUSE... is on... FIRE . PUT... the FIRE ... OUT !\\\\nWhatever is the cause of global warming, we only have one response available to us. We have to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases being disgorged into the atmosphere.\\\\nOne big thing we can do immediately is to turn off our air conditioners wherever that is at all feasible. (Modern high-rises don\\\\\\'t permit it, but it can be done everywhere else.) Fans consume a small fraction of the electricity that air conditioners do. It is a great irony that burning mountains of coal to make ourselves cooler has contributed to getting us into this mess, but there you go.\\\\nThe survival of civilization depends upon stopping global warming... now! If we fail to do that, civilization is kaput.\\'\\n \\'Its a disgrace , they have wrecked the FBI , its worse than Hoover and thats saying something , they have to make a stand sometime ,its getting like Alcapone arresting Alcapone .

Moscow is confident that the results of the war on terror under the administration of US President Donald Trump will be more significant than under Barack Obama, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told TASS on Tuesday. \"We have always said at all the stages, including during last year\\\\\\'s marathon between me and [former US Secretary of State] John Kerry, between our militaries, which finally ended in the approval of a very specific document on coordination but which was rejected by the US administration, that apart from the procedures of avoiding unforeseen incidents, we should establish real coordination for agreeing targets and delivering strikes against terrorists\"?positions,\" the foreign minister said.   As the Russian foreign minister said, the agreements with the Obama administration on this score had not been fulfilled. At the same time, the Trump administration \"took a specific, even if a one-off action already in the first days of its work in the White House [the provision of terrorists\"?coordinates in the province of Aleppo on January 22] in the struggle against the Islamic State terrorist organization [outlawed in Russia],\" Russia\\\\\\'s top diplomat said. \"I believe that this characterizes one and the other administration,\" the Russian foreign minister said. \"To my mind, the incumbent US administration is far less ideologized and far more focused on the specific result,\" Russia\\\\\\'s top diplomat said. \"I\\\\\\'m confident that with this approach the result will be more significant and weightier,\" Lavrov said.   Lavrov also said that Trump\\\\\\'s commitment to come to grips with the core of the Ukrainian problems is seen as a \"qualitative change\" as compared with the position of his predecessor. \"You know what kind of position Donald Trump has taken: he said he wants to come to grips with problems in Ukraine to be able to see how the parties are behaving.

The first session of a joint task force on monitoring ceasefire in Syria, comprising representatives of Russia, Turkey, Iran, and also the United Nations and Jordan, was held in Kazakhstan\\\\\\'s Astana on February 6. The task force was set up after the January 23-24 conference on the Syrian settlement in Astana. Jordan\\\\\\'s representatives said in Astana that opposition groups in Syria\\\\\\'s southern provinces are ready to join cessation of hostilities and conduct combat actions against the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra.   Since 2013, Sabi has been an active participant of the Syrian peace initiative on establishing dialogue between the government and the opposition. He said progress reached in Astana creates necessary conditions now for a successful intra-Syrian dialogue in Geneva due on February 20 under the auspices of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura. \"The Astana meeting was the first conference over the past six years that brought practical results,\" Sabi said. \"All the sides should think about the importance of continuing the work in this direction of settling the Syrian crisis.\"\\'\\n \\'Britain to send hundreds more troops to Russia border as Cold War tension escalates page: 1 link Britain will send hundreds more troops close to Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s border, the Government has said, as the Prime Minister also called for â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpressureâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d on Moscow over the Syria crisis.

I realize that the word \"harassment\" is used in the quote above, but how does that word fit in this context? It seems like it could be a coded message. Either way, \"the harassment of EU & NATO forces\" sounds like it could be an act of war to me. That\\\\\\'s the essence of my argument for why WW3 has already started. It\\\\\\'s well past the point of \"saber rattling\" and \"posturing\", actual harassment/terrorism/warfare (take your pick of words) is involved. It\\\\\\'s American election time.

Turkey can go too. This is right, and not only for warmongerers reasons! But we also should not forget that these miniature states are only used too, like the rest of dumb europe. By the anglo-american axis, some call it meanwhile the new axis of evil. Bceause, for the simple reason that russia didnÂ´t break made promises, after the Globalists \"reunited\" Germany, letÂ´s better say brought down the wall(To be honest, there is no unity between german people, often not even in the own families, less than ever between the east and west of germany). The broken promises were about the eastward enlargement of the NATO. NATO\\\\\\'s Eastward Expansion Did the West Break Its Promise to Moscow? \"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the West of breaking promises made after the fall of the Iron Curtain, saying that NATO\\\\\\'s expansion into Eastern Europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over German reunification. Newly discovered documents from Western archives support the Russian position.\" Russia didnÂ´t expand his military troops to the borders of the USA or UK, didnÂ´t build a rocket shield in Mexico, Canada or elsewhere at the borders of the USA. I read right now that Orban acts the same like Erdolf aka Erdogan. The last hungarian newspaper that reported about the criminal acts of the Orban family, the \"NÃ©pszabadsÃ¡g\" was closed down, freedom of the press is almost terminated now. And those EU puppets send taxmoney to such states and get nothing but problems back, but donÂ´t even try to stop such Hobby Hitlers. Good that Erdolfistan is not in the EU like hungaria and the other \"want revenge from russia\" liliputh states. And the people that elected Orban, just for anti-refugee and othe Nazi reasons, for nothing else? Another year under Orban and they will end as refugees in western europe! That will become embarrassing for the anti-refugee masses... To come to an end. ItÂ´s obvisiously the \"west\" who is playing foul, playing foul and nothing else than that, at least since 9/11. The anglo-american axis(the modern mass surveillance pioneers) is surrounding russia, not russia the \"west\"(and is using itÂ´s idiot european \"partners\" for this). ItÂ´s not russia that covers every part of the world with his military and his eavesdrop stations. ItÂ´s not russia that \"owns\" almost unsinkable aircraft carries like Germany(38.500 US troops in germany), for example. ItÂ´s not russia that stores nuke in germany, that we germans arenÂ´t even allowed to own or store on our territory. The NSA isnÂ´t russian. TTIP, CETA, NAFTA, TISA and all that, isnÂ´t russian. The bankster crash 2008 was not based in russia. The robber baron capitalism that \"feeds\" a few but exploits 99,9% is not coming from communism(though they learned fast how it works). Monsanto, Dupont etc, not russian. I could go on and on, but i have to come to an end.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russia\\\\\\'s Investigative Committee has launched a criminal case over the use of prohibited means and methods of war in connection with multiple bombardments of the Donetsk Region by Kiev\\\\\\'s forces and the National Guard, the IC\\\\\\'s acting spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said on Tuesday. \"On February 4-6 Ukrainian troops and national guardsmen carried out multiple artillery bombardments of the Donetsk Region. Dozens of apartment buildings and administrative offices, as well as power supply lines and railway rolling stock were damaged,\" she said. \"The IC\\\\\\'s department for the investigation of crimes involving the use of outlawed means and methods of warfare has opened a criminal case under part one of article 356 of the Criminal Code (The use of outlawed means and methods of war).   In violation of the Minsk Accords and the related ceasefire obligations, Petrenko said, the authorities in Kiev keep building up their military presence along the engagement line by bringing there reinforcements, including units of the 79th separate airborne assault brigade, the Donbass battalions and the Azov regiment. \"Few have doubts about the aims and results of such a military build-up. Since May 2014 the Investigative Committee has more than once reported progress in investigating grave and extremely grave crimes committed by Ukraine\\\\\\'s top political and military leadership in the territories of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions,\" Petrenko said. \"For the past three years civilians in these areas have been subjected to bombardments. Civilians are in the line of fire. Children are being killed and schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities ruined.\" Russian investigators have interpreted these actions as particularly grave crimes, as genocide, the use of outlawed means and methods of warfare, extremism, participation of mercenaries in an armed conflict or combat operations and kidnappings.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russia\\\\\\'s nuclear power corporation Rosatom was commissioned to create ammunition for Russia\\\\\\'s new heavy tracked platform-based tank Armata, the CEO of the tank\\\\\\'s designer and manufacturer Uralvagonzavod, Oleg Siyenko, has told TASS. \"We are in the process of test runs in the field and firing practice. We have done a great deal. Currently the focus is on firing practice and it depends on when we have the ammunition from our Rosatom subcontractors,\" Siyenko said.   He explained that the Rosatom had to be commissioned to this part of work because manufacturing ammunition implies certain specifics. \"It\\\\\\'s related with the caps. Rosatom said it could cope with that program for us. We sincerely help them,\" he said. The requirements to be met during the testing keep growing. \"It can go on and on like this without an end. We would like to deliver our products to the armed forces as soon as possible,\" Siyenko said. \"We hope that the army will start operating the new tanks next year at the latest, if not this year.\" In the middle of last year Uralvagonzavod deputy CEO Vyacheslav Khalitov said the Armata tanks will begin to be batch-produced in 2018.

Afghanistan expects oil import from Russia will grow, Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani said on Tuesday after talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. \"We discussed economic cooperation and trade relations. We focused on opportunities for Russian investments in Afghanistan,\" the minister said. \"In particular, we are interested in increasing oil import from Russia,\" Rabbani said. Russia is viewing an opportunity to supply 1-1.5 mln tonnes of oil products annually to Afghanistan, Deputy Energy Minister Yuri Sentyurin said last year.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Ukrainian forces keep moving heavy weapons and ammunition towards the line of disengagement in Donbass, Russian presidential envoy to Minsk talks on a settlement in the east of Ukraine, Boris Gryzlov, has said. \"From OSCE SMM reports and news from territories along the line of disengagement in Donbass we know that heavy weapons and ammunition continue to be massed up,\" he said. \"I would like to once again remind Ukraine\\\\\\'s leaders of the statement passed by the Contact Group on February 1, which calls on the parties to pull weapons falling under the Minsk agreements from the contact line to storage places by February 5,\" Gryzlov said.   \"This major provision of the statement has not yet been implemented by the Ukrainian armed forces,\" he stressed. Of particular worry, in his words, is mortar shelling of the Mayorsk checkpoint by Ukrainian troops in the evening on February 6. \"Luckily, no one was hurt. The incident only heightens our concern over security of people crossing the engagement line,\" he added. The situation along the line of contact in Donbass has deteriorated dramatically over the past few days. There are casualties among the civilian population due to the incessant shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, many dwelling houses and infrastructure facilities have been damaged. Thus, the Mayorsk checkpoint near Gorlovka came under mortar shelling by Ukrainian troops on Monday. In all, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\\\\\\'s Republic (DPR) reported more than 600 episodes of shelling by Ukrainian troops in the past day. On February 1, the Contact Group on the settlement in eastern Ukraine demanded at a meeting in Minsk an end to hostilities in Donbass and withdrawal of all weapons and equipment along the entire contact line to storage sites by February 5. However, according to the DPR command, Kiev has been pulling more weapons to the contact line instead of withdrawing them.\\'\\n \\'So privatization is really moving the CIA into private business , using E SYSTEMS TO RIP OGG  TAXPAYERS TO FEED THE CIA .

Georgia is ready to welcome Russia\\\\\\'s steps aimed at easing visa restrictions or even waiving visas, Georgia\\\\\\'s Special Representative for Relations with Russia, Zurab Abashidze told reporters in Czech Republic\\\\\\'s capital of Prague on Tuesday.   \"If Russia takes further steps to ease visa restrictions or even waive visas for Georgia\\\\\\'s citizens, we will welcome it, but we understand that it\\\\\\'s for the Russian authorities to decide,\" Abashidze added. He pointed out that in March 2012, Georgia had unilaterally waived visas for Russian nationals, while in early 2016, Russia had eased visa restrictions for Georgian citizens. On Tuesday, in Prague, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Karasin said that it was too early to speak about waiving visas for Georgia. \"Visas should not be expected to be waived soon, but we should work in this direction,\" the Russian diplomat said following his meeting with Abashidze. \"We are not against visa-free travel but we don\"t have diplomatic relations (with Georgia).\" \"Competent agencies should thoroughly discuss all the measures related to the two countries\"?security,\" Karasin added. On December 23, 2016, during his annual news conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow could grant visa waiver for Georgia. \"I don\"t rule out that visas for Georgian citizens could be waived. I think such decision would be reasonable partly because we see that Georgia\\\\\\'s authorities have been sending some positive signals,\" the Russian president added.   \"It is very important that secret services and law enforcement agencies establish normal contacts between them in order to cooperate in combating terrorism, so we need to be sure that visa waiver will not damage our security,\" Putin said. \"I think it is possible.\" Russia introduced visas for Georgia in 2000, later Georgia took a similar decision. In 2004, Georgia unilaterally eased visa restrictions for Russian citizens who received an opportunity to obtain one-to three-month visas upon their arrival in the country. In 2011, Georgia granted visa-free entry for a period of up to 90 days for Russian citizens residing in North Caucasus republics and entering the country via the Kazbegi checkpoint. In March 2012, Georgia waived visas for Russian nationals.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/.

The next Winter Olympics, which are XXIII Winter Olympic Games, will take place in South Korea\\\\\\'s PyeongChang on February 9-25, 2018.

And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press does not want to report it.\" Trump did not specify any particular incidents that had been omitted from coverage. \"They [the press] have their reasons, and you understand that,\" he said. During a subsequent press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared to double down on the president\\\\\\'s claim, saying there were several instances of the media under-reporting terrorist attacks. \"There\\\\\\'s a lot of instances that have occurred where I don\\\\\\'t think they\\\\\\'ve gotten the coverage it\\\\\\'s deserved and I think that\\\\\\'s what the president was clearly referring to there,\" Spicer said. Spicer did not offer any specific examples at the time, but said he believed that while some attacks or foiled attacks \"barely [get] coverage,\" extensive reporting has been done on some protests against the Trump administration. Included in a list of attacks that the White House provided Monday evening were the Paris attacks in November 2015, San Bernardino, in December 2015, Brussels in March 2016 and Nice, France in July 2016. Those incidents, each with multiple casualties, were among dozens of attacks the White House listed between September 2014 and December 2016. \"The point here is that these terrorist attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,\" a White House spokesperson said. During his brief remarks at the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, the president seemed to make reference to his executive order banning immigration and visas from seven Muslim-majority nations that is currently the subject of a number of legal challenges. \"We need strong programs,\" he said, adding that \"people that want to destroy us and want to destroy our country\" must be kept out. Trump went on to defend NATO while simultaneously saying members of the alliance were not making \"full and proper contributions.\" Echoing President Ronald Reagan, Trump said the U.S. military should be guided by the mantra \"Peace Through Strength,\" before repeating his campaign refrain \"America First.\" \\'\\n \\'CHITA, February 7. /TASS/.

A total of 4,608 terrorist facilities have been destroyed since January 1,\" the general said. Over the past month, the Syrian government troops have driven terrorists out of 35 communities in the north of the province of Aleppo, he said.   \"Control of a territory of over 300 square kilometers has been established. The government troops are currently 1.5 kilometers south of the town of al-Bab, the general said. Joint actions by Russian Aerospace Force and Turkey\\\\\\'s Air Force are making a considerable contribution to destroying the IS grouping, he noted. \"For this purpose, they are maintaining constant interaction and exchanging information, as well as doing joint planning and delivering strikes. The Russian warplanes have destroyed 892 terrorist objectives near al-Bab,\" the Russian general said. According to Rudskoi, Russia\\\\\\'s Tu-22M3 long-range bombers have carried out 36 combat flights to Syria\\\\\\'s city of Deir ez-Zor since the beginning of the year, destroying 34 facilities of the Islamic State. \"The airstrikes of Russia\\\\\\'s long-range bombers in the city of Deir ez-Zor area have played an important role in eroding the combat capabilities and morale of the ISIL militants. The Tu-22M3 bombers have carried out 36 combat flights destroying as many as 34 terrorist facilities. Russia\\\\\\'s Aerospace Force will continue its activities aimed at eliminating terrorist facilities on Syria\\\\\\'s territory,\" the general added. On January 18, Russia\\\\\\'s General Staff said that the Islamic State militants \"continue to attack the positions of the Syrian troops. In case the city is taken by terrorists, the residents will face a true genocide. The population of Deir ez-Zor may be exterminated.\" After that, Russia has more than once used its long-range bombers to deliver airstrikes in the Deir ez-Zor province.  \\'\\n \\'Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government.

Sanctions will not force North Korea to abandon its missile and nuclear program and the solution to this issue may be only achieved through talks, Russia\\\\\\'s Ambassador to South Korea Alexander Timonin said in an interview with TASS. \"The Russian side does not share the extremely tough approach of the US and its regional allies towards North Korea,\" the ambassador said. \"It is clear for us that it is wrong to expect that the sanctions and pressure will sooner or later lead to North Korea\\\\\\'s breakdown or force the country\\\\\\'s leadership to make serious concessions on the principal issues.\"   \"We believe that the only solution to the nuclear and other issues of the Korean Peninsula is to continue political and diplomatic efforts with the goal of returning North Korea to the six-party talks,\" he said. \"In a broader international context, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should be carried out in the framework of the overall military and political detente in Northeast Asia, reducing the level of military confrontation and forming the basis for mutual confidence between the regional states.\" \"Russia, just as South Korea, does not accept North Korea\\\\\\'s self-proclaimed nuclear status,\" he said. \"We are confident that the policy aimed at boosting the nuclear missile capacity is not conducive to ensuring Pyongyang\\\\\\'s security and can lead to further aggravation of the situation on the Korean Peninsula and irreparable consequences for the situation in the region as a whole.\" \"Relying on these considerations, the Russian side supported UN Security Council Resolutions 2270 and 2321 passed in 2016 over nuclear missile tests in the North and has consistently complied with the provisions of these documents,\" the diplomat said.   Timonin noted that Russia does not share the excessively tough approach towards North Korea by the US and its regional allies. \"For us it is obvious that hopes that sanctions and pressure will sooner or later trigger North Korea\\\\\\'s collapse or force top officials in that country to make serious concessions on key issues are futile,\" he went on to say. \"We adhere to an opinion that the only way of tackling the nuclear and other issues of the Korean Peninsula is the continuation of political and diplomatic efforts with a view to returning North Korea to the six-party negotiating table.\" The ambassador added that the final denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula \"must be carried out within the framework of the overall easing of tensions in the military and political sphere in Northeast Asia, reducing the level of military confrontation and laying the foundation for mutual trust between the countries in the region.\"\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. The deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea continues Washington\\\\\\'s policy of creating a missile defense segment in Northeast Asia and thereby poses a threat to Russia, Russia\\\\\\'s ambassador to Seoul, Aleksandr Timonin, told TASS in an interview. \"The decision to deploy US THAAD missile systems in South Korean territory remains Russia\\\\\\'s major concern,\" he said. \"We are being told these US missile systems are purely defensive and meant for warding off missile threats coming from North Korea.\" Timonin said Russia had a wider vision of this issue.   \"We regard this as further efforts by Washington to create a new regional segment of the United States\"?global missile defense in Northeast Asia near the Russian border,\" he said. \"This is a direct threat to the security of our country, because the main aim of the US global missile defense is to minimize the effectiveness of Russia\\\\\\'s missile potential.\" Timonin said the Republic of Korea as a sovereign state was free to decide how to go about the business of ensuring its national security. \"Nevertheless, we believe that the deployment of THAAD batteries in South Korea obviously goes beyond the bounds of tasks of deterring a \"\\\\x98North Korean\"?threat - real or imaginary,\" he said. \"This step may upset the strategic balance and harm our systematic efforts for enhancing relations of mutual trust, partnership and cooperation in the region of Northeast Asia.\" Timonin recalled that Russia urged \"collective search for a new, constructive strategy of exit from the critical situation in the Korean Peninsula and insisted on a peace and diplomatic settlement of the peninsula\\\\\\'s nuclear problem.\" This year\\\\\\'s schedule of high-level contacts between Moscow and Seoul is under consideration, it very much depends on the current political situation in South Korea, Timonin said in an interview with TASS. While responding to a question when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov could visit Seoul, he said that \"we are content with intensive high-level political contacts between our countries.\" \"We hope that bilateral political dialogue will remain active this year,\" the Russian ambassador added. According to him, \"the schedule for contacts between the two foreign ministries in 2017 is currently under consideration. It will be agreed on depending on the political situation in South Korea.\"   The diplomat pointed out that in March 2016, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich had held talks with South Korea\\\\\\'s Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia. In April 2016, Moscow hosted a meeting of the parliament speakers of Eurasian countries, arranged for the first time upon the initiative of Russia\\\\\\'s State Duma (lower house of parliament) speaker and the speaker of South Korea\\\\\\'s National Assembly. In May 2016, Chief of South Korea\\\\\\'s Constitutional Court Park Han-Chul visited Russia to take part in the Fourth St. Petersburg International Legal Forum. \"The foreign ministers of Russia and South Korea met three times last year: on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in February, during a meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia held in Beijing in April, and in June, when the South Korean top diplomat visited Russia,\" Timonin added. Implementation of large-scale investment projects in Siberia and the Far East with participation of Korean business will make bilateral economic ties more active, Timonin said.   \"From our point of view, implementation of large-scale joint investment projects in regions of Siberia and the Far East and creation of new production facilities with proactive use of advantages for foreign business within the framework of advance development territories (ADT) and Vladivostok Free Port can promote expansion of bilateral economic ties,\" the ambassador said. Companies from South Korea-may take part in setup of new high-technology production facilities in Russia\\\\\\'s Far East, Timonin said. \"More active efforts on creation of investment and finance platforms are undertaken for solution of this task,\" the ambassador said.

When asked whether the Russian authorities\"?attitude towards this TV network could change, Peskov emphasized that Kremlin is guided \"strictly by provisions of the media law, which is in effect in our country.\" \"We have the same attitude towards both domestic - federal and regional - and international media,\" he said. \"Anyway, this is an insult. First, a media correspondent utters it. Then the media\\\\\\'s editors prefer to keep quiet about it. Of course, this does little credit to this media outlet,\" Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman noted that it is possible to wait for apologies from Bill O¡¯Reilly  in 2023 for his insulting remarks about the Russian leader. \"We have a different understanding of good manners and etiquette with this gentleman,\" he said commenting the journalist\\\\\\'s statement that he may apologize for his words in 2023. \"We are very kind and very patient.

Kucherena is certain that US President Donald Trump will make the correct decision regarding Snowden. \"We all hope that the United States\"?new president will take a balanced approach to this matter and make the sole decision that is correct - to terminate criminal prosecution of Edward Snowden, a man who loves America and misses it.\" \"The way I see it, he [Donald Trump - TASS]-would gain far more authority if he saw to it all insinuations about Edward Snowden were brought to an end,\" Kucherena stated, adding that throughout the Obama presidency the case remained invariably politicized. Snowden should decide himself whether he needs to get Russian citizenship, Kucherena stressed:   \"Under the existing Russian legislation, if he wishes so, he can apply for getting the citizenship after the elapse of five years. So far, this term has not yet expired and it is premature to speak about this. This issue is within his competence and precisely he will decide on whether to extend his residence permit or raise the issue of obtaining the Russian citizenship,\" the lawyer said.- Snowden, a civil employee of the National Security Agency, in 2013 disclosed electronic spying methods being used by US secret services, including the tapping of telephones of foreign leaders. In his attempts to escape persecution by the US authorities Snowden asked more than 20 countries, including Russia, for political asylum. On August 1, 2014 he was granted a residence permit and has remained in Russian territory since. In the United States Snowden is charged under two articles of the spying law.

Dan Patrick, who said he asked the Texas Rangers to help the Houston Police look for it. \"Tom Brady\\\\\\'s jersey has great historical value and is already being called \\\\\\'the most valuable NFL collectible ever,\" Patrick said in a statement. \"It will likely go into the Hall of Fame one day. It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas. I\"ve called Colonel Steve McCraw to ask that the Texas Rangers work with the Houston Police Department on this case.\" \"I\\\\\\'m a Texans and Cowboys fan first,\" Patrick said, \"but the unquestionable success of the Super Bowl in Houston last night was a big win for our entire state and I don\"t want anything to mar that victory. Whoever took this jersey should turn it in. The Texas Rangers are on the trail.\" The intrigue surrounding Brady\\\\\\'s missing jersey began last night after the Patriots\\\\\\' historic win, when Brady was seen on video telling Patriots owner Robert Kraft that his game jersey was stolen. The Patriots said Brady\\\\\\'s jersey and pads were taken off the field before the trophy ceremony Sunday night, Boston station FOX25 reported Monday morning; it appears the jersey disappeared at some point after that. This clarified an earlier Fox25 report that a team equipment manager had locked the jersey up. This morning, Brady told reporters he is still missing the jersey, saying he put it in his bag Sunday night and later it was gone. \"If it shows up on eBay somewhere, someone let me know,\" Brady said this morning. \"It\\\\\\'s unfortunate, because that\\\\\\'s a nice piece of memorabilia,\" Brady said. \"Those are pretty special ones to keep ... What can you do? I\\\\\\'ll take the ring and that\\\\\\'s good enough for me.\" Brady, who was named Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl for the fourth time, accepted the MVP trophy from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell with smiles at the press conference this morning.   Goodell had suspended Brady for the first four games of the 2016 season for his alleged involvement in the deflation of footballs during the 2015 AFC championship game. Last night marked the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history as the Patriots erased a 25-point deficit, beating the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime. It was also a record fifth Super Bowl win for Brady. Brady said at a press conference this morning of the Falcons, \"I give them a lot of credit. They\\\\\\'re a great football team.\"     \"It took a lot of great plays for us to overcome the deficit and the hole that we dug. But we were able to do it,\" Brady said. Brady said the Patriots \"faced a lot of adversities\" this year and he called their stunning victory a \"great way to really culminate the season.\" \"It took a kind of miraculous effort to do it,\" he said, adding that he\\\\\\'s \"happy that we were able to get it accomplished.\"       Brady said \"it was great\" to celebrate at the Super Bowl with his mother, who has been ill and missed all of this season\\\\\\'s games. \"She\\\\\\'s been through a lot. Way harder than what I went through last night ... and my dad\\\\\\'s been there every step of the way. They set such a great example for me,\" Brady said. Now that the big game is over, Brady said he\\\\\\'s looking to spending time with his children, who he said will be happy to see the trophy.  \\'\\n \\'Russia\\\\\\'s dependence on imported oil and gas equipment has dropped to 53% today, Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said at a meeting of the United Russia faction. \"We expected to reduce dependence on import to 60% this year. In fact, we have already exceeded this level: the share of Russian equipment purchased by our companies is more than 53%,\" the minister said. According to him, in 2014, the Industry and Trade Ministry and Energy Ministry set up a special interdepartmental commission for this purpose and the results of its work are seen today.  \\'\\n \\'CAIRO, February 7. /TASS/. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has officially described the crash of the Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula in October 2015 as a terrorist attack, Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said on Tuesday in response to a list of 78 terrorist attacks, which did not get sufficient media coverage, released by the White House.   Commenting on critical remarks by US President, Donald Trump, who accused US media of covering up terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere by not reporting them, the Egyptian diplomat noted that 9 out of 78 attacks occurred in Egypt. \"Terrorist operations have killed dozens or even hundreds of people, including the crash of the Russian airliner in Sinai and the explosion of the al-Butrusia Coptic Church,\" he said. \"It is regrettable that the selectivity and bias criticized by Trump apply to the some Western media\\\\\\'s approach towards covering terrorist attacks.\" Egypt previously did not reject the version of a terror attack on board the Russian plane that crashed on October 31, 2015. However, Cairo has always pointed to the need to wait for the official results of the probe, which have not been made public to date. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stressed that work at all stages of the investigation was conducted proceeding from the assumption that the air crash was a deliberate act. \"The White House\\\\\\'s stance is in line with Egypt\\\\\\'s repeated calls on the need for comprehensive, consistent and unselective counterterrorism strategy, including in its political, information and cultural aspects,\" the spokesman noted.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/ The law of non-decrease of entropy in closed systems, which is one of the formulations of the second law of thermodynamics, can be broken, said the press service of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). An international team of scientists under the guidance of Gordey Lesovik, Chief Researcher at MIPT\\\\\\'s Laboratory of Quantum Theory of Information and the L. D. Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences discovered that entropy can decrease in quantum systems. The results of the study have been published in the journal Scientific Reports from the Nature publishing group. \"We have discovered Maxwell\\\\\\'s demon which can reduce the entropy in the system,\" Lesovik said. Maxwell\\\\\\'s demon is a mythic creature invented by British physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the second half of the 19th century in order to explain the paradox of the second law of thermodynamics. The demon should increase the orderliness of a system which by itself cannot grow in the isolated system according to the laws of physics. In the 1870s, Ludwig Boltzmann formulated the principle of growth of entropy (disorder) in his H-theorem which postulated that the value of entropy in a closed system can only increase or remain constant. For a long time, this theorem could not be proven in the framework of traditional statistical physics without additional restrictions. After establishing quantum mechanics, scientists suggested that the H-theorem was rooted in the quantum world. In the quantum theory of information, the important results were obtained which describe conditions when the entropy of a system does not diminish.   The group led by Lesovik first formulated the H-theorem in the language of quantum physics and for several years had tried to find proof of that theorem. As a result, the researchers uncovered conditions when the second law of thermodynamics can be locally breached. This can happen in quantum systems of relatively small but macroscopic size measuring a few centimeters or even meters. The notable difference between the classical and quantum approach is that in classical physics, the decrease of entropy is connected to the transmission of heat energy while in the quantum world, the reduction of entropy can take place without energy transfer but due to quantum entanglement. According to Lesovik, the researchers are planning to perform experiments in the near future to verify the effect. Such experiments will open the door to creating a new type of quantum coolers and power generators.-  \\'\\n \\'- Russia and Iran have a common objective in Syria, and all assertions about the possibility of driving a wedge between the two countries are speculations, Vedomosti quotes former Russian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Andrei Baklanov, as saying. \"We have substantially coinciding stances with Tehran. Bashar al-Assad\\\\\\'s regime is legitimate and should be preserved, while Syria\\\\\\'s future must be determined by the people of the country. As for Iran, Trump currently has other priorities or just does not have enough hard facts,\" the diplomat stressed.   The Wall Street Journal earlier reported, citing high-ranking sources in the White House, Europe and some Arab countries, that the Trump administration is searching for ways of destroying the military and diplomatic alliance between Russia and Iran to accelerate the end of the conflict in Syria and step up the fight against the Islamic State (terrorist group, outlawed in Russia). The US will be unable to influence the Russia-Iran alliance directly, according to Vladimir Yevseyev, Deputy Director of the CIS Countries Institute. In his view, Washington can create problems indirectly, primarily by hampering the work of Russian businesses in Iran through new sanctions against Tehran or strengthening the existing ones. Discord in the Russia-Turkey-Iran troika in Syria is possible as well, and Moscow should prevent this from happening, the expert went on to say. \"The possible weak points are demands for Tehran to stop arms supplies to Hezbollah via Syria and the withdrawal of Revolutionary Guards advisers from that country. If that happens, Iran\\\\\\'s role in Syria will diminish substantially, which make combat operations more difficult, while Iran will get the impression that it has been excluded from the process. In that case, it may turn against Russia.\" - Moscow and Tbilisi will hold another round of consultations on mending bilateral relations in Prague on Tuesday. As usual, Russia is represented at the talks by Deputy Foreign Minister, Grigory Karasin, and Georgia - by Special Representative for Relations with Russia, Zurab Abashidze. Georgia has been doing its utmost in terms of abolishing visas for Russians and citizens of other countries, Abashidze told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"We have cancelled visa restrictions for Russian nationals,\" he said. \"They may stay in Georgia without visas for up to a year. For its part, Russia simplified visa requirements for Georgian citizens, which affected the number of issued visas. We heard the Russian president\\\\\\'s remarks about the possibility of abolishing visas. If Russia pushes ahead with its efforts in terms of simplifying requirements or abolishing visas, we will see that as a step in the right decision, which would be praised. The visa issue is Russia\\\\\\'s domain. If there are new proposals on this matter, we will hear them out and discuss them. When asked about the prospects for restoring diplomatic relations between Moscow and Tbilisi, Abashidze emphasized that that \"the issue will not be on the agenda as long as Georgia\\\\\\'s territorial integrity is violated.\" \"However, if the process of resolving the problems related to Abkhazia and South Ossetia begins, if significant progress is made, restoration of diplomatic relations could be included in the agenda at some point,\" he emphasized. - Russia\\\\\\'s Federal National Guard Troops Service will monitor rallies, concerts and football matches by using airships, Izvestia writes. These high-altitude reconnaissance devices equipped with cutting-edge optics will be able to pinpoint specific pockets of unrest, especially rabble-rousers and isolate them without endangering other people\\\\\\'s lives and wellbeing.   They could be used for the first time during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup scheduled to be held in Russia this summer. A source in the Russian National Guard informed TASS that the use of aerial monitoring systems is a new direction in developing weapons for Russia\\\\\\'s National Guard Troops. \"As a rule, there is a small group of troublemakers who revel in sparking destructive activity. They are behind the masses of people who take to the streets,\" Sergey Melikov, First Deputy Director of the Russian National Guard, explained in an interview with the paper. \"Therefore, we need to localize such offenders and detain the instigators. We ensure people\\\\\\'s safety, first and foremost. We see our mission as preventing adverse conditions where mass discontent may escalate into mass civil disobedience.\" Meanwhile, Vsevolod Alexeyev, Chairman of the Society for Consumer Right\\\\\\'s Protection in Sports, told the paper that the proposed move could be of considerable help in ensuring security during the Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup. \"It is clear that security requirements during the World Cup and the Confederations Cup in Russia will be very stringent, and the task of all services involved is to minimize possible incidents. If aerial monitoring makes it possible to identify specific individuals who break the law, this will significantly contribute to ensuring security.\" - Moldova\\\\\\'s President, Igor Dodon, will soon start negotiations with other representatives of the Moldovan authorities on Transnistria and the presence of Russian peacekeepers there, presidential adviser for Transnistria, Vasile Sova, informed Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Prime Minister Pavel Filip earlier asked the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to again consider the issue of \"the illegal presence of Russian troops,\" including peacekeepers, in Moldova. According to Sova, Russian peacekeepers were deployed to that country under the 1992 agreement, which has a substantial legal base, which means that there are no grounds to question their presence. However, they could be replaced as part of the \"5+2\" international negotiation framework (Moldova and Transnistria as parties, Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE as mediators, and EU and the US as observers). Negotiations within this framework were frozen for several years. After the arrival of President Igor Dodon, a glimmer of hope appeared that they could be revived. Dodon was the first president who travelled to Tiraspol to meet with new Transnistria leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky, and struck a deal on regular meetings with him, the paper notes. \"The ruling coalition in Moldova never achieved any positive results during its negotiations with Transnistria,\" Irina Vlah, head of Moldova\\\\\\'s Gagauz autonomy, told the paper. \"But then Dodon appeared who is prepared for talks with Transnistria at any level. Dialogue is necessary, but there is no need to hurry,\" she said. - The latest wave of arrests in Turkey is not only part of a counter-terrorism campaign but also part of the preparations for the referendum on a new draft Constitution, which envisages transitioning the country from a parliamentary to a presidential republic, a source close to diplomatic circles in Ankara told Izvestia.   \"The vote is expected to be held in April,\" the source said. \"Meanwhile, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, needs to tackle two problems, namely, the economic crisis and rampant terrorism. This will make it possible for him to get the required support from the Turkish population. So, the recent arrests should be seen from this perspective as well.\" According to the latest data, Turkish security forces have arrested nearly 800 people suspected of having links to the Islamic State (terrorist group, outlawed in Russia). Igor Morozov, member of Russia\\\\\\'s Federation Council (upper house of parliament) International Affairs Committee, said in an interview with the paper that this is further evidence of Ankara\\\\\\'s change in attitude towards those forces, which the Turkish leadership previously had turned a blind eye to. \"Turkey\\\\\\'s stance on the Islamic State has changed significantly. Erdogan saw that members of this group carry out terrorist attacks against Turkish officials. Very often, militants are a tool in the hands of the opponents of the Turkish president,\" Morozov explained. The senator added that the large-scale arrests can be seen negatively in Turkish society too, since many of Erdogan\\\\\\'s political opponents have been detained as well. - TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the-press reviews\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Moscow wants to cooperate with Kabul in a range of areas, especially in security and economy, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday opening talks with his Afghan counterpart Salahuddin Rabbani. \"Russia and Afghanistan are old-time and close partners, and are interested in cooperation in security, humanitarian and economic areas,\" Lavrov said. \"We support efforts of Afghanistan\\\\\\'s leadership in stabilizing the situation in the country and in the war on terror.\" Moscow is satisfied by the \"level of political dialogue\" with Afghanistan and cooperation in the United Nations, Russia\\\\\\'s top diplomat said.   Lavrov expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the avalanches in Afghanistan earlier this month, wishing a speedy recovery to the injured people. More than 100 people died in this tragedy between February 4 and 6. Lavrov called on Afghanistan to develop cooperation in preparing for natural disasters. Rabbani thanked Lavrov for offering condolences, noting that Afghanistan\\\\\\'s authorities are making every effort to reduce the aftermath of the disaster. \"This trip is important, we call for developing our relations. We have many topics for discussion, in particular, the fight against terrorism,\" Afghanistan\\\\\\'s foreign minister said. Russia and Afghanistan have established a close dialog between their special services to identify and eliminate terrorist groups, Lavrov said following talks with his Afghan counterpart. \"The anti-terror cooperation is an important topic and an element of our bilateral relationships,\" the minister said. \"We have an inter-governmental agreement on Russia\\\\\\'s military and technical assistance to Afghanistan. It has sealed the practice that has existed for already many years and practically helps to raise the combat potential of Afghanistan\\\\\\'s security services and the Afghan national army,\" Russia\\\\\\'s top diplomat said. \"Now we have an agreement and so the legal framework has been strengthened; it entered into force in November last year,\" the foreign minister said. Russia is prepared to continue providing assistance to Afghanistan in supplying and repairing military equipment, Lavrov said. \"The Russian side has confirmed its willingness to continue providing assistance to Afghanistan in supplying and repairing military equipment,\" the minister said. \"We have the appropriate capabilities and the appropriate agreements. We will also help training national personnel of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, both in military and civilian occupations.\"   The international meeting on Afghanistan with participation of Russia, Pakistan, China, Iran and India will be held in Moscow in mid-February, -Lavrov said. \"We have a common understanding that there is the need to boost efforts (for reconciliation in Afghanistan). In this context, we confirmed the invitation for the Afghan colleagues for another meeting on Afghanistan\\\\\\'s settlement due in mid-February in Moscow, with participation of representatives of Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Iran and India,\" Lavrov said. \"We expect that all partners will be represented at a high level, and most of them have already confirmed their participation,\" he said. Russia\\\\\\'s supports Afghanistan\\\\\\'s bid for full-fledged membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), according to Lavrov. \"We confirmed our support for the development of cooperation in assisting the Afghan settlement as part of the SCO, considering that this year India and Pakistan will join the SCO as full-format members and considering that Kabul filed a similar application in 2015 for full-fledged membership, a bid, which the Russian Federation supports,\" Lavrov said. Russia will continue working in favor of the approval of this application by all the SCO members, Russia\\\\\\'s top diplomat said. Moscow is prepared to establish contacts with the United States on Afghanistan and this will be to the benefit of everyone, first of all the Afghan people, Lavrov said. According to Lavrov, Russia maintained some contacts on Afghanistan with the previous US administration but they were \"sporadic\" and lacked confidence.   Russia\\\\\\'s top diplomat said he is convinced that Russia and the US will establish \"partner cooperation\" taking into consideration that US President Donald Trump confirmed that the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group is a top priority in the international affairs. \"As soon as the structures are formed in Washington, which will deal with the war on terror and the Afghan issue in broader terms, both in the State Department, the White House and other bodies of the US administration, I\\\\\\'m sure that our contacts will be established,\" Lavrov said. \"This will be to the benefit of everyone, including our Afghan friends,\" he said. The Russian diplomat also said that Russia supports the idea of plugging the Taliban into a dialog over future settlement in Afghanistan on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions. \"We have confirmed our common stance that-Taliban should be involved in a constructive dialog in keeping with the criteria contained in the UN Security Council resolutions,\" Lavrov said. Lavrov said the Taliban was trying \"to conduct the dialog on certain terms that do not quite suit our Afghan counterparts and in a situation where the Islamic State (terrorist organization outlawed in Russia), has been trying to get a foothold in Afghanistan.\"\\'\\n \\'YAROSLAVL, February 7. /TASS/. Russian adventurer Fyodor Konyukhov and his companion, certified balloonist, holder of the \"master of sports\" title Ivan Menyailo have left an airdrome near Rybinsk, the Yaroslavl Region, by a hot air balloon hoping to stay in the air for more than 50 hours, thereby setting a new non-stop flight world record, the adventurer\\\\\\'s son, Oskar Konyukhov, has told TASS. \"At 09:04 Moscow time the balloon took off and has since remained at an altitude of 50-60 meters. It is moving southwest, towards Moscow. The launch has taken place and this is most important,\" said Konyukhov Jr. For setting a new non-stop flight world record lasting more than 50 hours the adventurers are expected to avoid crossing air borders with other countries, because the wind may carry the balloon towards Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania. In that case the crew will have to land. Likewise the ambitious attempt will have to be terminated if the balloon ventures into Moscow\\\\\\'s airspace or if there is heavy snowfall.   Oskar Konyukhov said strong wind delayed the flight by two hours, but Konyukhov\\\\\\'s support team eventually managed to load the gondola with extra 75 fuel cylinders. \"The wind was strong. Originally the balloon was due to leave at seven in the morning. We had to wait for two hours for the wind to subside somewhat. We managed to bring extra fuel cylinders on board,\" Oskar Konyukhov said. Previously, the flight was scheduled for the middle of January only to have been postponed due to a thaw. Clear skies and frosty weather, with air temperatures staying at 15-20 degrees below freezing are the key factors for success. The local authorities will arrange festivities on the occasion of the record-setting attempt. Konyukhov has dedicated the flight to an Orthodox Saint, Admiral Fyodor Ushakov, who was born in the Rybinsk district of the Yaroslavl Region. Konyukhov set the previous non-stop flight record on a hot air balloon in January 2016 over the Tula, Moscow, Ryazan, Vladimir and Ivanovo regions. He stayed in the air for 32 hours and 20 minutes.

Director of Russia\\\\\\'s State Historical Museum Alexei Levykin has told TASS he opposes the handover of St. Isaac\\\\\\'s Cathedral, one of St. Petersburg\\\\\\'s prominent landmarks and a UNESCO World Heritage site, to the Russian Orthodox Church.  Saint Isaac\\\\\\'s: The iconic St. Petersburg cathedral  Currently, there are many opportunities for successful cooperation of museums and the church, he stressed. \"Still, I\\\\\\'m a representative of the museum community and a member of the Russian presidium of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and a member of the presidium of the Union of Museums of Russia, and my stance here is that I do not welcome the handover of St. Isaac\\\\\\'s Cathedral. I believe that there are much more opportunities for joint successful cooperation of museums and the church that complement each other,\" he said in an interview with TASS. The church and the museum community have joint tasks of \"preserving spirituality, morality, high moral and cultural values,\" Levykin said. \"We should not forget that the museum personnel preserved the church values in the extreme conditions during the post-revolutionary and the war time, sometimes at the expense of their own life,\" he said.   During the Soviet time, the State Historical Museum in Moscow incorporated the Krutitsy Metochion, containing historic buildings erected in the late 17th century, and the Novodevichy Convent, a UNESCO world heritage site and burial place of many famous figures. These two sites were handed over to the Orthodox Church some 20 years ago and in 2010, respectively. Saint Basil\\\\\\'s Cathedral, one of symbols of Russia and a major tourist attraction, which became part of the Historical Museum in 1928, has been jointly managed by the museum and the Orthodox Church for a quarter of a century already. Every Sunday and twice a year worship service is held in the cathedral. During this time, the access of tourists is limited to create convenient conditions for the believers. The plans by the St. Petersburg government to hand over St. Isaac\\\\\\'s Cathedral to the Orthodox Church have stirred up a lot of public controversy. The announcement was followed by protests throughout the city. More than 200,000 people have signed a petition against the handover of the cathedral, one of Russia\\\\\\'s most popular museums visited by some 3.5 mln tourists annually. Mikhail Piotrovsky, Director of the State Hermitage Museum, has asked Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill to revoke the handover request to stop public protests. The cathedral was built in 1818-1858 and transformed into a museum after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Church services were resumed at St. Isaac\\\\\\'s in 1990. However, St. Isaac\\\\\\'s was not property of the Orthodox Church even prior to the revolution since its maintenance was very expensive. The cathedral was managed by the Imperial Ministry of Communication Routes and Public Buildings until 1871 and was then turned over to the Interior Ministry of the Russian Empire.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russia still expects Belarus to repay its gas debt, though there is no progress in the talks on issues related to gas and oil between the two countries, Russia\\\\\\'s Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said Tuesday. \"So far there is no progress. We\\\\\\'r expecting our colleagues to make suggestions. There are no agreements between us based on previous proposals. But in any case we\\\\\\'r expecting repayment for 2016,\" he said.   Earlier Dvorkovich said that Belarus\\\\\\' debt for Russian gas supplies had reached around $550 mln as of January 28. Belarus and Russia have been negotiating a reduction in gas prices since early 2016. Minsk insisted on lowering the price of Russian natural gas from $132 to $73 per 1,000 cubic meters and demanded that Russia switch to equal netback pricing. In response to underpayment of around $300 mln for Russian gas supplies Moscow cut its tax-free oil supplies to Belarus by more than a third. In end-2016, Belarus transferred an advance payment for Russian gas and expressed the hope that the volume of oil supplies would be restored. However, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said that Russia had returned the advance payment and insisted on full execution of the gas contract. At the same time, Dvorkovich did not rule out that the settlement of the gas dispute with Belarus could be resolved in court.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russia\\\\\\'s GDP dynamics (seasonally adjusted) turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Central Bank reported Tuesday. \"In the fourth quarter of 2016, the annual rate of gain in production was estimated as positive, which is highlighted by the dynamics of forward-looking indicator of output of products and services on the main types of economic activity. The quarterly GDP growth rate (seasonally adjusted) is estimated to turn positive, demonstrating a revival of economic activity, which will persist in early 2017 as well,\" the report said.   Meanwhile, the recovery in cumulative demand in the first half of 2017 will spur Russia\\\\\\'s economic growth further on, the Bank of Russia said. \"In the fourth quarter of 2016, the economic recovery started to get sustainable, though the dynamics of the main indicators remained mixed. On the one hand, industrial production increased, backed by surging external demand and expansion of import substitution. The investment activity gradually rebounded,\" the report said. On the other hand, the consumer demand shrank following a slight growth in the third quarter of 2016, the regulator said. \"In the fourth quarter, seasonally adjusted GDP turned positive, according to the Bank of Russia. In 2016, GDP reduction amounted to 0.2%. A recovery of cumulative demand in the first half of 2017 will facilitate further GDP growth,\" the Central Bank said. According to the Economic Development Ministry\\\\\\'s official outlook for 2017, Russia\\\\\\'s GDP growth will be 0.6%. However, Economic Development Minister said earlier that GDP growth would exceed 2% in the second half of this year, meaning that 1H 2017 GDP growth will be above 1%. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia\\\\\\'s GDP growth may be around 1-1.2% this year.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. A snap check of the Russian Aerospace Forces has begun on Tuesday morning by decision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian Defense Minister, Sergey Shoigu, said.   \"In accordance with the decision by the Armed Forces Supreme Commander, a snap check of the Aerospace Forces began to evaluate readiness of the control agencies and troops to carry out combat training tasks,\" he said.According to Shoigu, the control agencies and military units started measures to enhance combat readiness at 09:00 Moscow Time. - \"Special attention should be paid to combat alert, deployment of air defense systems for a time of war and air groupings\"?readiness to repel the aggression,\" Shoigu added. He also ordered to ensure strict compliance with the safety requirements and undamaged condition of weapons and ammunition.

And they cannot be dealt with on friendly terms.\"?Her husband, 35-year-old Vladimir Kara-Murza, an outspoken critic of Putin, remains in critical condition, fighting for his life, she said. His doctors say he was poisoned by an unknown substance, she added. The activist was hospitalized on Thursday shortly after feeling ill; within hours, most of his major organs were failing. It is the second time in two years that he was poisoned; the first time, in 2015, left the father of three with nerve damage that left him walking with cane. Evgenia Kara-Murza said that she does not know who is behind the poisoning but that she believes it can only be related to his work. A veteran opposition campaigner, he has appeared repeatedly before the U.S. Congress, pressing for it to impose sanctions on Russian officials involved in human rights abuse.

The actual danger that Russia\\\\\\'s embassy in Damascus may come under attack is not decreasing even amid the ceasefire deal between the Syrian government and the opposition, Russian Ambassador to Syria Alexander Kinshchak said in an interview with TASS. \"The establishment of ceasefire on December 30, 2016 had a positive impact on the military and political situation in Syria in general,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, this does not mean that the security situation of the embassy has automatically improved.\"   It\\\\\\'s no secret that not only terrorists of the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra (outlawed in Russia) but also some other \"irreconcilable\" Jihadist groups call against peaceful settlement in Syria and for continuing the armed struggle until the regime of Bashar Assad is toppled, he said. These armed gangs do not recognize the ceasefire agreement and try to disrupt it by all means, \"including through attempts to stage high-profile terrorist attacks against Russia\\\\\\'s representatives in Syria,\" Kinshchak said. \"By the way, the Army of Islam [Jaysh al-Islam] is just one of the groups responsible for the shellings of Damascus,\" the ambassador said. \"This was also done by the Nusra members dug in Jobar and Eastern Ghouta, their former allies from Faylaq ar-Rahman and possibly other bandits. Unfortunately, this threat remains.\" Russia\\\\\\'s embassy in Damascus again came under shelling on February 3, the ambassador said, adding that there was no serious damage to it. \"We constantly register shellings in close vicinity to the embassy,\" he added. \"Finally, a serious threat is coming not only from mortar shellings, but also from terrorist attacks, including with the use of suicide bombers,\" the ambassador said, recalling the January 12 suicide bombing in a government quarter in Kafr Sousa, in downtown Damascus. \"So, even during the ceasefire the level of danger is not reducing for us,\" Kinshchak stressed. \"That\\\\\\'s why, as before, we are forced to pay high-priority attention to ensuring security to increase the real protection of our staff members from all possible threats,\" he said.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. Russian Ambassador to Syria, Alexander Kinshchak has described the situation in Aleppo as \"not bad\"-and \"having a tendency towards improvement\". \"As for the unfreezing of our Consulate General in Aleppo, we think it\\\\\\'s too early now to raise the issue for security considerations,\" he said in an interview with TASS. \"The problem is bigger than the situation in Aleppo as such, since the latter is not bad and has a tendency towards improvement,\" Kinshchak said. \"The operative situation in northern Syria remains complicated and unstable in general.\"   He recalled that the international automobile road connecting Damascus and Aleppo remained blocked in Idlib Governorate and the bypass route was not safe because of sorties conducted by Islamic State militants. \"Aleppo international airport regularly undergoes shelling by terrorist units and even helicopters can\"t be absolutely safe as means of transportation in the situation as it is, since it\\\\\\'s well-known that the militants have shoulder-carried multiple launchers,\" Kinshchak said. \"If we reopen the Consulate General now, our fellow-diplomats who will be placed there will run into constant problems in communications with the embassy in Damascus,\" he said. \"I don\"t see any particular need in subjecting them to such risks, since they are civilians - regular diplomats and technical support staff, not military.\"\\'\\n \\'TAIPEI, Taiwan, Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/.-Infortrend Technology, Inc.

Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan told a news conference on Tuesday a council for joint economic operations with Russia on the Southern Kuril-Islands had been set up in Japan.   He told reporters he would stand at the head of the entity personally. Hiroshige Seko, a deputy minister of economy, commerce and industry who supervises economic cooperation with Russia in the government, will be deputy head of the council while representatives of other departments concerned high rank officials from the finance, agriculture and fishing industry ministries will take seats on it, well-informed sources told TASS. \"We hope to get down to tackling the problems of joint economic operations on the islands through the efforts of our entire government,\" Kishida said at the news conference. Sources also indicated the council will consider concrete projects of cooperation in the area of Southern Kurils, including fisheries, seafood farming, tourism, and nature conservation. Along with it, this cooperation should not call into question Russia and Japan\\\\\\'s fundamental positions as regards the sovereignty over the islands. Russia and Japan reached agreement on a start of consultations on joint economic operations on the Southern Kurils upon the end of Russian President Vladimir Putin\\\\\\'s visit to Japan on in the middle of last December. The first round of the consultations at the level of deputy foreign ministers is to take place in Tokyo next month. Moscow made first attempts to reach arrangements on joint economic activity on Southern Kuril Islands-at the end of the 1990\\\\\\'s but they encountered Japan\\\\\\'s reluctance to agree to putting this type of cooperation on the basis of Russian legislation. The Southern Kuril-range consists of the islands of Kunashir, Iturup and Shikotan and the Habomai archipelago.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/. -The Syrian Army, which is supported by the Russian Aerospace Force, is making attempts to recapture the initiative from the militants in the area of Palmyra, the Russian ambassador to Syria, Alexander Kinshchak told TASS. \"As for the military aspect of developments there, the Syrian government forces that are drawing on support from the allies, including the Russian Aerospace Force, are making attempts now to seize initiative from the Islamic State in this area.\"   He also said particularly intense combat operations were taking place near the T-4 airbase: \"Jihadists are suffering big losses there and are retreating. This is still some way off from Palmyra but I don\"t have any doubts its turn will come soon,\" Kinshchak said. \"Mass media are talking a lot about the situation in the ancient part of Palmyra and that\\\\\\'s why I don\"t see any need in an expanded advertising of the organization of diehard terrorists, which is banned in Russia, or in further comments on their barbaric actions against the monuments of the antique civilization,\" Kinshchak said. In March 2016, Syrian Army units supported by the Russian Aerospace Force liberated Palmyra after ten-months-long control by the IS. Russian army engineers took part in mine-clearing efforts in the city. On December 9, the IS attacked Palmyra again. The government troops retreated from the central part of the city on the night of December 11. On January 20, 2017, reports said the IS militants had destroyed the facade of the Roman Theatre and the Four Pylons architectural compound in Palmyra. It is too premature yet to discuss a possibility of liberation of Syria\\\\\\'s Idlib-from terrorists at this moment, the Russian ambassador to Syria-has warned. At this state, the priority task is to maintain and consolidate the ceasefire, he said: \"That\\\\\\'s why there\\\\\\'s no discussing the possibilities of \\\\\\'a march on Idlib\\\\\\' where militants from the liberated areas of Syria are flocking.-I think prospects for liberation will get clearer as long the separation of terrorists and the groupings ready to give up struggle against the government forces continues.\" Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist group-has created a new coalition to fight against the groups that took part in the talks in Kazakhstan\\\\\\'s Astana, Russia\\\\\\'s ambassador to Damascus stressed:- \"After the meeting of delegations of the Syrian government and the armed opposition in Kazakhstan\\\\\\'s capital on January 23-24, the terrorists of Nusra [Syrian branch of al-Qaeda]-made up a new coalition of very radically-minded Jihadists and started large-scale combat actions against their former \"Brothers-in-arms,\"?the representatives of whom took part in the above mentioned Astana event.\"- Representatives of the Syrian government and the opposition could create a joint constitutional commission to work on a draft of the new constitution: \"As for preparing a draft of the new constitution - and this task is considered to be vital by all the sound Syrian sides - here it would be right to speak about exchanging views and groundwork of various political forces, including with our participation, rather than practical work on agreeing on the text of a particular document. It\\\\\\'s a long way to go,\" the diplomat said.   \"For the beginning, an intra-Syrian working body should be probably created, for example, a joint constitutional commission with the participation of representatives of the government and the opposition,\" Kinshchak added.- The ambassador stressed that Russia\\\\\\'s key task remains the same - to \"encourage both representatives of the authorities and their opponents, the opposition, to jointly search for the ways out of the current crisis situation.\" This means \"providing assistance to the Syrian partners rather than doing something for them,\" the diplomat explained: \"As for preparing a draft of the new constitution - and this task is considered to be vital by all the sound Syrian sides - here it would be right to speak about exchanging views and groundwork of various political forces, including with our participation, rather than practical work on agreeing on the text of a particular document.

This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. \\\\nSome reporters in attendance were NBCâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABCâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBSâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 Norah Oâ\\\\x80\\\\x99Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox Newsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBCâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Phil Griffin; and CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. \\\\nUnfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was like a f*cking firing squad.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nTrump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThis claim was backed up by another person, who said: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrump kept saying, â\\\\x80\\\\x98Weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThis attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. \\\\nAmericans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter \\\\nInterestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nDisgraceful. \\\\nFeatured image by Christopher Furlong via Getty Images Share this Article!

The Storm God sent rain after him; he sent rains after him. Fear seized him; anxiety seized him. The god Hapantali went there. He stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell. The goddess Kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said: \"What in the world has happened here? A good question from Kamrusepa there then, but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isn\\\\\\'t really explained, so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldn\\\\\\'t he, the Moon, be seen having landed. My consideration is that the gate complex is that of the Cilician Gates , and that the Moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the Taurus Mountains with Silver. That region did relate to the Silver Mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in Silver at Kultepe/Kanes; The essence of the trade was to ship tin, woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to Anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire, directly or indirectly, silver and gold, which was shipped back to Assur. Tin, essential for the Anatoian production of bronze was imported in Assur from Susa, perhaps by Elamite caravans, and ultimately originated from Central Asia. Assyrian trade colony at Kanes There are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from Kultepe, on these sometimes can be seen the Taurus bull that bears upon it\\\\\\'s back the Silver Mountain. Also seen beneath on that example is the Scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the Cilician gates and greater region, also the symbol of Ishara the Goddess of the Silver Mountain and related to concept idea of the Moon within the Underworld, her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement, the Temple of Ishara being at Kanes or Nesi to the Hurrians. There were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then, including in Cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above Taurus in Gemini, and it\\\\\\'s opposite point of emergence in Scorpio, according to the inter-section point of the Galactic and Ecliptic planes. Were this gets interesting is that there is a Hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named The Song of Silver involving their tutelary God Tessub and his ongoing issues with Kumarbi, God of Destiny; Among Tessub, the Sun God of the Sky, Sauska Nineveh\\\\\\'s Queen, and all the gods, no one worships him, although his power is greater than their power. His word is greater than their words, his wisdom is greater than their wisdom, his battle and his g1ory are greater than theirs. It is Silver the Fine of whom I sing. Wise men to1d me the story of the fatherless boy. It did not exist. Long ago Silver\\\\\\'s Father had disappeared. And they do not know his sp1endor. Heroic men ran to battle. Abundance did not exist. And grain did not grow only hunger The Songs of the Kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to Byblos and Ebla, it is likely the same in this case, conflict with the region of Nesa and the Silver Mountains, this however relating to a much earlier period, potentially also this relates to conflict from the Heavens as Silver could be named Kubbabar-Anzu as noted here the association with Anzu in conflict with Tessub relating to the same with Ninurta in the Sumerian mythos, and that seemingly from Anatolia. The identification of Silver as DUMU also correlates with the Sumerian notion of the Divine child as Damu, often seen as the basis for the cult of Dumuzid, were it was also the case that the City of Dumuzid, Bad-Tivira, was the centre of the Sumerian metallurgy industry. Silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas DUMU, which means a child whose father is dead or missing. Hittitologists generally translate this as \"orphan,\" Silver\\\\\\'s consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time. The Song of Silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve Silver at some point establishing his power; Silver seized power with his hands. Silver seized the spear. He dragged the Sun and Moon down from heaven. The Sun and the Moon did reverence. They bowed to Silver. The Sun and the Moon began to speak to Silver: O Silver, our lord, do not strike/kill us! We are the luminaries of heaven and earth. We are the torches of what lands you govern. If you strike/kill us, you will proceed to govern the dark lands person-ally.\" His soul within him was filled with love.He had pity on them In dragging the Sun and the Moon down from Heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the Mountains with Gold and Silver, but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of Allani and Ishara at the time of silver, the spiritual qualities brought down to Earth. Hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from specialists in the field, which is a pity as they are more interesting than most. edit on Kam1031300vAmerica/ChicagoThursday2731 by Kantzveldt because: (no reason given)\\'\\n \"on November 4, 2016 12:25 pm Â· \\\\nWeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents.

I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his sonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he recalls. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate.

He simply said â\\\\x80\\\\x9cput on a suit and meet me outside,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and closed the door,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Melker wrote. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cDonald Jr. was a drunk in college.

But in new court documents, her lawyers say that the \"multi-year term\" during which she \"is one of the most photographed women in the world\" could mean millions of dollars for her personal brand. While the new documents don\\\\\\'t specifically mention her term as first lady, the unusual statement about her expected profits drew swift condemnation from ethics watchdogs as inappropriate profiteering from her high-profile position, which is typically centered on public service. The statement came Monday in a libel lawsuit the first lady re-filed in a state trial court in Manhattan. Trump has been suing the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail\\\\\\'s website over a now-retracted report that claimed she once worked as an escort. In the filing Monday, Trump\\\\\\'s lawyers argued that the report was not only false and libelous, but also damaged her ability to profit off her high profile and affected her business opportunities. Trump \"had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model, brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world,\" the lawsuit said. The products could have included apparel, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care and fragrance, among others, the suit says. The first lady is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million. Richard Painter, who advised former President George W. Bush on ethics, said the language in the lawsuit shows Melania Trump is engaging \"in an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain. This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money. That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress.\" Painter is part of a group of attorneys suing the president for an alleged violation of a constitutional clause that prohibits presidents from receiving foreign gifts or payments. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Charles Harder, Melania Trump\\\\\\'s attorney, said \"the first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted.\" Harder did not respond to a follow-up question about what the lawsuit means by \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" To Painter and others, there is no ambiguity. \"She\\\\\\'s not talking about the future,\" Painter said. \"She\\\\\\'s talking about earning money now.\" Scott Amey, general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight, said it is \"another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests.\" Trump previously filed the lawsuit against Mail Media Inc. in Maryland, but a judge earlier this month ruled the case was filed in the wrong court. The lawsuit is now filed in New York, where the corporation has offices. Trump also had sued blogger Webster Tarpley for reporting the unsubstantiated rumors. Trump filed the lawsuit in Maryland after both Tarpley and the Daily Mail issued retractions. On Tuesday, Melania Trump\\\\\\'s attorneys said they\\\\\\'d settled the Maryland case against Tarpley. \"Mr. Tarpley has issued the attached retraction and apology to Mrs. Trump and her family, and agreed to pay her a substantial sum as a settlement,\" Harder\\\\\\'s office said in a statement. Melania Trump\\\\\\'s previous work in marketing has drawn scrutiny before. On Inauguration Day, the official White House biography for Melania Trump originally included an explicit reference to her jewelry collection, which it noted was sold on the home-shopping channel QVC. By the next day, that bio had been edited and simplified to say that she had \"launched her own jewelry collection.\" A spokeswoman for the first lady said the website was updated out of \"an abundance of caution\" and that the jewelry line is no longer available in any case. President Donald Trump continues to financially benefit from his global business empire, breaking from past practice. Previous presidents and their families have divested from business interests and placed their holdings in a blind trust, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Trump handed daily management of the real estate, property management and licensing to his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization employee.\\'\\n \\'The Department of Justice blasted a court ruling that imposed a nationwide restraining order on President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s immigration executive action, citing \"national security\" as a reason for it to be reinstated. \"The State argues...that the injunction does not impose any irreparable harm. But the injunction reinstates procedures that the President determined should be temporarily suspended in the interest of national security,\" the reply brief to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, filed Monday evening, says. \"The potential national-security risks and harms resulting from the compelled application of procedures that the President has determined must be reexamined, for the purpose of ensuring an adequate measure of protection for the Nation, cannot be undone. Nor can the effect on our constitutional separation of powers.\" The DOJ also called Washington state Federal Judge James Robart\\\\\\'s action \"lastly overbroad, extending far beyond the State\\\\\\'s legal claims to encompass numerous applications of the Order that the State does not even attempt to argue are unlawful.\"?Today, the appeals court scheduled oral arguments in the case for 3 p.m. PT on Feb. 7. On Friday, Robart agreed with the states of Washington and Minnesota that Trump\\\\\\'s executive order -- which curtailed immigration and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries -- was likely to \"go cause irreparable harm\"?to businesses, schools, family relations, and state residents\"?freedom to travel and issued a nationwide temporary restraining order blocking most parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed to the 9th Circuit late Saturday night arguing that the president is acting within his authority and that the ruling by Robart \"second-guesses the President\\\\\\'s national security judgment.\"?Early Sunday morning, the 9th Circuit rejected the DOJ\\\\\\'s request for an emergency stay on the restraining order. Washington state\\\\\\'s lawsuit received support from major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Facebook, as well as former secretaries of state and national security officials. Former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and John Kerry joined former national security and foreign affairs officials including Leon Panetta, Janet Napolitano, Lisa Monaco, and Michael Hayden and wrote a declaration to the appeals court that \"where is no national security purpose for a total bar on entry for aliens from the seven named countries,\"?adding that as a national security issue, the executive order was \"ill-conceived, poorly implemented, ill-explained.\"?\"the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\"?Trump tweeted on Saturday. Trump has also tweeted that if something happens while his executive order is blocked, to blame the judge in the case.

Russian hockey players have grabbed the 23rd gold medal for the national team, securing an early win in the medal standings of the 2017 Winter Universiade underway in Kazakhstan\\\\\\'s Almaty.   Two days before the Universiade ends, the Russian national team boasts 23 gold, 20 silver and 13 bronze medals, well ahead of Kazakhstan, which is in the second place with ten gold, six silver and 11 bronze medals. The South Korean team ranks in the third place with eight gold, four silver and five bronze medals. Gold medals went to Russian cross country skiers Liliya Vassilyeva, Olga Repnitsyna and Anna Nechayevskaya in the relay 3x5 km women, to Yegor Berezin, Valery Gontar, Kirill Vichuzhanin and Dmitry Rostovtsev in the relay 4x7.5 km men, as well to speed skater Anna Pristalova winning mass-start gold. Russian women\\\\\\'s ice hockey team grabbed gold defeating the Canadian team 4:1. Bronze went to speed skater Alexander Razorenov in mass start. The Russian national team has secured an early win in the medal standings of the 2017 Winter Universiade with 23 gold, 20 silver and 13 bronze medals.   Sixteen sets of medals are yet to be awarded at the Winter Universiade. Kazakhstan, that comes second to Russia at the moment, is no longer claiming medals in women\\\\\\'s and men\\\\\\'s curling, men\\\\\\'s hockey and in women\"?snowboard (big air). Even if the hosts win all the remaining 12 gold medals, they will still have 22 gold medals against Russia\\\\\\'s 23. South Korea cannot seek the first place either, as it no longer fights for awards in men\\\\\\'s hockey as well as men\\\\\\'s and women\\\\\\'s curling. The World Student Games, or Universiade, is an international sporting and cultural festival which is staged every two years in a different city. The name of the international sports event is a combination of two words, which are \"university\"?and \"\\\\x98Olympiad.\"?It is only second to the Olympic Games. The program of the Winter Universiade currently includes 6 compulsory sports (8 compulsory disciplines) and up to 3 optional sports chosen by the host country. Almaty plays host to the 2017 Winter Universiade between January 29 and February 8.The next Winter Universiade will take place in Russia\\\\\\'s Krasnoyarsk in 2019.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/. The Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) expects that Belarus will early complete procedures for approval of the new Customs Code of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), EEC Board Member (Minister) on Integration and Macroeconomy Tatiana Valovaya told TASS on Monday. Minsk has had no grievances regarding the text of the document until now, she said.   \"We raised this issue [regarding Customs Code signing - TASS] for our Belarus counterparts, particularly at the last meeting at deputy prime ministers\"?level. Belarus colleagues said they are working on it and look forward to positive conclusion of the process. That is, they had no comments on that document,\" the minister said. The President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said at the meeting with reporters on February 3 that he ordered withdrawal of Belarus main specialists from customs authorities of the EAEU. According to Lukashenko, trade turnover of Belarus within the EAEU fell by 40% in 2015 and by 18% more last year. Valovaya said she has no data whether Belarus withdrew its specialists from EAEU customs bodies. \"I do not have such information,\" she said. Significant decline in mutual turnover among EAEU member-states was noted in 2015 and 2016, the EEC minister said. \"Our mutual trade contracted because of objective reasons and not because of integration. It declined because of economic growth slowdown; prices for oil and other energy resources fell,\" she added. Meanwhile, statistics already shows that the decline in trade within the Eurasian Economic Union has ended, Valovaya said. \"We actually observed the decline in mutual trade because of objective reasons. Growth has surfaced recently. Monthly trade in October and November 2016 were higher than monthly trade volumes in 2015,\" she added.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/.

The pullback of military hardware in Donbass on February 5 failed to take place due to Kiev\\\\\\'s acts of provocation, Russia\\\\\\'s OSCE Ambassador Alexander Lukashevich told Rossiya 24 television. \"Of course, there was a talk of the situation after the Contact Group\\\\\\'s decision on weapons pullback by February 5. Sadly, nothing was done because of continuing acts of provocation from Kiev that continues shelling and pulls in hardware,\" he said. According to the diplomat, although the OSCE\\\\\\'s Special Monitoring Mission \"fixes a lot of violations on both sides,\" provocative activities of the Ukrainian authorities cause a great damage to ceasefire efforts.   \"The armed forces of Ukraine had clearly triggered a new spiral of tension in Donbass, to which a special report of the mission of January 30 pointed,\" the Russian permanent representative to the European security agency said. \"We will urge the OSCE Mission to be not a mere passive onlooker but to act as a mechanism pushing the parties towards fulfilling their liabilities,\" he said. \"Even if it is not envisaged by the Mission\\\\\\'s mandate, but the very logic of its activities must be based on the necessity of not simply monitoring and verifying but also on the necessity of compelling the parties to implement their liabilities.\" \"This topic [of an OSCE police mission - TASS] is not on the OSCE agenda. It lost its topicality when no consensus was reached after certain consultations in 2016,\" he said. \"More to it, I know it for sure from conversations with the heads of the OSCE monitoring mission that this idea is seen as very dangerous, both from the point of view of personnel security and prospects for promoting settlement.\" He said that the Mission\\\\\\'s mandate is highly unlikely to be stopped soon. \"I have no information that anyone is interested in closing this European, or even international, verification mechanism that is acting on behalf of European society and even broader,\" Lukashevich added. Participants of the Contact Group on settlement in Donbass agreed on February 1 on the withdrawal of weapons and military hardware to the storage facilities by February 5.   He added that-extended Normandy Four format unlikely to anticipate settlement in Donbass. \"Naturally, this topic is outside the OSCE agenda as the Normandy Four format is a higher degree of interaction between the four countries,\" he said. \"It is an important instrument designed to help solve the problems of the Ukrainian settlement.\" \"As for possible extension of the Normandy format, I don\"t think, and this is my personal opinion, that it might hasten settlement in any way, at least now,\" he said. \"It\\\\\\'s more likely that the Ukrainian partners would seek to enhance their positions thanks to the West\\\\\\'s influence and would try to rebuild the entire logic of political settlement.\" According to the Russian diplomat, the Normandy format has become one of the driving forces of the entire settlement process.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/. Russia\\\\\\'s two-time Olympic Champion Yelena Isinbayeva has been chosen as an official ambassador of the 3rd Winter World Military Games to be held in Russia\\\\\\'s Black Sea resort city of Sochi on February 22 through 28, the press center of the Games said on Monday.   \"It is an honor for me to become an ambassador of the 3rd Winter World Military Games. It is a very important mission. Thank you for your confidence. In 2015, I decided to continue service in the Russian Armed Forces, in my home CSKA sports club because I want to work in the interests of the Russian military sports. I believe that our athletes have unlimited possibilities and they will be able to once again prove it at the Sochi Games,\" Isinbayeva said. Isinbayeva, 34, a triple world champion (2005, 2007 and 2013), with a total of 28 world records to her credit, who is credited as the greatest female pole-vaulter of all time, will carry the Russian flag at the Games\"?opening ceremony.

The new devices exhibit very high efficiency in light conversion (10.5%) comparable with those of perovskite batteries based on classical hybrid materials (about 12%). \"Our devices demonstrate tremendous efficiency and excellent repeatability of electric characteristics from sample to sample,\" one of the study\\\\\\'s coauthors, Professor Pavel Troshin of the Center for Electrochemical Energy Storage said. \"The obtained results demonstrate on the high potential of inorganic complex halogenides which offers new opportunities for target design of photoactive materials for effective and stable perovskite solar batteries.\" Perovskite is a mineral which is rare on the Earth surface, calcium titanate, while perovskites are various materials with crystal lattice similar to those of perovskite. In 2009, it was shown that perovskites are capable of effectively converting visual light into electricity, and ever since then they have been seen as a very prospective candidate for developing solar energy. In 2013, Science, one of the world\\\\\\'s most reputable scientific journals, included perovskite-based solar batteries into the top 10 main breakthroughs of the year. Batteries made from perovskites are cheaper than those based on silica and their production is non-toxic. These batteries can be made thin and flexible in order to place them on the surfaces of various curvatures. Nowadays, the best efficiency of conversion light into electricity is achieved by hybrid perovskite photocells based on organic-inorganic materials APbI3 where A can be various organic cations (A=CH3NH2+ or HC(NH2)2+). The performance coefficient of laboratory prototypes of such devices reaches 22% approaching the characteristics of photoelements based on crystalline silica. However, the commercialization of those setups is hindered by their poor service durability. Upon functioning, they deteriorate very fast due to thermal and photochemical decomposition of perovskites. The most efficient approach to creating stable perovskite materials is a complete replacement of organic cations to inorganic ones. However, such substitution is normally accompanied by a decrease in the devices\"?efficiency. For example, the solar cells based on CsPbI3 created by precipitation from the solution showed only 2-3% efficiency in light conversion. In the new study, the Russian scientists suggested producing CsPbI3 using another technology - thermic co-evaporation of cesium and lead iodides. As a result, the solar batteries based on these inorganic perovskites have demonstrated a stable performance efficiency figure of about 10%. Herewith, the reference samples of solar cells with an analogous architecture based on coatings of hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 demonstrate a comparable efficiency of 10-12%. The results of the study have been published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/. The Athletes\"?Commission of the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC) has criticized the decision of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) aimed at barring Russian para athletes from international competitions, the RPC press service said.   Earlier the International Paralympic Committee declined a bid from the RPC to allow Russian athletes to participate in the qualifying rounds for the 2018 Winter Paralympic Games. At the same time, the IPC said that Russia still had a possibility to take part in the Paralympic Games under quotas waived by national paralympic committees or upon bilateral invitation. During the meeting, athletes emphasized the need to closely cooperate with the IPC in order to continue the work aimed at restoring Russia\\\\\\'s membership. The meeting\\\\\\'s participants also backed the RPC\\\\\\'s decision to continue training athletes for the winter and summer Paralympic Games, implement the membership restoration criteria, develop interaction with international sports federations as well as Russia\\\\\\'s independent public anti-doping commission headed by Vitaly Smirnov, and protect the interests of athletes taking into consideration Russia\\\\\\'s legislation and international laws. Besides, the participants in the Athletes\"?Commission\\\\\\'s meeting reiterated that there had never been any state-backed doping system in Russia. Moreover, the athletes stressed that there was no place for doping in sports since doping posed a threat to athletes\"?life and health while those using doping violated the principles of fair play.   \"The situation has been difficult for all the Russian para athletes, but we should not lose courage,\" Vice President of the Russian Paralympic Committee Rima Batalova said. \"We need to have patience, unite and try to do our work in the best possible way,\" she stressed. \"We will use all the possible tools to ensure that our athletes take part in international competitions, including the Paralympic Games in South Korea\\\\\\'s Pyeongchang,\" she added. \"We would like all our athletes to have a chance to compete and win medals for our country, see Russia\\\\\\'s flag rise in their honor and hear the national anthem of our great country,\"-Batalova said.\\'\\n \\'adobochron 1 Comment \\\\nMANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) â\\\\x80\\\\x93 This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines. \\\\nMany of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy. First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you canâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBarya lang po sa umaga!â\\\\x80\\\\x9d No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod knows who doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t pay,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBayad poâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (hereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s my fare) and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cPara poâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (this is my stop). If you donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepneyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s roof. It also means â\\\\x80\\\\x9cplease stop.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say â\\\\x80\\\\x9cone seniorâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d or â\\\\x80\\\\x9cone studentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride. Rate this:\\'\\n \\'The 51-50 vote ends Trump\\\\\\'s toughest confirmation battle yet. Senate Democrats debated through the night and into Tuesday morning in a last-ditch attempt to derail DeVos, buoyed by support from Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Throughout the fight, Democrats argued they needed \"Just one more!\" to lure away another Republican vote. But Senate Republican leaders succeeded in delivering a victory to Trump in a confirmation fight that very few expected to become as tough as it did. DeVos\\\\\\' poor performance in her confirmation hearing -- punctuated by her suggestion that a school in Wyoming might want to have guns on premises to protect against grizzly bears -- contributed to roaring anger among public school supporters and teachers unions. Even before her hearing, critics pointed to DeVos\\\\\\'s lack of experience with public schools and her bankrolling of efforts like school vouchers that could take money from public institutions. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer voiced his displeasure with the vote moments after she was confirmed, tweeting, \"Today @VP Mike Pence did something no one else has ever done: cast the tie breaking vote on his own cabinet nominee.\" Devos tweeted after the vote, \"I appreciate the Senate\\\\\\'s diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. Let\\\\\\'s improve options & outcomes for all US students.\" Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN earlier Tuesday that DeVos seemed to have no knowledge of the federal law that protects students with disabilities. \"You put those two things together, lack of compassion for what\\\\\\'s happened to places like Sandy Hook and an inability to just understand the basic law around vulnerable students and it was clear at the end of that hearing that this was someone who shouldn\\\\\\'t be the secretary of education,\" the Connecticut Democrat said. DeVos\\\\\\' Senate vote comes after a dramatic 24 hours of protest from Democrats inside and outside the Capitol that lasted through the night, into Tuesday morning, with Democratic senators taking shifts in the Senate arguing against DeVos. The delay tactics have succeeded in stalling many of Trump\\\\\\'s most important Cabinet picks -- but Senate Republican leaders promised Monday to get votes for four nominees this week: DeVos, Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price, Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin and attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more questions have been raised about Trump\\\\\\'s Cabinet picks. Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder admitted Monday to hiring an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper.

The 102x71mm postal bloc containing a 30x42mm stamp at a par value of 100 rubles and issued with a circulation of 250,000 copies will be offered for sale at branches of the Post Office of Russia,\" the press office said.   In addition to the stamps, the Post Office of Russia will issue first day covers and prepare special redemption postmarks for the cities of Volgograd, Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Kaliningrad, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Samara, St. Petersburg, Saransk and Sochi where the ceremony will be held on February 7. The campaign to choose an official mascot for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia started in April 2016. At the first stage, Russian football fans chose ten candidates, after which a special panel picked three finalists - the wolf, the cat and the tiger. The open voting held on October 21, 2016 announced the Wolf called Zabivaka (the one who scores) as the winner of the contest. Russia is currently in full-swing preparations for the global football tournament after the country clinched the bid, following the final vote at the FIFA Executive Committee in December 2010. The victory came following a tight race against the bids from England, Portugal and Spain, in addition to a joint bid on behalf of Belgium and the Netherlands. The country selected 11 host cities to be the venues for the matches of the 2018 World Cup and they are Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan, Saransk, Kaliningrad, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and Samara. The matches of the 2018 World Cup will be held between June 14 and July 15 at 12 stadiums located in the 11 above-mentioned cities across Russia. Two of the stadiums are located in the Russian capital of Moscow.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/. Three populated localities in Syria have joined ceasefire in Syria in the past day, the Russian center for reconciliation of the warring parties in Syria said in its regular daily news bulletin posted on the official website of the Russian defense ministry of Monday. \"During the day, agreements on joining cessation of hostilities were signed with the settlements of Harasta al-Basal and Muhayam-al-Wafedin in Damascus province and the settlement of Btigramo in Latakia province,\" the center said, adding that the overall number of Syrian settlements that have joined the reconciliation process has reached 1,198.   Talks on joining cessation of hostilities were continued with field commanders of armed opposition groups in the provinces of Aleppo, Damascus, Homs, Hama and al-Quneitra, as follows from the bulletin. The number of armed groups stating their commitment to the ceasefire in line with the agreement of February 27, 2016, has remained unchanged - 109. The number of opposition units joining the ceasefire has also remained unchanged, standing at 64. Syrian government troops have liberated an area of 53.1 square kilometers over the past 24 hours, the Russian center said. An overall area of 1,220.9 square kilometers has been liberated from January 1, the center added. Russian officers in the Russian-Turkish joint commission set up to monitor ceasefire violations in Syria reported three ceasefire violations in the province of Latakia and one in Hama. Turkish officers reported seven ceasefire violations, including five in Damascus province, one in Aleppo province and one in Homs province. Seven violations were not confirmed by the Russian side, the bulletin said. The nationwide ceasefire came into force across Syria at midnight on December 30, 2016 under the agreement on a complex solution to the Syria crisis. Syrian government forces and groups of armed opposition with an overall strength of more than 60,000 have joined the agreement. Russia and Turkey act as the ceasefire guarantors. Ceasefire does not cover terrorist groups, such as Islamic State.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/. The price tag for a vacation in the Russian city of Sochi will not grow this year, Sochi Mayor Anatoly Pakhomov said following his meeting with representatives of big tour operators at the Federal Tourism Agency (Rostourism). \"I am confident that those working in the accommodation industry will hear and understand us. Hotel prices will not grow compared to 2016, I am completely sure of that,\" Pakhomov said.   He added that a meeting of accommodation industry representatives from all four Sochi districts would take place next week. \"We will gather them all and explain what risks they could create if they raised the price tag,\" the Sochi mayor said. According to him, the city authorities will ensure the tourists\"?safety. \"We guarantee your safety, this is one of our advantages,\" he stated. According to Pakhomov, as many as 6,500,000 people visited Sochi in 2016, which is the highest number to date. The mayor explained that \"it became possible because many accommodation facilities had been brought into operation.\" \"We are capable of providing accommodation to 200,000 visitors (at a time),\" Pakhomov said. \"Our opportunities are huge, so we want tour operators to know that we are ready to join their efforts aimed at improving the tourism industry\\\\\\'s efficiency,\" the mayor noted adding that in Sochi tourists would feel safe and comfortable. Pakhomov stressed that new competitors for Sochi had been emerging which were seeking to dump prices. \"Tourists used to travel abroad are our main challenge but Russian resorts have many advantages, Turkish and Egyptian resorts know that so they will have to improve their capabilities.\" Pakhomov pointed out that package tours to Sochi were on sale through 26 regional travel agencies for the second year in a row.

The European Union\\\\\\'s anti-Russian sanctions have failed to reach a desired effect and hit the the European economy instead, Hungary\\\\\\'s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said on Monday. \"The sanctions regime against Russia has failed both in economic and political terms,\" he said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers.   He said the sanctions imposed on Russia following its reunification with Crimea were an \"erroneous response.\" These sanctions have inflicted economic damage on the European Union and all its member states, Szijjarto stressed. The Hungarian top diplomat noted that the issue of the anti-Russian sanctions should be considered at a next summit of the European Union. Following the developments in Ukraine in 2014 and Crimea\\\\\\'s reunification with Russia, the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia and has numerously extended them ever since. Talks on visa-free travel and on a new basic cooperation agreement were suspended. A number of Russian officials were banned to enter the European Union and their assets were frozen. Apart from that, the European Union imposed trade, financial and defense-sector restriction. In all, more than 150 individuals and several dozens of legal entities have been blacklisted by the European Union. Sectoral sanctions were imposed on a number of Russian financial, oil producing and defense entities.\\'\\n \\'MOSCOW, February 6. /TASS/.

The introduction of a border zone along Russia\\\\\\'s border with Belarus does not imply any restrictions on the rules of crossing the border that concern individuals, transport or goods, the public relations center of Russia\\\\\\'s federal security service FSB told the media after the FSB director issued an order to create a border zone on the border with Belarus in Russia\\\\\\'s Smolensk, Pskov and Bryansk regions. The FSB explained that these rules impose no restrictions on the freedom of travel across the border by either country\\\\\\'s citizens.   \"The establishment of the border zone does not envisage border control of individuals, vehicles, cargoes, goods or animals or creation of border checkpoints,\" the FSB said. Russian and Belarussian citizens in the border zone are obliged to follow the border rules established by the FSB on October 15, 2012, equally applicable to foreign nationals and Russian citizens. The FSB explained that the border zone had been introduced to identify and prevent transit illegal migration, drugs trafficking and illegal movement of goods and valuables across the border. \"The border zone was established with the aim of creating the necessary conditions for the reliable protection of Russia\\\\\\'s state border in accordance with Article 16 of Russia\\\\\\'s law of April 1, 1993 On the State Border of Russia and of carrying out measures to prevent legal abuse within the competence of border control agencies.\\'\\n \\'ASTRAKHAN, February 6. /TASS/.

Researchers from Russia, the UK, and Switzerland demonstrated that the endothelin receptors type B have almost no influence of the fission of cells of unstriated muscles of vessels, the press service of Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology said. The results of the study imply that to cope with the vessel diseases, remedies need to be developed aimed at interacting with endotheline receptors type A (ETA) and time should not be spent on working with endotheline receptors B (ETB). The article describing the study has been published in the journal Hypertension.   \"The experiments show no significant role of ETB receptors in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. This is new information which may potentially save lots of money and effort just by pointing out the way which one should not follow, and namely, creating an ETB antagonist based anti-atherosclerotic drugs,\" commented Skoltech Professor Yury Kotelevtsev, Associate Director of Skoltech Center for Functional Genomics, and a coauthor of the study. Endothelines are substances synthesized by the human body for constricting vessels. In order for them to function, they must be bound to corresponding receptors which are located in the vascular walls. These receptors can be classified into two types: A (ETA) and B (ETB). The ETA and ETB receptors govern the processes of vessels constriction and distension, as well as the growth of their tissues, and consequently play an important role in the evolution of some diseases, for instance, pulmonary hypertension and atherosclerosis. To clarify the role of ETB receptor in the control of growth of smooth muscles cells, the scientists switched off the genes coding the receptor. Using a mouse, they damaged the arterial walls in the limb of the rodent to track the growth of vessel tissues without ETB receptors and found out that this receptor has almost no effect on the fission of cells after vessel damage. According to Kotelevtsev, the scientists expected to come to sharply contradicting conclusions. But now, additional experiments have been scheduled, since these crucial results must be rechecked before finally being validated.\\'\\n \\'Turkey has transferred government stakes worth billions of dollars in its flag carrier Turkish Airlines, the country\\\\\\'s largest bank by assets Ziraat Bank and fixed-line operator Turk Telekom to a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). Some analysts told DW that ahead of the planned presidential referendum, which would allow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to consolidate his power, this move would lead to greater political control of the companies, but without the necessary oversight. Analysts also said that the newly transferred assets could be used as collateral to secure funding for major infrastructure projects. Political control \"The move is likely to increase political control over the companies now owned by the SWF,\" said Wolfango Piccoli, director of research at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. \"The transfer of state assets to the SWF comeses at a time of increasing political involvement in the economy,\" he said. Piccoli said that over the last 18 months, more than 600 privately-owned companies have been seized by the government on suspicion of links with the-exiled Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who Erdogan blames for orchestrating the failed July 15 coup attempt last year. More than 600 privately-owned companies have been seized by the government over the last 18 months In the third quarter, the economy shrank for the first time in almost seven years while investors worry that the structural reform agenda would stall due to Erdogan\\\\\\'s ambition to boost the economy ahead of the presidential referendum. \"The creation of the wealth fund will, in all probability, allow Erdogan and his team to exercise greater control over companies in which the state already owns large stakes, but without the level of transparency demanded by members of Turkey\\\\\\'s political opposition (especially the CHP),\" Anthony Skinner, director of the Middle East and North Africa practice at Verisk Maplecroft, told DW. Mega Projects The Erdogan government in 2013 announced 200 billion dollars worth of infrastructure investments as part of its 2023 goals. Building a waterway and the world\\\\\\'s largest airport in Istanbul were among these goals, as Erdogan has been relying on large scale projects to bolster the construction industry and boost domestic demand. The economy has slowed following the coup attempt and analysts said that President Erdogan aims to revive the stalling economy with mega projects. \"The creation of the fund confirms the government\\\\\\'s goal to drive large infrastructure projects forward to boost economic growth over the coming years. Infrastructure mega-projects and the government\\\\\\'s diplomatic offensive to expand exports are intended to help offset the impact of reduced domestic consumption and demand in 2017,\" Verisk Maplecroft\\\\\\'s Skinner said. In recent months, Erdogan has applied intense pressure to commercial banks to increase loans to the private sector in an attempt to boost flagging economic growth. Erdogan has also been pressuring the central bank for some time to lower interest rates to support economic growth. The country has been hit by rising regional tensions, political uncertainties amid widening concern about the crackdown following the failed coup, which also battered its currency. \"The government is currently struggling to finance a series of high-profile infrastructure projects. Erdogan hopes these will boost his domestic prestige and enable him to consolidate his grip on power through the introduction of an executive presidential system with almost no checks or balances,\" said Piccoli. The Yavuz Sultam Selim bridge, which spans the banks of the Bosphorus, was opened in August 2016 Fiscal discipline? Some are concerned about the motive of the decision, despite the claims by the government that the fund will not compromise fiscal discipline. \"I think there are several reasons for concern. One is that it suggests that Turkey is unlikely to privatize key companies in which the state has an interest (providing further evidence that the reform agenda is unlikely to restart). Another reason is that it could provide scope for a significant loosening of fiscal policy,\" Capital Economics economist William Jackson told DW. The fund, approved by parliament in August, is headed by Mehmet Bostan, a former banker and head of the privatization administration last year. Appointments to the board included Erdogan\\\\\\'s advisers and aides. Sovereign wealth funds are often associated with oil producing countries, such as Norway or Gulf states, who set aside money from energy exports for investment. Norway\\\\\\'s $890-billion (832 billion euros) sovereign wealth fund is the world\\\\\\'s largest. \"One final point I would make is that we tend to think of wealth funds (such as those in the Gulf) having significant foreign currency assets; ultimately, those can be sold to improve the balance of payments position. But, Turkey\\\\\\'s wealth fund would hold lira assets, so it couldn\\\\\\'t be used in the event of another balance of payments shock,\" Jackson said. Opposition politicians expressed concerned about the move. Opposition party CHP lawmaker and former treasury undersecretary Faik Oztrak told a press conference that \"this government set up a wealth fund to pledge the assets left by our ancestors to borrow and cover up the volatility in the economy until the referendum.\"\\'\\n \\'The strongman of Poland\\\\\\'s ruling national-conservative party has stoked a debate that was previously held in only a very limited capacity. In an interview with the daily \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,\" Jaroslaw Kaczynski said Europe should be a superpowerwith a nuclear arsenal to rival that of Russia. He conceded that such a program would, however, be very costly and that he did not anticipate such investment. That aside, Kaczynski has broached a taboo subject typically only embraced by individual voices. One example is German parliamentarian Roderich Kiesewetter, of the conservative Christian Democrats, who recently told Reuters news agency that \"Europe needs nuclear protection as a deterrent\" if the United States were no longer to extend its protection. But how realistic are such ideas? Franco-British nuclear capability? \"It\\\\\\'s not surprising that we\\\\\\'r seeing this kind of debate now,\" said Nick Witney, former head of the European Defense Agency and now a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. In principle, it\\\\\\'s about the question of whether US President Donald Trump is prepared to sacrifice Chicago to save Warsaw. And what would his answer to that be? The political situation has changed so quickly, and with it the current state of defense policy. But how credible would a European nuclear deterrent be? Thirty years ago, London and Paris would have been flattered to be chosen as the defenders of the European continent. But what EU state would be prepared to accept such a nuclear defense force now? Never mind what Britain\\\\\\'s decision to leave the EU has done to whatever credibility that idea still had. How credible would Britain be as a nuclear deterrent power for Europe? For his part, Witney says he doesn\"t believe in a common European nuclear power. \"You would need institutions for that which the EU doesn\"t have,\" he said. That leaves just France with its nuclear weapons which, in an emergency, could perhaps still just about \"rip the arm off of a Russian bear.\" Witney\\\\\\'s conclusion: \"The discussion is very much one that is on the fringe, if not completely out of the realm of the possible.\" EU nuclear weapons would be a mistake \"There is no concrete threat,\" said Ulrich K¨¹hn of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The arguments for such a discussion are all there now in the Trump era, but at the same time, he says, this is \"not helpful.\" NATO still exists, and under US leadership, conventional weapons are being stationed in Poland stationed in Poland and the Baltics. As long as NATO exists, Europeans should stay away from a nuclear race, he said. Moreover, K¨¹hn added, the suggestions are not practical. \"Russia has between 2,000 and 3,000 tactical nuclear weapons,\" meaning that Europe would face enormous expenses if it were to acquire an adequate arsenal to serve as a deterrent. And the main question is who would control the red button? Aside from these issues, there\\\\\\'s also the fact that a majority of European citizens, including those in Poland, are against engaging in a nuclear arms race. K¨¹hn also believes it is dangerous that the non-proliferation treaty would effectively be voided if the Europeans were to withdraw from it. \"That would have global consequences,\" he said. \"You could suddenly see the creation of 55 to 60 nuclear countries - a horrific scenario.\" Instead, he said, the Europeans should finally do what they have long talked about doing: Take concrete steps towards realizing defense cooperation, sign agreements and work together on weapons systems in order to be more effective and credible in conventional defense measures. Gahler: \\\\\\'We don\"t want to revive the old arms debates of the 1980s\\\\\\' No to a nuclear arms race Michael Gahler of the defense committee in European Parliament is also in favor of greater EU-wide cooperation. \"We should finally do what the Lisbon Treaty allows us to do, which is to implement structural cooperation,\" he said. Of the 203 billion euros ($217 billion) spent on defense in the EU, 26 billion could be saved or otherwise allocated if the member states would only work together, according to a parliamentary paper on common defense policy. \"Common acquisition, common exercises and common structures\" are the next steps, according to Gahler. But he also said that a nuclear arms race would be a mistake. Although he perceives Russian tactical nuclear weapons as a real threat, he believes that overall, there is a balance when it comes to nuclear deterrents. \"We don\"t want to revive the old arms debates of the 1980s,\" Gahler said. While he admitted that Russia and the United States of today were not foreseeable at the turn of the century, Gahler remains firm in his belief that \"this is a debate that should not be started.\"\\'\\n \"Hamburg 2-0 Cologne (Jung 5\\', Wood 76\\') Hamburg scored a goal in each half to dump Cologne out of the German Cup and reach the last eight.

Many of those affected have had to flee their homes. The majority of the displaced are sheltered by communities who are themselves among the world\\\\\\'s most vulnerable.- The Lake Chad Basin crisis was until recently one of-the fastest growing refugee-crises in Africa and it is becoming the most acute food and nutritional crisis in Africa. It is the fourth biggest humanitarian response for United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations-in 2017. Toby Lanzer, the assistant Secretary-General to the UN, spoke to DW ahead of the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region at the end of February.- DW: How is the humanitarian situation in the Lake Chad region? Toby Lanzer: The situation continues to be very grave. I think over the past few months we have understood more fully what is happening thanks to an improved security situation which has enabled the United Nations and its partners to travel further afield from the main town, Maiduguri, and get a stronger appreciation from the people themselves who have been stuck in many villages and towns. -But we know that there are millions of people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and we are doing our utmost together with the international community to meet the needs. Lanzer says the displaced often end up in vulnerable regions Has the response from-foreign governments been adequate? Well, adequate is a difficult word to use. And I think there are so many crises in different parts of the world. I think that via DW and others we are hoping to get the word out. That there is a particularly grave crisis the numbers are huge 10 million in need, 7 million who are severely food insecure, and 515,000 children who are acutely malnourished. I don\"t think any single government on earth in the world could face that alone. International solidarity is required. And that is required at a time when pressures are high all over the globe and so, no, the response is inadequate at the moment but am hopeful that in coming weeks more countries will come on board and help the UN and NGOs-to work with the communities and the authorities of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and of course of Nigeria, to meet the needs. What support do you want from the German government?- I think Germany has really come on board as a very strong supporter in political terms and the chancellor herself has been to Niger one of the key countries in this region. I think that political support usually signals financial support which I understand will be on its way. -And at the end of the day, that\\\\\\'s actually what people need because the money will be translated into medicines, food, shelter, and all the other things that people who are in desperate need require on a day to day basis to weather this terrible storm that\\\\\\'s afflicted them. What is your wish as far as the donor\\\\\\'s conference is concerned? There will be a conference thanks to Germany, Nigeria and Norway, and with support of the UN, the international community will gather in Oslo Norway on the February 24. I think my wish there is really a stronger recognition by a broader range of countries including Canada, the Netherlands, and Korea. Let\\\\\\'s say a broader range of countries who recognize the gravity of the situation and the scale of the need and that that they actually join the effort of countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the-European Commission and the UN in meeting peoples various serious need to survive this violence-perpetrated by Boko Haram, which comes on top of abject poverty, climate change and real challenges which have wrecked peoples lives and made it so very difficult for them.- What could the governments of the countries located in the Lake Chad region do? - We are hopeful that, whether it\\\\\\'s Cameroon, Chad, Niger or Nigeria,-they will continue to do what they have been which is to do that utmost to care for their own people. But there are limits to what poor countries can do. And you know on that note so many people look at me and say \"-isn\"t -Nigeria a rich country?\" Well it is and it is not. At the moment oil production has plummeted.-Oil prices are low so it\\\\\\'s a very trying moment for Nigeria to do everything that it would like to for its own-people. But let\\\\\\'s congratulate the government of Nigeria and others in the region for having facilitated the work of the aid agencies. For having made sure that we feel welcome,-for making sure that we are safe. This is a difficult part oft the world to be operating in. Violent extremists are not particularly easy by any means when it comes to the populations of the region, but also aid agencies. So the governments really have been very forthcoming trying to do as much as they possibly can, but also welcoming the international communities support in this time of severe crisis.

Because the vice president also serves as the-president of the Senate, Pence is allowed to vote in the cabinet confirmation process.-The Senate historian said this marked the first time a vice president had to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. Democrats had fought hard against DeVos\\\\\\' confirmation. After Pence cast his vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - who had previously called DeVos \"the least qualified nominee in an historically unqualified cabinet\" - doubled down on his statement-on Twitter.- Two Republicans opposed DeVos It had been a particular divisive-cabinet pick. Teachers unions opposed DeVos\\\\\\' nomination because the former head of the Michigan Republican Party believes in \"school choice\". DeVos champions voucher programs-that allow parents to send their children to the school of their choice - including privately-run, for-profit schools. Teachers advocates believe that this would hurt the funding of public-schools. The 59-year old also-garnered criticism from-civil rights advocates for her conservative religious beliefs. Two Republicans broke-rank in order to oppose DeVos\\\\\\' confirmation, along with all 46-Senators from the Democratic Party and two Independents-closely affiliated with the Democrats. A champion for school choice Democrats held the floor of the Senate for 24 hours ahead of the vote-in an effort to halt DeVos\\\\\\' confirmation. They repeatedly-criticized her lack of experience - the businesswoman has never worked in education --as well as the fact that DeVos has-financial stakes in-organizations promoting private schools. DeVos has-promised to divest herself from these-organizations. During her confirmation hearing, the wealthy Republican donor at times stumbled, leading her opponents to argue that she was unfamiliar with key debates in education policy. President Donald Trump stood by DeVos, describing her as a \"reformer\" and-accusing Democrats of protesting to \"keep the failed status quo\".- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell argued in favor of DeVos ahead of the vote, saying that she would-empower states to make important education decisions instead of federal bureaucrats. \"I know that she is committed to improving our education system so that every child - every child - has a brighter future,\" McConell said.- Not the only controversial pick While many of Trump\\\\\\'s cabinet picks have already been confirmed, Republicans are hoping to vote another batch of nominees into office this week: Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Representative Tom Price as health secretary and hedge fund manager Steve Mnuchion as treasury secretary. Sessions in particular has been deemed a controversial choice - in 1986, the US Senate denied him a federal judgeship because of controversial, racially-charged-statements former colleagues testified Sessions had made.- Pence (57) is an experienced politician. After working as a lawyer and conservative talk radio host, he served for 12 years in the House of Representatives before becoming governor of Indiana in 2013. The father of three has strongly opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage throughout his career. He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" The CEO of oil giant Exxon Mobil has close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin - he was even awarded Russia\\\\\\'s \"Order of Friendship\" in 2013. Despite this, and the Texan businessman\\\\\\'s lack of experience in foreign policy, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee narrowly approved Tillerson\\\\\\'s nomination. Priebus (44), a lawyer and familiar face on the Wisconsin political scene, has served as director of the Republican National Committee since 2011. He has said that the Trump administration will aim to \"create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\" After a long career on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs, Mnuchin (53) set up a hedge fund and made millions of dollars buying and rebranding a failed mortgage lender after the 2008 crash. He has since financed several Hollywood movies. Mnuchin wants to cut taxes for businesses and the middle class and will consider public-private partnerships to fund infrastructure projects. The retired Army general - and registered Democrat - was fired as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. He has referred to Islamism as \"a vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people on this planet\" and his son, a Trump aide, recently lost his job for spreading a fake news story that claimed Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s allies were running a pedophile ring from a Washington pizzeria. The Alabama Senator was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. A former lawyer, Sessions (69) takes a hard line on immigration and strongly opposes legalizing of marijuana. Allegations of racism, including a former colleague\\\\\\'s testimony that Sessions joked he thought the Ku Klux Klan were \"okay, until I found out they smoked pot,\" cost him a potential federal judgeship in 1986. During his 44-year military career, Mattis (66) earned nicknames like \"Mad Dog\" and \"warrior monk.\" He led the US Central Command from 2011 to 2013, and was a key figure in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His appointment as Defense Secretary would depend on a waiver from the Senate, as US law requires that retired military personnel wait seven years before they can take up this role. Upon his retirement in January 2016, Kelly (66) was the longest serving Marine general in US history. As head of the US Southern Command, he was responsible for US military activity in South and Central America, which included oversight of the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. Kelly\\\\\\'s eldest son was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010. The Montana lawmaker and former Navy SEAL commander had been expected to run for the Senate in 2018. Zinke (55) has advocated increased energy drilling and mining on federally controlled land. While skeptical about the urgency of climate change, he does believe it is important for the United States to invest in renewable energy. He describes himself as a \"Teddy Roosevelt Republican.\" The former Indiana senator was US ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005 under the George W. Bush administration. Coats (73) is considered a mainstream Republican and served on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees. A vocal critic of Russia, he pushed for Moscow to be punished for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. The Kansas congressman is a member of the Republican Tea Party movement and a former Army tank officer. Pompeo (52) has defended the use of torture methods, such as waterboarding, and opposes the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison. He once said that Edward Snowden, who exposed the National Security Agency\\\\\\'s mass domestic surveillance program in 2013, deserved to receive the death penalty. The two-time presidential hopeful said during his 2012 run that, should he get into the White House, he would scrap the Department of Energy. Perry (66), who served as governor of Texas for 14 years, sits on the board for the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, which is pushing to build the controversial Dakota Access pipeline. He once called Trump a \"cancer on conservatism.\" The former chairman of right-wing website Breitbart News became Trump\\\\\\'s campaign chief in August. His CV also includes stints as a naval officer, investment banker and Hollywood producer. Ben Shapiro, a former editor-at-large of Breitbart, described Bannon as \"a nasty figure\" and \"a smarter version of Trump\". Carson, a retired neurosurgeon from Michigan, made his first foray into politics as one of Trump\\\\\\'s rivals in the Republican presidential primary. During the campaign, Carson made controversial comments on topics such as evolution and climate change. The investor and former banker made billions in restructuring failing companies in industries such as steel and coal, later investing in troubled European banks during the financial crisis. Ross, 79, was a vocal Trump supporter during the election campaign and believes the US needs a \"more radical, new approach to government.\" Lighthizer served as deputy trade representative during Ronald Reagan\\\\\\'s presidential administration. He returns to government after working as a lawyer for US steel companies for nearly three decades. Like Trump, the 71-year old has argued that the US needs to defend its economic interests against China more aggressively to reduce the US-China trade deficit. Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which runs fast food chains Hardee\\\\\\'s and Carl\\\\\\'s Jr., has long argued against higher minimum wages and government regulation in the workplace. He has frequently criticized the new Labor Department rule that extends overtime pay to more than 4 million workers, and praised the benefits of automation in the fast food industry. As a prominent figure in the \"school choice\" movement and chair of the American Federation for Children, DeVos is an advocate of charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. She is a long-time Republican Party donor and her father-in-law is Richard DeVos, the billionaire founder of US company Amway. In 2001, Chao was appointed Labor Secretary under George W. Bush, becoming the first woman of Asian descent to take a US Cabinet position. She previously worked in banking and as director of the Peace Corps, expanding its presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Chao (63) immigrated to the USA from Taiwan at the age of eight and is now married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The former orthopedic surgeon was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012 and named Budget Committee chair in 2015. Price, 62, is a staunch opponent of Obamacare, advocating a system based on medical savings accounts. Price has voted against federal funding for abortion and opposes gun control. Over the past five years, the Oklahoma state attorney general - a vocal climate-change skeptic - has brought multiple lawsuits against the very organization he is now due to lead.

She has supported reduced financial regulation and a lower corporate tax rate. Trump described her as \"one of the country\\\\\\'s top female executives advising businesses around the globe.\" Mulvaney was voted into the House of Representatives in 2011 as a \"Tea Party\" Republican. As someone who opposes federal governmental spending, the 49-year old from South Carolina could help Trump defund the Affordable Care Act, but might also be at odds with his trillion dollar infrastructure investment plan. Donald Trump\\\\\\'s son in law, who already served a pivotal role in his campaign, will also serve as an adviser in the Trump administration. The son of real-estate tycoon Charles Kushner is married to Trump\\\\\\'s daughter Ivanka. He previously worked in real estate and publishing and had never worked in politics before the start of the Trump campaign. Haley (44) is serving her second term as the Governor for South Carolina. After the mass shooting at an African-American church in Charleston in 2015, Haley, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, pushed for the confederate flag to be removed from the grounds of the South Carolina state house. She referred to Trump\\\\\\'s proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US as \"un-American.\" Shulkin already served as Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health under President Barack Obama.

The raids involving 250 police and prosecutors, including special squads, were focused on Bavaria but also two locations in the neighboring federal states of Baden-W¨¹rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. You might be interested in reading this: Reichsb¨¹rger movement on the rise in Germany Ingolstadt police spokesman Hans-Peter Kammerer said seven of the 16 persons targeted Tuesday were suspected of acting as self-appointed officials of a fictional \"State of Bavaria\" based in Pliening, east of Munich. Charges pending, says police spokesman Kammerer The others were suspected sympathizers who had obtained and used fake documents. The accused had deluged authorities with written objections to fines and confiscation orders \"in which they expressed their crude legal views and lodged counterclaims,\" according to the Ingolstadt police bureau. The contents amounted to attempted extortion, attempted coercion and impersonation of officialdom, investigators said, who said the probe had begun last week into the issuing of falsified identity documents and drivers\\\\\\' licenses. This \\\\\\'passport\\\\\\' seized last June asserts the existence of the \\\\\\'German Reich\\\\\\' Grouping numbers 10,000 Last month, the federal head of Germany\\\\\\'s VfS domestic intelligence service Hans-Georg Maassen said the \"Reichsb¨¹rger scene\" of activists and sympathizers - mostly middle-age white males - was thought to number about 10,000.

But there is another subterranean element to this debate, which now should be surfaced, especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics. Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K-12 education almost 50 years ago, and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling, public and private, today. DeVos\\\\\\' track record suggests that as secretary, she will do little to combat these trends. In the wake of the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal, the federal government began -- albeit slowly -- to desegregate. This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation. The backlash, now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today, was fierce. From Alabama Governor George Wallace\\\\\\'s stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of \"segregation now, segregation forever\" to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement, the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics. But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools. Thus, an estimated half-million white students left public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in schools that were known as \"segregation academies.\" This move to private schools was part of a larger \"white flight\" movement. White flight was one of the greatest demographic shifts in American history. Millions of whites nationwide moved out of cities and into racially isolated suburbs. Scholar Kevin Kruse has called white flight \"the most successful segregationist response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts.\" The character and quality of most American schools today, like the neighborhoods in which they are found and which they shape, have a racial past. Now, American public schools are falling back into a kind of racial segregation that is reminiscent of our country before Brown. In the last 25 years, the number of severely racially isolated schools, defined as those with 0-10% white students, has tripled. In 2010 in New York City, 92% of black students and 88% of Latino students attended schools that were majority-minority, some of which see such severely racialized and concentrated poverty that they are dubbed \"apartheid schools.\" In DeVos\\\\\\'s own state of Michigan, which has seen two decades of charter school growth, enrollment and funding for public schools has waned while schools have become increasingly segregated. Nor does public funding for private schools, which DeVos advocates, seem to achieve much good for students of color. Voucher and other public funding programs are marketed as appealing because tax dollars \"follow the child.\" But research over the past fifteen years shows that private schools are even more racially segregated than public schools. This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color. Research shows that both black children who attend desegregated schools end up with more income, higher wages and better long-term health, with no negative effects on white students. Further, a range of studies strongly suggest that desegregated schools educate all children such that they can better contribute to American society and to a healthier American economy. It is therefore both a moral outrage and an economic mistake that so much of the current movement in favor of school choice and religious education carries the stain of racial animosity, even in dog-whistle form. Of course, many private and religious schools are excellent and inclusive places of learning. But let\\\\\\'s not be fooled. School choice is not really about freedom. Freedom, of course, is a bedrock American value. But the kind of \"freedom\" associated with the flight away from integration and toward racial isolation will never lead to a more truly free United States. So as senators consider DeVos\\\\\\' nomination to oversee public education for every American child, they would do well to remember the deepest values of public schooling, as well as the deeper meaning of appointing a Secretary of Education associated with a more exclusive and racially exclusionary vision.\\'\\n \\'With 90 votes to 34, Scottish parliament voted overwhelmingly against triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Tuesday - with most of the votes against coming from UK Prime Minister Theresa May\\\\\\'s-own party, the Conservatives.

Soon after the vote, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon-confirmed the result-on Twitter, writing that Scottish parliament had voted \"overwhelmingly\" against triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

That\\\\\\'s the inconclusive conclusion that Germany\\\\\\'s foreign and domestic intelligence agencies came to last fall, following several months of investigation which was delivered to Merkel\\\\\\'s chief-of-staff Peter Altmaier in the form of a 50-page report. Altmaier chose not to make the report public, but it was leaked to the \"S¨¹ddeutsche Zeitung\" newspaper this week. According to the paper, the BND (Germany\\\\\\'s equivalent of the CIA) and its domestic counterpart, the Verfassungsschutz (BfV), was charting a \"middle way\" between two conclusions - firstly, that the Russian government is not directly spreading misinformation in Germany, and, secondly, that it is, but it couldn\\\\\\'t be proven. \"An open/direct control or financing through Russian state authorities or Russian intelligence agencies could not be proven in any cases,\" the report said. Nevertheless, such activities \"could be carried out by people and organizations outside the services.\" Though these various external protagonists \"were not playing a prominent role in endangering Germany\\\\\\'s security interests,\" \"further investigative efforts\" were still necessary, the intelligence agents added. Merkel commissioned the report into Russian intervention Threads to the Kremlin Despite not being able to find any direct evidence, the German spies seemed convinced that the Russian government is coordinating a campaign to \"sow disunity in the EU and Germany, and so to weaken their position of power\" from the highest levels of the Russian government: \"The bundling of all the influencing activities in the presidential administration does represent a significant success factor.\" The report listed three well-publicized examples of how Russian actors may have spread misinformation in Germany - or at least about Germany. The first was the case of \"Lisa,\" a 13-year-old Russian-German living in Berlin, who told police in January 2016 that she had been raped by people of \"Mediterranean appearance.\" Though she later admitted to having made the story up, the case made international headlines and sparked protests outside Merkel\\\\\\'s office by both far-right groups and the Russian community in Berlin. The situation escalated when Russian state media and the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the German police of covering up the crime. \"The news that she disappeared was kept secret for a very long time,\" Lavrov told a press conference. The newly-leaked German intelligence report also noted a Russian-language WhatsApp message that was widely distributed among Russian-speaking Germans last winter, which read, \"Muslims organizing a sex-jihad in Europe on February 14.\" This was part of a conspiracy theory alleging that a Muslim hate preacher had called on his followers to mass-rape German women on that date. Since the message was deemed \"amateurish,\" the German intelligence agencies concluded there was no involvement from Russian secret services. Meanwhile in other cases, the German chancellery decided that the agency\\\\\\'s conclusions were too speculative - one of the reasons it was not made public. No clear agenda Mark Galeotti, Russian security specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said this lack of clarity was nothing new. \"There\\\\\\'s no question that Russia is supporting and sponsoring a campaign to use disinformation to try and have a political impact,\" he told DW. \"The issue isn\\\\\\'t: \\\\\\'Is there a fake news campaign?\\\\\\' Yes, of course there is. The issue is: \\\\\\'Is all fake news Russian?\\\\\\' The answer is clearly not.\" Altmaier said much of the evidence was inconclusive \"There is evidence of the Kremlin\\\\\\'s involvement, but there isn\\\\\\'t evidence of how effective it is,\" Galeotti said. \"The Kremlin puts a lot of money into its soft power arms like [state news outlet] RT and we know that the Kremlin lies to a considerable degree for political effect. We also know there are attempts to carry out more covert and subversive acts - secret funding for political groups, that kind of thing.\" Indeed, the new German report found \"possible Russian influence attempts\" being made on Germany\\\\\\'s nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Russia\\\\\\'s alleged hack on the Democratic National Convention in the US last year unsettled many in Germany who wonder whether the Kremlin may be planning a similar attempt to sabotage the Bundestag election in September - even if the hack\\\\\\'s ultimate effect on the US vote, balanced against other factors, is impossible to quantify. Not only that, is toppling Merkel actually Moscow\\\\\\'s conscious policy? \"Well maybe - but there\\\\\\'s a certain degree of stability in having Merkel as chancellor, and you never know quite what an alternative government would mean,\" pointed out Galeotti. \"It\\\\\\'s not like the Russians want to conquer Europe - I don\\\\\\'t believe that for a minute - but what they do want to do is ensure that Europe is too divided to prevent Russia from imposing its will on Ukraine, and Belarus, and Georgia.\" Furthermore, just because Russia has state news outlets doesn\\\\\\'t mean they are constantly being controlled by the state. \"I know people who work in the RT newsroom,\" said Galeotti. \"Occasionally, yes, there is the phone call that says, \\\\\\'this is the line\\\\\\' when something big happens. But usually when there\\\\\\'s a story, there are bunch of people who know roughly what the Kremlin wants, and they say, \\\\\\'can we use this, can we spin this?\\\\\\' It\\\\\\'s almost entrepreneurial disinformation. It\\\\\\'s opportunistic.\"\\'\\n \"At the bottom of theS¨¹dtribune on Saturday, a large, yellow banner with black words read: -\\'For the people\\'s sport of football, against those who destroy it.\\' Dortmund-fans\\' are absolutely entitled to defend the tradition of their club.

Not just with banners but with makeshift weapons. The assaults on-blameless Leipzig fans must have come as a shock to the numerous people who gaze at Germany\\'s football culture with-envy. Even before Germany won the World Cup in 2014, the country worked-hard to market \\'the German football experience\\' --and with good reason. Cheap tickets, great atmosphere, the inclusive role fans play - and the great football. Hundreds flew in for a weekend of football at Borussia Dortmund or Schalke. It was a chance to become part of a raw football community centered around Saturday afternoons.

DW\\'s Jonathan Harding This match-was an opportunity-to expel-a hatred that has been bubbling under ever since Leipzig arrived in the Bundesliga. Dortmund fans (and many football fans for that matter)-are rightly aggrieved that this club from the east has bypassed the one rule (50+1 rule) holding the stitches of the German-game together.-But-attacking, spitting or hurling abuse at others just for supporting their team is a world away from feeling wronged by an administrative body. Football violence is not a new phenomena, but the motive for these attacks is. How can it be at all acceptable to harm-someone because you don\\'t like the way their team is run? RB Leipzig have satisfied the yearning of-fans in the east of Germany-for quality, top-flight football. They\\'ve created a-new culture - one that quite frankly is preferrable to some of the moronic elements of the one they-met on Saturday. Whether Leipzig have played by-the rules is a different question. German FA (DFB) President Reinhard Grindel has called for a change in the culture of violence in German football. There needs to be an end to the culture of violence, not a change. No one is asking for the emotion of football to be lost, but there is a world of difference between emotional support and physical-rage.\"\\n \\'What goes on in far-right filter bubbles on Facebook?

Worldwide, populists benefit from such activities; their supporters rarely challenge the \"facts\" they are presented. Alarming radicalization Humans, Schweiger says, tend to believe information passed on by those who hold the same or similar views they do. A week into the experiment, \"Mayer\" had many friends on Facebook and was invited into closed groups where users openly urged resisting the system. Forget inhibitions: Interspersed between cute cat photos and pictures of weddings, posts would read \"Shoot the refugees, stand them in front of a wall and take aim,\" while others denied the Holocaust. No one objected. Blind to other people\\\\\\'s views By day 12, \"Mayer\" had 250 Facebook friends - real people who never met him in person but felt he shared their beliefs. Neuhann and Gebhard wondered what would happen if \"Mayer\" were to pipe up and disagree. The refugee situation in Germany has led to a rise in outspoken right-wing sentiment So they posted official statistics showing that crime rates have not risen despite the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany. To no avail, Neuhann-says: \"We were either ignored or insulted.\"- It\\\\\\'s a parallel world, Neuhann says. Part of the bubble is so far gone there is no way reasonable arguments can reach them, he adds, arguing that some people are only partially involved. They still have a life and maybe a job, so they might be approachable, though \"perhaps not as much online as offline.\" Asked whether the reporters are afraid now that their story is out in the open, Neuhann says no, since \"Hans Mayer\" wasn\\\\\\'t the fake account\\\\\\'s real name. It hasn\\\\\\'t been deactivated, but the journalists broke off their experiment after three-weeks. The right-wing-filter bubble continues to exist.\\'\\n \\'The name John Towner Williams may not ring any bells initially, but there\\\\\\'s a good chance you\\\\\\'ve heard him before. Williams, who celebrates his 85th birthday on February 8, 2017, is one of the most heard composers of our time, having written the soundtracks to the of the biggest blockbusters of the past half-decade.- The New England-born composer and pianist got his start in 1955 as a student at the Juilliard School of Music after serving in the Air Force. After his studies, he moved on to Los Angeles, where he recorded with Henry Mancini throughout the 1960s while composing for some of the most popular television series of the time. His music set the backdrop for paradise-gone-wrong on the series \"Gilligan\\\\\\'s Island,\" created the mood in \"Lost in Space,\" and later provided the theme music for the drug-addled antics in 1967\\\\\\'s \"Valley of the Dolls,\" for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Inspired by Richard Wagner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Williams has won-numerous awards throughout his career, becoming-the second-most-nominated person in Academy Award history with 50 Oscar nods. Among his Oscar-award-winning compositions are the scores for the cinematic successes-\"Schindler\\\\\\'s List,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Jaws\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" He likewise holds 22 Grammys, four Golden Globes and seven British Academy Film Awards to his name. Setting movies to music As the theme music to many of the highest-grossing films of all time, Williams\\\\\\' scores have helped instill-many film-goers with unforgettable-emotions:-The ominous two-note ostinato from \"Jaws\" still rings in many of our ears when we step into an ocean and a pit of dread forms in our stomachs.- The leitmotifs that run through the-\"Star Wars\"\\\\\\' space-epics made the soundtrack one of the highest grossing non-popular music recordings of all time. It\\\\\\'s hard to imagine Superman taking flight or Indiana Jones running from a giant boulder without the blast of trumpets. Even Harry Potter\\\\\\'s magic wand gains new life when waved to the sounds of Williams\\\\\\' compositions. Despite all the successes Williams has achieved thus far in his career, he shows no signs of slowing down at 85, continuing to lend his talents to numerous films. A good friend of Stephen Spielberg\\\\\\'s, he has written the soundtracks for-\"Munich,\" \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and, more-recently, \"The Book Thief\" and-\"Lincoln.\" Next up: the music for the latest in-the Star Wars-series. -\\'\\n \"GM\\'s European subsidiary Opel last year failed once again in its attempt to turn into a profitable entity. GM announced Tuesday that Opel\\'s losses for the full year 2016 stood at around $257 million (239 million euros). The parent company, however, profited from positive conditions in its home market, the United States, which allowed it to boost sales of pickups and SUVs. The Detroit-based automaker was also able to replicate its success across the world, selling a record number of around 10 million vehicles.- The firm\\'s annual revenue, meanwhile, rose nine percent to about $166 billion. Net income, however, fell 2.7 percent to $9.4 billion. GM currently ranks third among global automakers, behind Germany\\'s Volkswagen and Japan\\'s Toyota. While Volkswagen sold 10.3 million vehicles worldwide in 2016, Toyota followed closely with sales of 10.18 million vehicles. Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann has-blamed the British vote to leave the EU and the consequent fall in value of the pound sterling for the company\\'s bad results. Opel would have made a profit if the pound hadn\\'t depreciated the way it did, he said, noting that the carmaker improved its earnings by around $600 million during the previous year. Opel is also planning to launch a number of new models this year, as part of its efforts to reverse its fortunes.

One option under consideration is sending migrants back to Libya. What\\'s your view on that? Martin Kobler: Of course, I understand that the Europeans want to stem the flow of migrants from and via Libya, but at this point in time, repatriation to Libya is not a viable solution. There are inhumane things happening here. There are human traffickers at work, there are crimes against humanity. All this has to be stopped. There are international standards, the Geneva Convention has to be respected. And that\\'s why people shouldn\\'t be sent back to face terrible circumstances, such as those in Libyan refugee camps. I think everyone can agree on that. Could you describe the conditions in the camps? They\\'re not like the refugee camps in Jordan, with tents from the UNHCR. The camps in Libya are very crowded, and some people have to sleep standing up or on top of one another, or take turns. Around 10 percent of the male refugees are malnourished. Then there\\'s the problem of disease and abuses by the state. People are being beaten and raped, and some have even been shot. It\\'s completely lawless, there\\'s no order. These are not the kind of circumstances under which you can send refugees back to Libya - that would be completely unacceptable. Again, I understand that the EU and Germany want to limit the number of refugees coming to Europe. But you can\\'t send them back to camps where they will go hungry, be tortured and raped. The fact that neither Germany nor the EU has diplomatic missions in Libya shows how precarious the security situation is there. What has to happen to create the kind of conditions where refugees could be sent back to Libya? Martin Kobler is the UN Special Representative for Libya The solution lies in building up strong state structures. And when Libya is once again a country where there is rule of law and where human rights in the camps can be guaranteed, then we can talk with the government about the possibility of bringing people there. But in the more immediate term, how can we prevent people using Libya as a starting point for their journey to Europe? We need to extend the reach of the coast guard. And we have to improve the humanitarian situation in the camps. And thirdly, we need to increase the number of people who would voluntarily return to their home country. Last year, we sent 3,000 people back to their country of origin. The fourth element lies in improving the situation in the countries of origin, because people don\\'t choose to undertake such a long journey if there is no good reason. Usually, they choose this option if they are subject to political persecution or economic hardship. If the Europeans can work with the countries of origin to improve conditions, then fewer people will make the choice to leave. Libya is considered to be a crisis region. How long will it take before the situation there improves? I don\\'t want to make any predictions about that. The situation here has stabilized somewhat. We have started a political process, but there are no effective state structures. And it\\'s impossible to say how long it will take before there is a proper government in place. Libya has rarely ever had strong state institutions. This is a country that can look back on two generations of the Gadhafi dictatorship - it\\'s hard to get over something like that overnight. Libyans know that, the international community knows that. But we\\'re working hard so that this country which has the largest oil reserves in Africa, no longer needs the support of the international community, and so that the people of this country can enjoy the prosperity that they deserve. Martin Kobler previously served as the German ambassador to Egypt and Iraq. Since November 2015, he has been the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). UNSMIL recently published a study on the conditions in camps in Libya.

For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. \\\\nThe White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that â\\\\x80\\\\x98Putin is hacking the US elections.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 In response, the President is weighing his options â\\\\x80\\\\x93 tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed â\\\\x80\\\\x98malicious cyber-activityâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 tools. \\\\nEven VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,â\\\\x80\\\\x9dWeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIt seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? \\\\nWhat was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected Americaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washingtonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s new anti-Russia movement. \\\\nOn July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAnyone who was paying attention back then knew this â\\\\x80\\\\x98Russian hackâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 talking point was purely political, but then again, whoâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. \\\\nYou can trace the genesis of the Democratic Partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, â\\\\x80\\\\x98comparing one dictator to another.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\nNever one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. \\\\nBacked by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia â\\\\x80\\\\x93 not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The mediaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cHackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nBut then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe bureau described the threat as â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccredibleâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and significant, â\\\\x80\\\\x9can eight on a scale of one to 10,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the stateâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s voter registration system for nearly a week.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAnd then, down to almost nothingâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAt no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAre American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: â\\\\x80\\\\x98bottom of the bagâ\\\\x80\\\\x99) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories â\\\\x80\\\\x93 in the middle a national election cycle? Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. \\\\nBehind Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White Houseâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nOn October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign manager John Podesta â\\\\x80\\\\x93 giving them to Wikileaks. \\\\nSoon, there was a queue of â\\\\x80\\\\x98national securityâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cRussia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putinâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, Â\\\\xadcyber and economic response.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAccording to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only â\\\\x80\\\\x98evidenceâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged â\\\\x80\\\\x98Russian government hacksâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrikeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s word for it. \\\\nIMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. \\\\nThe Postâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Nakashima then added: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAn online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are â\\\\x80\\\\x9cconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the joint statement said. â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦ We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nMoscowâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s press secretaryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s reply: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is some sort of nonsense,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dmitry Peskov. \\\\nDespite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really â\\\\x80\\\\x9cconfirmedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that Russia was behind the email hacks â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. \\\\nLikewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cRussia did it,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona â\\\\x80\\\\x93 are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a â\\\\x80\\\\x98 parallel universe .â\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\nStill, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how â\\\\x80\\\\x9c 17 US intelligence agencies â\\\\x80\\\\x9d aka the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIntelligence Communityâ\\\\x80\\\\x9dâ\\\\x80\\\\x93 all agreed that Russia did it. \\\\nThe announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Clinton. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI find that deeply disturbing.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nWhatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9917 agenciesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99: \\\\nAir Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\\\nWhat does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podestaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s emails? Answer: nothing. \\\\nThe exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. \\\\nIn both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washingtonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cjournalistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN â\\\\x80\\\\x93 none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s decree that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cRussian is hacking the US election process.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦ [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow â\\\\x80\\\\x94 the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are â\\\\x80\\\\x98hackingâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a â\\\\x80\\\\x9c disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nUnder partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpeople linked to the Trump team with Russia.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI havenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t come up with anything. \\\\nTo be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack â\\\\x80\\\\x93 because her staff read it to her from the campaignâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US governmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddamâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraqâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s imaginary â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWinnebagos of Deathâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. \\\\nFor those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as â\\\\x80\\\\x98Washington Intelligence,â\\\\x80\\\\x99 I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, that was Iraq, that was Bush. Weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re not like that. No, this time itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIn 2014, Obama claimed that Kimâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s notorious â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBureau 121â\\\\x80\\\\x9d hacked into Sony Pictures. \\\\nThis isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign â\\\\x80\\\\x98hackâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washingtonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called â\\\\x80\\\\x98 Bureau 121 .â\\\\x80\\\\x99 Just like with todayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9cRussian Hackâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White Houseâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the â\\\\x80\\\\x98Russian Hackâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . \\\\nJumping the Shark \\\\nAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. \\\\nSoon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdestabilize and dominate the West.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of â\\\\x80\\\\x98interferingâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x94 Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 \\\\nClinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only â\\\\x80\\\\x98evidenceâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as â\\\\x80\\\\x98proofâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaignâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s desperate claims. It was embarrassing. \\\\nThey could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. \\\\nEither way, the political strategy here is clear â\\\\x80\\\\x93 to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video â\\\\x80\\\\x93 their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. \\\\nTheir other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. \\\\nTo prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this yearâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this weekâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Clinton. \\\\nThe party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. \\\\nParty Meltdown \\\\nWasserman Schultzâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s replacement didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches â\\\\x80\\\\x93 showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives â\\\\x80\\\\x93 straight to Hillary Clinton. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9c A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jake Tapper.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9c A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Source: Daily Caller ) \\\\nBrazileâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: \\\\n. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazileâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying a lot. \\\\nIn addition, it was also revealed how CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of â\\\\x80\\\\x98journalistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 the Clinton campaign would â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwork withâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d to gain favorable coverage. Youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s election coverage. \\\\nClearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN\\\\\\'s Gloria Borger refers to being in \"GOP hell\" and says she\\\\\\'ll \"reach out soon\" to Podesta.

Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . \\\\nSo why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top â\\\\x80\\\\x93 to the President himself. \\\\nWhat 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillaryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s server â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Presidentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cObama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s private email server.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSo, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails â\\\\x80\\\\x9coff gridâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server â\\\\x80\\\\x93 maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. \\\\nSure, heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club â\\\\x80\\\\x93 caught out lying to the American people. \\\\nOn top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as â\\\\x80\\\\x9c born classified .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. \\\\nCOVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) \\\\nIt should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action â\\\\x80\\\\x93 that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. \\\\nOn Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case â\\\\x80\\\\x93 currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a â\\\\x80\\\\x98sextingâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes. Recall our post from last week, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillaryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Benghazi Hearing â\\\\x80\\\\x9d in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nOh, and if that wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t good enough, Kadzik was also Podestaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as â\\\\x80\\\\x98best friends.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 FOX News confirms: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podestaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. \\\\nTo call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. \\\\nRussia â\\\\x80\\\\x93 The Party Scapegoat \\\\nFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIronically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x94 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 \\\\nAnother veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe KGBâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d working with Republicans to â\\\\x80\\\\x9chijack the electionâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d during his wild rant on MSNBC . \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. Thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I think,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Carville. \\\\nMaybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. \\\\nThese are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many exposÃ©s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence â\\\\x80\\\\x93 unlike the â\\\\x80\\\\x98Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\nSuffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that â\\\\x80\\\\x98Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 Theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a perfect double entendre . \\\\nThe geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washingtonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown â\\\\x80\\\\x93 that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed â\\\\x80\\\\x98rebelsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. \\\\nWith so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? \\\\nThe demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup dâ\\\\x80\\\\x99etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing Americaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was forced to resign shortly after that. \\\\nWhatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although â\\\\x80\\\\x98 Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,â\\\\x80\\\\x99 and â\\\\x80\\\\x98 Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 â\\\\x80\\\\x98 certainly comes to mind. \\\\nThat said, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of â\\\\x80\\\\x98Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washingtonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election \\\\nOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSelf-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. \\\\nKnowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere â\\\\x80\\\\x93 if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. \\\\nStill, weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington â\\\\x80\\\\x93 before itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s too late. \\\\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\\\nSUPPORT 21WIRE â\\\\x80\\\\x93 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \\\\nFiled Under: Featured , Patrick Henningsen , Shout , US News Tagged With: CNN , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Donna Brazile , Gloria Borger , Hillary Clinton , Media Cog , Russia , wikileaks WillDippel \\\\nHere is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: \\\\nSometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory. WeAreYourGods \\\\nWanna bet money that the Weiner laptop, on which the over 600,000 emails were stored in a folder titled â\\\\x80\\\\x9cLife Insuranceâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, holds information linking the CF to human trafficking and typical elite pedophilia â\\\\x80\\\\x9cvacationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d? Ever wonder why nobody ever really goes after the Clinton Foundation from a government office?

Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazing that a US President would invent a Russian Hacking conspiracy theory in order to drive a geopolitical agenda.

Sheâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s should never be allowed near public office. \\'\\n \\'DW: Donald Trump has handed over the management of his businesses to a trust run by his sons. A Trump lawyer also said that the company would not engage in any new foreign deals during Trump\\\\\\'s tenure and that new domestic deals would be vetted rigorously by a neutral ethics advisor. What\\\\\\'s wrong with that approach? Richard Painter: The president still owns the businesses, which means that all the money that is paid into the businesses is for the financial benefit of the president. And the money that comes from foreign governments, banks controlled by foreign governments or sovereign wealth funds is in violation of the United States Constitution. The Constitution specifically prohibits anyone who holds a position of trust with the United States government, including the president, from receiving economic benefits from foreign governments. So that money from foreign governments and entities controlled by foreign governments is unconstitutional. Other money coming into the Trump business empire from private sources creates serious conflicts of interests. We are very concerned about the president having investments all over the world in places where there could be all sorts of trouble. That is not a good situation for the United States and so we feel strongly that the president needs to divest ownership interest from his businesses. The head of Germany\\\\\\'s BGA foreign trade association has said new economic alliances are required to offset the expected negative impact from Donald Trump\\\\\\'s protectionist agenda - and keep German exports strong. (07.02.2017) US President Donald Trump has lashed out against a federal judge over legal pushback against his travel ban. Though that is disturbing, the good news is that the system of checks and balances seems to be working. (06.02.2017) A court in San Francisco is to hear the US Justice Department\\\\\\'s arguments over whether the entry ban should be restored. The order, which temporarily bars people from seven Muslim-majority states, is currently on hold. (07.02.2017) You along with several other prominent lawyers and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) have sued President Trump under the so called Emoluments Clause, which bars high government officials from receiving gifts or money from a foreign state. You filed the suit a few days after the inauguration. What is the current state of the lawsuit? This is one of dozens of lawsuits against the president in his official capacity because the way in which the president has chosen to run his administration and conduct his business. Our lawsuit asks the judge to look at the foreign government payments coming into the Trump business empire, to look at the Constitution and decide what the president can and what he cannot keep under the Constitution. The suit has been filed and the judge shall decide what the procedures going forward shall be and when decisions will be made. That is out of our control at this point. While many legal experts agree that you may be right on the issue, they argue that you don\\\\\\'t have the necessary \"standing\"-to win the case, meaning that you are not personally hurt and affected by the case. How do you counter that? The federal courts in the New York area where we filed the suit have been willing to give standing to organizations such as ours which had to substantially alter their work and their mission and have been affected by the unconstitutional conduct of government officials. There is case law in the second circuit court supporting our positions and we hope that the courts do give standing. Ultimately the Supreme Court may have to rule on that issue. If the courts do not give standing to organizations such as ours, then the courts may end up not deciding this constitutional question at all and the alternative would be for the House of Representatives in two or three years to convene a hearing and investigate and find out what foreign government money the president has received and then think about what action to take. The problem is that this is a very politicized process and will be for sure if the Democrats ever get control of the House of Representatives. It could result in impeachment of the president - a constitutional crisis - and this is something we believe can be avoided if the courts in a much more neutral manner are willing to give us standing and then decide what the president can keep and what he cannot. Former chief White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter Much has been made recently by opponents of the president about the 25th amendment as a possible way to remove Donald Trump from office without impeachment. The amendment allows the removal of a president who is deemed unable \"to discharge the powers and duties of his office\"-temporarily by a majority vote of the vice president and cabinet, but ultimately requires a two-thirds vote in Congress. Do you consider this as a realistic option at all? The 25th amendment is used to deal with a different situation - when the president is incapacitated, not when he is acting illegally. It is designed to deal with a president who is incapacitated due to the president\\\\\\'s physical or mental health. At this point, all I would say is that President Trump should use better judgment in his public statements. That\\\\\\'s where we are right now. I don\\\\\\'t think the evidence is there at this point to say that the president is not physically or mentally capable of carrying out the duties of the president. But I do think he needs to be somewhat more careful and balanced in what he communicates to the public. You served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Can you briefly compare how President Bush dealt with ethics questions and how President Trump is handling it? President Bush insisted that he as president set a good example for everyone working in the administration and that he set the right tone at the top. And President Bush, like every other president in recent memory, made absolutely sure that he had no financial conflicts of interests with his official duty. He followed the same rules as everyone in his administration. He did not say that he was somehow special because he was president. He never would have said that the president does not have a conflict of interest unless the president indeed had taken the steps that he took to make absolutely sure that there was no conflict of interest in fact. The president is not above the law and President Bush was adamant about that point. That\\\\\\'s one of many respects that President Bush was quite different. He also felt very strongly that our country must welcome people of all religions and races. President Bush right after 9/11 made it very clear that the United States was not in a war with Islam and that we welcome Muslims to our country. We are certainly at war with extremism of any sort and that that is what the war on terror is about. President Bush would never have tolerated any effort to denigrate or discriminate against Muslims in the United States. He recognized that that was un-American and unconstitutional. Richard Painter is a law professor at the University of Minnesota. From 2005 to 2007 he served as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. The interview was conducted by Michael Knigge.\\'\\n \\'Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi said that any EU member state had to provide a visa on humanitarian grounds if-new arrivals were judged to be at risk. The announcement came after Belgian authorities refused to grant humanitarian visas to a family from the besieged city of Aleppo, arguing their links to the city were too tenuous and that they were not obliged to admit everyone coming from a war zone like Syria. \"The Belgian State was not entitled to conclude that it was exempted from its positive obligation under Article 4 of the Charter,\" Mengozzi said, referring to the European Union\\\\\\'s rulebook on human rights. Mengozzi\\\\\\'s opinion is not binding - however, the advocate general\\\\\\'s comments are usually followed by the court, which is due to rule on the case of the Syrian family in the coming weeks. The ruling could affect policy across all EU member states. Daily fines Belgian State Secretary for Migration, Theo Francken, made controversial remarks that may cost the Belgian taxpayer hundreds of thousands of euros Belgian Immigration Minister Theo Francken made a controversial statement about the family from Syria in November 2016, saying that he would rather sell-his office furniture in order to pay-daily fines for defying EU guidelines on admitting refugees instead of honoring a court ruling in favor of the Syrian family. Belgium has been fined 4,000 euros ($4,270) a day for defying a local appeal tribunal in the case. The family is believed still to be in Syria. Many EU states are struggling to process and care for hundreds of thousand of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, the majority of whom undertake perilous journeys to the EU to apply for asylum on arrival. ss/rt-(AP, Reuters, dpa) Famous for his theory of relativity, German Jewish Nobel Prize laureate Albert Einstein was visiting the US in 1933 when it became clear he could not return to Nazi Germany. He seems to have had mixed feelings about life in exile. He once wrote that he felt \"privileged by fate\" to be living in Princeton, but \"almost ashamed to be living in such peace while all the rest struggle and suffer.\" German singer and actress Marlene Dietrich, she of the husky voice and bedroom eyes, was already a star living in the US, when she acquired American citizenship in 1939 and turned her back on Nazi Germany. A prominent refugee, she spoke out against Hitler and sang for US troops during the war - while her films were banned in Germany. But she said: \"I was born a German and shall always remain one.\" He was a Harvard professor, an authority on international relations, the 56th US Secretary of State, and instrumental in shaping American foreign policy - but in 1938, Bavarian-born Henry Kissinger fled Germany to escape Nazi persecution. Nevertheless Germany, the nonagenarian said in a speech several years ago, \"has never ceased being a part of my life.\" Born in what is now the Czech Republic, Madeleine Albright and her family fled to the US in 1948 when communists took over the government. She got involved in politics and went on to become the highest-ranking woman in the US government: the first female Secretary of State (1997-2001). Born in Vienna in 1919, Lord George Weidenfeld was a British Jewish publisher who immigrated to London in the aftermath of the Nazi annexation of Austria. He co-founded a publishing company, served as chief of staff to Israel\\\\\\'s first president, and funded the rescue of Syrian and Iraqi Christians. \"I can\\\\\\'t save the world \"?but I had a debt to repay,\" he once said. The 20th century Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist and folk music collector Bela Bartok was not a Jew, but he was opposed to the rise of Nazism and the persecution of the Jews. In 1940, he moved to the US. \"My main idea, which dominates me entirely, is the brotherhood of man over and above all conflicts,\" Bartok is quoted as saying. Milos Forman, already a leading art-house film director, turned his back on Czechoslovakia and moved to the US after the Prague Spring of 1968. He went on to make two internationally acclaimed Oscar-winning movies: \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\\\\\'s Nest\" (1975) and the 1984 period drama film \"Amadeus.\" Chilean President Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup and died in 1973. His cousin\\\\\\'s daughter Isabel (who called him uncle) fled to Venezuela after herself receiving death threats. She later settled in the US. Her novels are internationally-acclaimed classics of magical realism, including the \"The House of the Spirits\" and \"Eva Luna.\" Miriam Makeba - lovingly know as Mama Africa - was on tour in the US when the South African government cancelled the young woman\\\\\\'s passport for campaigning against the Apartheid regime and later banned her from returning home. Her song \"Pata Pata\" was a worldwide hit in 1967. The legendary singer lived in the US and Guinea before she saw her native country again decades later. Sioux leader Tatanka Iyotake - Sitting Bull - is one of the most famous Native American chiefs in history. Did you know he spent a few years as a refugee? In 1877 he fled to Canada, almost a year after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as Custer\\\\\\'s Last Stand. In 1881, he returned to the US, was taken prisoner, and later returned to a reservation. Like his colleague Vedad Ibisevic of Hertha Berlin, Bundesliga soccer player Neven Subotic - who has just signed for K?ln from Dortmund - fled the war in Bosnia as a child. Well aware of hardship, Subotic in 2012 created a foundation to help give people in the poorest parts of the world access to clean water and sanitation. Author: Dagmar Breitenbach\\'\\n \\'DW: Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov declined to offer a mandate to form a new government to the main opposition party, the Social Democrats. Previously, the conservative leader and former premier Nikola Gruevski, had failed to form a government. How do you evaluate the president\\\\\\'s role in the current political crisis? Gudrun Steinacker: I find it deplorable, because he does not anwer the question what else there is to do and how to overcome the present situation in the country. So the only other solution would probably be new elections, which would mean another few months of total stagnation. That would be an expensive choice for a small country like Macedonia: Organizing elections so often is very difficult. [Editor\\\\\\'s note: The last vote in December was held as part of a European Union-brokered deal between Macedonia\\\\\\'s main political parties aimed at ending a long-running political crisis. At the elections in December, Gruevski\\\\\\'s conservative party VMRO-DPMNE secured 51 seats in the 120-seat parliament - only two more than the Social Democrats.] The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed the West was trying to destabilize Macedonia. \"The goal is obvious - to deal with Macedonian politicians unwelcome-by the West\", it stated at the end of last week. Do you agree with Moscow that conservative leader Gruevski is \\\\\\'unwelcome\\\\\\' by the West? Gudrun Steinacker, former German ambassador to Macedonia and Montenegro Of course his reputation is severely damaged due to the wiretapping affair, which has not been clarified yet. We have to see what the special prosecutor will finally come up with. We know how often she is being attacked by media organizations close to the-VMRO-DPMNE, which is not acceptable in my view. She should have a chance to do her job. During my time as an ambassador, I did not see that Russia was really playing a constructive and-positive role in Macedonia. And I\\\\\\'m a little amazed at the relatively new interest of Russia in Macedonia. I\\\\\\'m not sure whether the Russians are really taking into account that this is a fragile, ethnically and religiously very mixed country. I have the feeling that the Russian government is either not aware of this, or that it doesn\\\\\\'t take it into account sufficiently. And finally, I don\\\\\\'t see what Russia is offering the country and the region. Many politicians in Brussels and Berlin seem to be tired of the Macedonian crisis. Do you see any danger that the EU and Germany, who obviously have to deal with much bigger problems such as Trump\\\\\\'s presidency, the Brexit and the refugee crisis, could give up on this small Balkan country and accept any solution that might guarantee its stability - even at the expense of democracy?- It is difficult to predict what is going on in Brussels. There is a-certain fatigue with regard to the crisis in Macedonia and to the situation in the Balkans, particularly regarding EU enlargement: That was even an argument used by Western and German politicians in their dialogue with regional elites, with the message - \\\\\\'You have to make more efforts towards reforms\\\\\\'. I could imagine that there is a certain fatigue, but on the other hand, I think the crucial people who are dealing with Macedonia are aware that they cannot give up on the country and that they have to stay involved. But there are also different positions in different EU countries and I see a problem for the EU to find a common stance on what to do-and how to do it.- Do you think the EU is doing enough in Macedonia and in the Balkans? As someone who has been involved with the Balkans for so many years, it is my personal view that there is not enough involvement, although we do a lot for the Balkans in particular terms: economic support, support for the reforms etc. But perhaps we should rethink the methods and instruments that we --the EU or Germany-- are using-and adapt them more to the problems of the region so that we can see real progress and not only progress on-paper. What could be the solution for the Macedonian crisis-in your opinion? I think we should ask, in the foreseeable future, for all the claims of wrongdoing and even criminal acts to be investigated.-I would not exclude anyone. And all those who are under investigation should refrain from taking political positions until we know what actually happened. It is still very unclear what happened in many cases. I would like to mention, for example, the case of the young people who were killed in Smilkovci [in 2012]. These are cases that put a strain on relations between the different ethnic groups in the country. Macedonia will only survive as a liberal, democratic country, a homeland for all its citizens, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.- Gudrun Steinacker was Germany\\\\\\'s ambassador to Macedonia from 2011 to 2014.\\'\\n \\'link I want to preface this by saying there is no \"Planet X\" IMO as pertains to the views of such a planet that many on this board hold. However, I have always felt there was a massive missing planet as we could never satisfactorily explain perturbations of a planet like Jupiter and the movement of outer objects. The view that there is a missing massive planet has always been on the table and NASA has always supported the idea and never stood in the way of people trying to find proof of it. We know planets, often many, orbit stars in this outer region, why should we be different? Link: Planet X Overview, Source: NASA Caltech researchers have found evidence suggesting there may be a \"Planet X\" deep in the solar system. This hypothetical Neptune-sized planet orbits our sun in a highly elongated orbit far beyond Pluto. The object, which the researchers have nicknamed \"Planet Nine,\" could have a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbit about 20 times farther from the sun on average than Neptune. It may take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to make one full orbit around the sun. But this is all from January you might say, quite old and possibly already discussed. Fast forward to my news feed for today and what do I find? Narrowing the field for the 9th planet Batygin and Brown\\\\\\'s work narrowed down the planetâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s possible mass and orbit to areas where previous observations might have missed it. Their calculations suggest that it has a mass between five to 20 times that of Earthâ\\\\x80\\\\x94a figure that is key to knowing the approximate size of the object they are looking for. They also suggest that its orbit is likely tilted about 30 degrees compared to the plane of the solar systemâ\\\\x80\\\\x94the relatively thin, flat zone in which the eight major planets orbit. They also propose that the planet is now likely near its farthest point from the sun, in the sky\\\\\\'s northern hemisphere, and that it likely has an elongated orbit averaging between 380 and 980 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. (One AU is the average distance between Earth and the sun.) We are on the virge of finding a very real planet in our outer solar system.

The biggest piece of proof has turned out to be the very tilt of our solar system from the perspective of the inner planets. Bailey and her colleagues ran computer simulations that suggest that the tilt of the eight official planets can be explained by the gravitational influence of Planet Nine \"over the 4.5-billion-years-ish lifetime of the solar system,\" Bailey told Space.com.

Khamenei reportedly told the commanders: \"We however thank this new guy in the White House, since he largely did the job we had been trying to do in the past decades: to divulge the true face of the US. We had been working to show the world the depth of corruption in US government and ranks and files of the ruling elite; Trump did it in few days after coming to the White House.\" He added: \"Their claims to human rights are no longer tenable.\" Khamenei also made an apparent reference to the five-year-old son of an Iranian mother who was detained at a US airport following Trump\\\\\\'s ban on visas for seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. According to Iran\\\\\\'s official news agency, IRNA, the Ayatollah said: \"Presently, too, by embarking on such actions, like putting handcuffs on a five-year-old kid, he [Trump] is demonstrating the reality behind the American human rights.\" Khamenei\\\\\\'s comments come amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US since Trump became president. The travel ban and sanctions enacted by the Trump administration, coupled with missile testing by Iran, have contributed to the deteriorating relationship. Concerns have been raised over the future of a deal, brokered by the Obama administration, that requires Iran to heavily restrict its nuclear program. On Saturday, a day after the Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions over an Iranian ballistic missile test, US Defense Secretary James Mattis called Iran \"the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\" Two days earlier, Trump had tweeted that \"Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE\" and should have been \"thankful\" for the \"terrible deal\" brokered by the Obama administration. He declined to rule out military action against Iran. But a senior Iranian adviser to the Ayatollah, Ali Akbar Velayati, dismissed Trump\\\\\\'s remarks as \"baseless ranting.\" And this is not the first time that the Ayatollah has spoken in such terms about the US President. In November, during the election race, Khamenei lambasted both Trump and Hillary Clinton for revealing what he called the moral shortcomings of the US.\\'\\n \\'Halfway down a market street in Canterbury sits a van selling Bratwurst. \"Everyone goes mad for German sausage at the Christmas market,\" vendor Geoff Richardson told DW, \"so we thought we\\\\\\'d do it all year around.\" Not that a love of Bratwurst equated to political Europhilia. Voters in the historic Kent-city were almost evenly split between those in favor of leaving the European Union (51 percent) and those against (49 percent). Although last June\\\\\\'s referendum was a yes-no question, voters addressed a kaleidoscope of issues. The Leave campaign urged people to \"take back control\" on issues such as immigration, borders, over-stretched infrastructure, unpopular directives from Brussels, long-winded bureaucracy, or the cost of EU membership. Reasons cited by remainers - with less passion until it was too late - included regional stability and solidarity, upholding human rights directives, maintaining access to immigrant labor-or financial markets or the fear of the unknown. Many Brits feel their country has bitten off more than it can chew by opting to leave the EU A divided Britain? Dr Chris Moreh, a Research Fellow at the Center for Population Change at the University of Southampton, said the vote had brought to surface divisions that had developed during \"at least the previous decade or so,\" and seemed to have legitimized certain forms of prejudice and hate speech against migrants and judges (who were vilified by the right-wing press for ruling that the government could not trigger Article 50 --declaring the intention to withdraw from the EU --without the authorization of Parliament). \"The UK certainly feels more divided after the Brexit vote [and] any perception of increased division has real social circumstances,\" Dr Moreh told DW. During the public debates on Brexit in the coming years, \"citizens and EU nationals may very well feel that the country is becoming less welcoming, less tolerant of differences in opinion, and overall more divided.\" Indeed, David Isaac, chairman of the state-funded Equality and Human Rights Commission, told MPs last month that he feared a fresh increase in religiously or racially motivated hate crime-against EU citizens in Britain when Article 50 is triggered, as was the case in the two months after the vote. In many cases the Brexit vote split friends and families So just how divided has Britain become? Canterbury in Kent had a high voter turnout (75 percent) and a close-run 51-49 split among Leavers and Remainers. Most people DW spoke to said they had had heated discussions on social media and with friends, family or colleagues about it, but these had passed. Two friends interviewed together, Rory Edwards and Elliot Hawkins, hadn\\\\\\'t known that they had voted differently from the other. Richard Board, who voted to leave while his wife voted to remain, said that the referendum had not caused a rift but it had just got people engaging with politics again. Only one interviewee, pro-Leave John Luckie-Downe, who works in corporate finance in Bahrain, said he had lost a friend over Brexit. Some expressed frustration with segments of the electorate. Kevin Burdett, a retired civil servant, had little sympathy for \"youngsters [who] couldn\\\\\\'t be bothered to vote\" and were \"moaning\" about the result. Kelly, an administrator who declined to give her surname, said she was \"angry\" with Leavers who only listened to emotive immigration rhetoric. Hamish Dowlen, who works in financial services in the City of London and has clients across the EU, lamented a lack of understanding by some Leavers of the \"crucial relevance of the EU within our complex economy.\" He blamed politicians and schools for failing to communicate the importance of Britain\\\\\\'s relationship with the EU. Analysis by the BBC this week found that education levels, then age, were key measures in determining how someone voted. Polls have suggested some Leave voters regret their decision.

Charity worker Catherine Parker foresaw advantages to \"getting rid of EU bureaucracy\" while Chris Ball, 19, a drama student disappointed by the falsehoods peddled by the Leave campaign, said: \"Now we just need to get on with it [while] maintaining a stable relationship with the EU --if that is possible.\" Is it possible? The Guardian asked last week, after the publication of the Government\\\\\\'s White Paper on Brexit, \"What if there is no deal?\" and quoted a Tory MP as saying \"we have set sail in a very stormy situation.\" Such pessimism was far from the older leavers of Canterbury. \"I don\\\\\\'t care if we get a bad trade deal, we can make our own way,\" retired Lynn Fielding told DW, adding \"We like to be Europeans, but outside of Europe.\" Kevin Burdett said he was looking forward to-increased trade with countries such as India and China. Board, a professional landlord in Canterbury facing tax increases from Brussels, told DW he was \"absolutely confident Britain could get a good trade deal --trade barriers were last century; it\\\\\\'s essential now for all nations to be able to trade freely, we all recognize that.\" Greg Mayn fears that Britain will be out of its depth in future trade deals However, Greg Mayne, a tax consultant who voted to remain, was less sure, arguing: \"We don\\\\\\'t have the expertise to negotiate trade deals, we haven\\\\\\'t done so for 40 years.\"-Dowlen, in more apocalyptic language, feared that leaving the EU was tantamount to being herded \"off the economic cliff edge into the abyss.\" Resentment between leavers and remainers could sink back beneath the surface, given that the latter have no Nigel Farage-like figurehead to agitate for them. But the test of cohesion will be seen in the experience of EU nationals and levels of hate crime over the next months and possibly years.\\'\\n \\'Same people all the time , i dont know how you can fix this corruption http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/10_09_01_krongard.html\\'\\n \\'The \"74 year old senator from Vermont\" would fit in 1917 Russia, but not America 1776.

It was only spotted in Africa last year but has already left a trail of destruction which is threatening food security in many parts of southern Africa. The pest targets maize, sorgum, soya beans, groundnuts and potatoes. Zambia says 124,000 hectares (306,000 acres) of-its crops have been destroyed. In December 2016, the-country ordered the national air force into action to control the plague.- In a statement last week, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said \"preliminary reports indicated the possible presence (of the pest) in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\"- Essential for food security in large parts of Africa, maize is particularly vulnerable to the larvae of the fall armyworm, which attack the crop\\\\\\'s growing points and burrow into the cobs.- Jan-Hendrink Venter: \"It\\\\\\'s prone to the prevailing winds and can migrate large distances\" South Africa says it is still assessing the damage but three of the country\\\\\\'s nine provinces have been hit. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana said they had positively identified fall armyworm in samples collected in Limpopo province. Zokwana said his department was registering pesticides for use against the fall armyworm as \"no pesticide was previously registered to be used against it.\" He also told local radio on Tuesday he was convinced pesticides would be able to contain the outbreak. Regional response The minister also stressed that South Africa would be taking part in an FAO meeting in Zimbabwe\\\\\\'s capital Harare next week to draw up an emergency response to the threat.------------ He said the Department of Agriculture \"realized that trans-boundary pests and diseases, especially migratory pests, threaten food security. Regional efforts are important to address these risks, to ensure that early warnings of these biological threats are in place.\" Countries with confirmed outbreaks can face import bans on their agricultural products-because armyworm is classified as a quarantine pest. A Zimbabwean farmer inspects his crop of maize which has been hit by armyworm Mathew Cock, chief scientist at the UK-based Center for Agriculture and Biosciences International, said outbreaks could cause devastating losses and mounting debts for famers.- The fall armyworm from the Americas is also harder to detect and eradicate than its African counterpart -Jan-Hendrink Venter, a plant scientist with South Africa\\\\\\'s Department of Agriculture, told DW-it was-spreading fast. \"We are used to the common African armyworm. This is something new. It has a life cycle of 24 to 40 days. It\\\\\\'s prone to the prevailing winds and can migrate very large distances. A rural farmer in Limpopo province, who identified himself as Willi, says he belongs to a group of neighboring farmers who are extremely worried. He\\\\\\'s concerned that the government might take care of commercial farmers and \"forget us small farmers in rural areas so we might end up losing the whole crop.\"-------- -\\'\\n \\'\"Monument,\" a memorial created by the Syrian-German artist Manaf Halbouni, was unveiled Tuesday in the city of Dresden. Designed to draw attention to the Syrian war while appealing for peace and humanity, the memorial consists of three buses erected on their sides beside the Frauenkirche church in Dresden\\\\\\'s central Neumarkt square. Halbouni, who was born in Damascus to a German mother and Syrian father, said the idea behind the public art piece came from a powerful image that was seen worldwide in 2015: Residents of Aleppo put-bombed-out buses on their sides in the heart-of the formerly thriving industrial city to protect themselves from sharpshooters. The buses became a symbol of the resistance movement in the town which, by the end of 2016, had been nearly totally destroyed by war. The 12-meter tall sculpture was installed next to the restored Frauenkirche In Dresden, the sculpture is comprised of three outdated public buses. The artist said he intentionally uses buses that had not been wrecked, as a-symbol-of the peace that can still be found in Germany --unlike in Syria. The Kunsthaus Dresden, a sponsor of the project, said that the artwork creates \"a connection between the people of the Middle East and Europe and our shared destinies\" and symbolizes-\"the suffering and unspeakable losses as well as the hope for reconstruction and peace.\" A symbol of peace and forgiveness The monument was unveiled Tuesday-in an opening ceremony that was loudly protested by members of the right-wing nationalist party AfD and the Pegida movement. Dresden\\\\\\'s Mayor-Dirk Hilbert-is under protection due to death threats he received for his approval of the 12-meter-tall (over 39-foot) sculpture. He was loudly booed as he attempted to give a speech celebrating the work. \"The right-wing populists, not only in our city but also across Europe, are building themselves up by forgetting,\" said Hilbert. That\\\\\\'s why, he told the crowd at the opening, \"Monument\" is so important. Artist Manaf Halbouni came up with the idea as a memorial to the destroyed city of Aleppo On display in the city through April 3, the installation was funded through donations from the local community. The artist said he-found it important to show that there is a side to Dresden which stands in contrast to the anti-foreigner movement that has become associated with the city. Halbouni, who studied art in Dresden and has had works displayed in London\\\\\\'s Victoria and-Albert Museum as well as at the 56th Bienniale in Venice, said the location of the installation is one of great meaning. It was chosen not only because of the artist\\\\\\'s connection to the city, but also because of the history of Dresden, which-was completely destroyed in World War II. More than-25,000 people died during-three nights of Allied bombing in February 1945. The restored Frauenkirche serves as a symbol of peace and forgiveness after war. ct/kbm-(AFP, dpa) -\\'\\n \\'Angela Merkel\\\\\\'s brief visit to Warsaw on Tuesday marked the German leader\\\\\\'s first trip to Poland since a populist government was elected there-in 2015.-Relations between Berlin and Warsaw remain largely positive, however,-with trade between the two countries booming. The trip has been widely seen as a chance for the two nations to nurture the improving diplomatic relations. Following a 60-minute talk with Merkel, leader of the governing-Law and Justice (PiS) party Jaroslaw-Kaczynski said there was a \"good atmosphere.\" Kaczynski, a politician deeply distrustful of Germany, once-said the chancellor\\\\\\'s goal was to make Poland subordinate to its western neighbour. Merkel meanwhile called-on Poland\\\\\\'s right-wing government to protect the rights-of the political opposition as well as those of the justice system,-trade unions and media, amid an investigation by the EU-Commission-into possible Polish violations of the rule of law. Russia sanctions In separate talks with-Polish Prime-Minister Beata Szydlo, Merkel addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The chancellor later told reporters that-sanctions against Moscow over the ongoing conflict Ukraine-cannot yet be lifted. \"The situation on the ground is still unacceptable,\" she said. Merkel\\\\\\'s comments came just hours after a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which she urged Putin to-use his influence on separatists in eastern Ukraine to bring an end to almost three years of violence. The two agreed, however, on the need for new ceasefire efforts. Angela Merkel and Beata Szydlo stressed the importance of German-Polish ties Poland against Nord Stream 2 Despite being largely on the same page-when it comes to Russia,-the controversial Nord Stream 2-project-remains a contentious issue between Poland and Germany. Reiterating her country\\\\\\'s stance on Tuesday,-Szydlo said the Baltic Sea pipeline is \"not acceptable to Poland.\" The-deal would see-Russia\\\\\\'s state controlled energy giant Gazprom extend its pipeline to-Germany, bypassing-Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine.

While Poland and Germany both favor-stronger security at EU borders, Merkel said-she was \"cautious about demands for EU treaty change.\" The German chancellor also warned against \"exclusive clubs within the EU.\" Trans-Atlantic relations Two weeks into Donald Trump\\\\\\'s presidency in the US, Merkel also addressed comments made by the newly-inaugurated president on Monday in which he said the US \"strongly supports\" NATO.

Trump\\\\\\'s most recent remarks regarding the trans-Atlantic alliance were a far cry from those made prior to his election in which he dismissed NATO as \"obselete,\" sparking concerns that he would seek-to withdraw the US from the alliance. NATO defense ministers are due to meet with-US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis-for the first time next week, and again at the Munich Security Conference a week later. During a phone call last month, Mattis told his German counterpart Ursula von der Leyen that the US was committed to the NATO alliance and US-Germany relations. ksb/rt (Reuters, dpa)\\'\\n \\'When it comes to culinary delights, our eyes want to feast too, and that also impacts our shopping habits. When we hit the produce department at the local grocer, we always grab the most appealing specimens. This aesthetic expectation leads to food waste and makes us oblivious to mother nature\\\\\\'s diversity. \"Supermarkets and grocery chains only offer fruit and vegetables that look uniform,\" explains Anna Strejcov¨¢, spokeswoman and co-founder of the Czech initiative Zachra¨¾ j¨ªdlo (Save the Food). \"Retailers claim that consumers won\"t buy anything else.\" About 20 percent of crops in the Czech Republic, and up to 30 percent in German, are kept from our plates as a result of norms that determine the size, shape and color of fruit and vegetables. \"But since food doesn\"t always grow uniformly, it has to be sorted,\" says Strejcov¨¢. And this sorting often happens right on the fields during harvest time. It wasn\"t originally a question of aesthetics that led to this idealization of cucumbers, apples, and the like, but the fact that uniformly shaped produce takes up less space when stored and transported. Retailers developed internal norms, as did the EU with its often-cited \"bendy cucumber\" directive. But blaming the latter for produce uniformity does not sit well with Amelie Mertin of the German Querfeld initiative. \"What many people don\"t know: the EU \"bendy cucumber\" directive has not been in effect since 2009.\" A flexible leek can become many kinds of dinner. It just needs a chance. It is a vicious circle. Consumers are conditioned to buy straight cucumbers because supermarkets will not stock anything else, which in turn does not allow customers to become (re)accustomed to different shapes and sizes \"?or perhaps they don\"t even remember they exist. \"We must educate the public. Demand it, buy it.\" Amelie Mertin urged. She takes this topic very personally. As a business student, she worked at organic farms during semester breaks and was shocked to hear about the amount of food that goes to waste. \"Many people don\"t even know how much we throw away.\" In Germany alone, roughly 18 million tons of groceries are squandered annually, enough to fill 450,000 transport trucks. Veggies with-character Zachra¨¾ j¨ªdlo is also fed up with the fact that we place greater value on appearance than taste. A campaign called Jsem p?ipraven \"?I am ready \"?aims to put to rest the argument that the customer is not prepared to buy non-standard fruits and vegetables. Almost 10,000 Czech supporters have joined the cause since its inception. Querfeld is a product of the Berlin start-up scene and designed to appeal to the public at large. \"We\\\\\\'r not trying to \\\\\\'convert\\\\\\' anybody or wag our finger at consumers, pressuring them to buy our misshapen vegetables,\" Amelie Mertin explained. \"Instead, our campaigns aim to get people excited about our produce.\" Communication is key, so the campaign must be hip and fun. They appeal to the public with vegetables with character, like tomatoes with noses and the huge variety of root vegetables. \"When we make it fun, we reach a large audience,\" says the young woman who started working for Querfeld\\\\\\'s Munich branch in early 2016. ...with a five-headed eggplant. Just a few examples from the Mutato series. The Mutato series consists of thousands of pictures - this is just a small selection. The installation for the World Food Day at the Design-Quartier Ehrenfeld in Cologne (2011). ...also known as a tomato. A collection of different tomato varieties and at the same time the first species of the Cultivar series. An old tomato variety from Greeneville, Tennessee (USA). A tomato variety from the IPK gene bank in Gatersleben found by F. Schwanitz (1957). A beautiful tomato variety found by friends of the photographer in France. Different varieties of the common bean. Author: Klaus Esterluss Zachra¨¾ j¨ªdlo is also playing with the aesthetics of nonconformity. On the Artwall that runs along the bank of Prague\\\\\\'s Vltava River, activists have placed photographs by German artist Uli Westphal-that depict oddly-shaped fruits and vegetables, a theme he has been working on since 2006. Westphal\\\\\\'s exhibition is supposed to show that \"misshapen\" produce is not only delicious, but also visually unique. \"We are pleased when the consumer thinks it\\\\\\'s cool, but that cannot be the extent of it,\" Anna Strejcov¨¢ emphasizes. \"That is why we initiated round table discussions and invited farmers, distributers, experts and representatives from the department of agriculture. We want to tell them which concrete steps can be taken to bring otherwise discarded produce to market.\" All about quality Querfeld has already found one solution: They deliver to business clients such as catering companies and cafeterias who do not care about the appearance of the cucumber before they chop it up. To get to this point, Querfeld had to convince producers and retailers to play along. And that wasn\\\\\\'t always easy. Young city-dwellers promoting a start-up was enough to make farmers a little skeptical. \"It was important that our project was not a one-off campaign,\" Amelie Mertin points out. In the meantime, the relationship between Querfeld and producers has grown strong, although the fledging food saving business can\\\\\\'t always take everything off the farmers\\\\\\' hands. Too big for the shelves, but not for the aspirations of food savers in Germany and the Czech Republic The main priority for both initiatives in Germany and the Czech Republic is to prevent food waste. Regardless of appearance, the quality of the fruit and vegetables must be high. \"It is important to us that the produce be regional and organic,\" Amelie emphasizes. We do not buy and sell old or moldy produce, just food that is optically irregular.\" This reduces food waste, increases profits for farmers, and offers customers an opportunity to get organic produce at great prices.

He admitted to having registered in several cities across Germany under seven different names in order to obtain social benefits. Earlier in January, the northern German city of Braunschweig opened a special commission to investigate over 300 cases of welfare fraud committed by asylum-seekers.

The number reflects a roughly 65 percent increase compared to the previous year, when the total number of new applications stood at 441,899. The number of follow-up applications, however, recorded a decline of 33.3 percent. In 2015, 34,750 second-chance asylum requests were filed with BAMF, whereas in 2016 the number fell to 23,175. Combined, the number of first-time and follow-up applications for 2016 stood at 745,545. In 2015, this number stood at 476,649. So, BAMF recorded a 56.4 percent net increase in the total number of asylum requests in 2016 compared with 2015. The highest number of requests in 2016 were filed by Syrian nationals. According to BAMF\\\\\\'s report, people from the war-torn Middle Eastern state submitted 266,250 of the new applications (36.9 percent). Afghan nationals came in second, with 127,012 (17.6 percent), followed by Iraqis, who filed 96,116 asylum requests (13.3 percent) last year. People from Iran filed 26,426 applications (3.7 percent). Eritreans submitted 18,854 applications (2.6 percent). Albanians totaled 14,853 (2.1 percent), 14,484 people from Pakistan requested asylum (2 percent), and Nigerians submitted 12,709 applications (1.8 percent). Nearly three-quarters of the applications filed in 2016 came from people younger than 30 years old. People aged between 18 and 25 filed 196,853 asylum requests, or about 23.5 percent of the overall total, making them the largest age group. The number of applications for children under the age of 4 stood at 78,192 (10.8 percent). German authorities accepted 433,920 people of the 695,733 applications they decided on in 2016. The overall protection rate for all countries of origin amounted to 62.4 percent. Ranging from vandalism to arson, more than 900 attacks on refugee centers were recorded in Germany in 2016.

Justice Minister Florin Iordache told reporters that he would publish the details of a new, alternative bill to change corruption provisions in the criminal code, although his own ministry later contradicted him, saying the Justice Ministry was not planning to draft such a bill. Prime Minister Grindeanu meanwhile also threatened to fire the justice minister. The rallies have continued especially in the capital Bucharest, where some 250,000 protesters congregated one week after the start of the protests and chanted: \"We don\\\\\\'t believe you;-we won\\\\\\'t give up.\" Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X37S jbh/tj (AP, Reuters)\\'\\n \\'The Parisian concert hall Olympia was filled with thousands of excited fans in May 2014. They were there for Juliette Gr¨¦co, who was already 87 at the time. Everyone was well aware that it might be their last chance to get to see the artist who has been dubbed \"the high priestess of existentialism.\" The grande dame of French chanson showed up on stage, greeted by thunderous applause. For many, it felt like they were meeting a good old friend again. Youth afflicted by World War II Juliette Gr¨¦co was born on February 7, 1927 in Montpellier-on the French Mediterranean coast. Her father, a police commissioner from Corsica, left the family early on. Her mother moved to Paris with her two daughters and became active in the resistance movement against the German occupiers. Juliette and her sister Charlotte were mainly raised by their grandmother in Bordeaux. In 1943, her mother and sister were arrested by the Gestaspo and were deported to the concentration camp in Ravensbr¨¹ck.-Both survived the ordeal until liberation in 1945. Juliette, too young to be deported, was kept for three weeks in the women\\\\\\'s prison Fresnes. Melancholy as a trademark After the end of the war, Juliette started singing in caf¨¦s in Saint-Germain-des-Pr¨¦s. In 1946, she was among the founders of-the cellar club Le Tabou, a famous haunt of French existentialists. Philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre, film director and actor Orson Welles and Berlin film diva Marlene Dietrich were among the caf¨¦\\\\\\'s regulars. Juliette Gr¨¦co was fascinated by the unconventional style and mindset of these new intellectuals. In turn, they were also inspired by the singer. \"Her voice carries millions of poems that haven\\\\\\'t been written yet,\" Sartre once said. He felt that she made people aware of the sensual beauty of words. Gr¨¦co became friends with Sartre and painter Bernard Buffet. Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus also wrote lyrics for her songs, describing the post-war generation\\\\\\'s hunger for life. Juliette Gr¨¦co with Serge Gainsbourg (right) Gr¨¦co had long black hair at the time and-wore black make-up and black men\\\\\\'s trousers. It was her way of demonstrating her affiliation to the existentialists. Her dark voice made her the perfect interpreter of such melancholic songs. She would quickly be celebrated as the \"black muse of Saint-Germain-des-Pr¨¦s.\" \"Black provides space for the imaginary,\" she told the German weekly \"Die Zeit\" in 2015. Multiple lovers Her friendships with poets and intellectuals were more lasting than her love affairs, which she had with both men and women. In her 20s, she had a relationship with jazz musician Miles Davis. \"What do I care what other people think?,\" she\\\\\\'d typically answer to anyone who\\\\\\'d-ask.- She married three times and-had a daughter with her first husband, actor Philippe Lemaire. Her second husband was actor Michel Piccoli. Since 1988, she has been living with her third husband, pianist and composer G¨¦rard Jouannest. Singer and actress: Juliette Gr¨¦co in London in 1965 \\\\\\'The stage is my home\\\\\\' Her songs \"Si tu t\\\\\\'imagines\" and \"L\\\\\\'¨¦ternel f¨¦minin\" became hits at the end of the 1940s. She would also sing some of the chansons of her colleagues, like Jacques Brel or Georges Brassens. She was a celebrated performer in France, Germany, the US and Japan. Gr¨¦co-also obtained film roles, performing for author, filmmaker and painter Jean Cocteau in \"Orpheus\" (1959). Further roles would-follow. To this day, Gr¨¦co feels the words she sings: \"Even if I tell the story of a 16-year-old girl, I believe what I\\\\\\'m singing. I am that girl.\" She manages to do that even at an advanced age. It only requires a lot of energy. Building trust in Germany Her first performance in Germany after the war was in 1959. She initially hesitated to go to the country responsible for her family\\\\\\'s traumatizing experiences. She sang with tears in her eyes that night; she later said she was thinking about the time her mother and sister spent in Ravensbr¨¹ck. After the hesitant start, she kept returning to Germany. She would perform often in Berlin. In Hamburg, the revue \"Marlene\" combined songs by Marlene Dietrich with her own material. She was a guest of honor at the German Schwetzingen Festival. In 2005, she even released an album in German, \"Abendlied.\" Farewell tour Two years ago, the existentialists\\\\\\' muse launched her emotional farewell tour, \"Merci.\" With concerts around the world, she fulfilled the fans\\\\\\' expectations, singing hits such as \"D¨¦shabillez-moi,\" \"Sous le ciel de Paris\" and \"Amsterdam\" by Jacques Brel. Her singing was accompanied by the gestures which became her trademark over the nearly 70 years of her career.

However, in March 2016, she had a stroke and had to cancel her concerts to recover. \"I am not afraid of dying,\" she had previously told \"Die Zeit,\" \"I\\\\\\'m only afraid of having to stop singing. But you have to know when something is over.\" Now celebrating her 90th birthday, she can proudly look back at a remarkable and influential career. -\\'\\n \"Homeless TRUMP Supporter Guards Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Star on Hollywood Blvd page: 1 On Wednesday a violent leftist smashed Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In the recording, Rimi also claimed \"dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,\" a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week\\\\\\'s raid. Trump is using Obama as a security blanket Civilian deaths Reportedly among the dead was the 8-year-old the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late US-born cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a London-based nongovernmental organization, and a Sanaa-based human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. \"When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,\" Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn\\\\\\'t the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi. In the event Rimi wasn\\\\\\'t there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said. Green-lighting the mission was not dependent on al-Rimi being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized. But US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, had strongly disputed that Rimi was the objective of the raid more than a week ago. \"It wasn\\\\\\'t a high-value target mission,\" Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a \"high possibility\" Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an intelligence-gathering operation. \"Anyone found on site would have been taken,\" Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid. The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid Raid missteps Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. On Friday, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid but later pulled them because the video was nearly a decade old. Government officials previously told CNN plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that Trump green-lighted the mission shortly after his inauguration. How Donald Trump\\\\\\'s first military action went from the Obama White House to deadly raid The Pentagon said the battle resulted in the deaths of 14 al Qaeda fighters, including two AQAP leaders. Many observers have considered al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula among the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, branch of al Qaeda since its formation in 2009. Rimi reportedly became its leader following a 2015 drone strike that killed Nasir al-Wuhayshi.\\'\\n \\'The White House late on Monday issued a list of terror attacks over a 28-month period from September 2014 to December 2016, with US President Donald Trump saying that media had failed to cover them properly.- The release of the list came after-Trump continued to accuse the media of deliberately manipulating the news, saying that the press had been minimizing coverage of terror attacks and-playing down the threat posed by the so-called \"Islamic State\" (IS). He stated-that the \"very, very dishonest press\" had \"their reasons\" for not reporting what he referred to as a \"genocide\" at the hands of the terrorist group. The list, which - according to the top US political website \"The Hill\" - was made available to journalists, details cities, months, years, targets, and attackers. However, the document-fails to explain why the White House had assessed these events to be underreported, and how they were all supposedly linked to IS. The Washington Post published the actual list online, which is more than 1,600 words long and features 27 instances of the term \"attacker\" misspelled. \"You\\\\\\'ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it\\\\\\'s happening. It\\\\\\'s gotten to a point where it\\\\\\'s not even being reported,\" Trump told a group of military leaders during a visit to the US Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. \"We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country. We\\\\\\'re not going to allow it.\" Trump\\\\\\'s list includes a number of attacks that were covered internationally, including the December 2016 Berlin attack, the June 2016 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and a string of attacks in Paris in 2015. The list is seen as an attempt to gather support for Trump\\\\\\'s presently frozen executive order imposing a travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Damage control White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later specified that the president\\\\\\'s words were intended to point out that attacks were \"underreported,\"-rather than-\"unreported.\"-Spicer said that the media exaggerated protest while \"an attack or a foiled attack doesn\\\\\\'t necessarily get the same coverage.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that \"foiled attacks\" went underreported Spicer offered no advice, however, on how to go about reporting on a \"foiled attack.\" \"Look, I think the president\\\\\\'s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don\\\\\\'t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,\" Spicer said. White House deputy spokeswoman Lindsay Walters added that \"the real point here is that these terrorists\\\\\\' attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.\" \"If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they\\\\\\'re happening so often - at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around - that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,\" she said. Reporting on the \\\\\\'Bowling Green massacre\\\\\\' The White House\\\\\\'s claims brought back to mind-recent remarks-by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who-said in a recent-interview that news outlets had refused to cover the \"Bowling Green massacre\" - an event which never occurred. Conway later withdrew her comments, saying that she \"misspoke.\" In 2011, two Iraqi citizens had been arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, for trying to send funds and arms to terrorist groups in Iraq; however, there was no violent incident involved. Conway, who famously claimed that \"alternative facts\" indicated that more people had attended Trump\\\\\\'s inauguration than actually did,-had previously made repeated allegations in interviews-that-a \"Bowling Green massacre\" had been-underreported. ss/tj-(AP, dpa) -\\'\\n \\'It\\\\\\'s a tranquil afternoon on the Whitsunday Islands at the southern end of Australia\\\\\\'s Great Barrier Reef. A tour boat sits moored on a thin slice of white sand as snorkelers marvel at coral beneath crystal clear waters. But the boat\\\\\\'s captain, Mike Evans, says these days some visitors have worries on their minds. \"I\\\\\\'ve actually had a few people tell me that they\\\\\\'ve come to see the reef before it\\\\\\'s too late,\" he told DW. \"I tell them that our area\\\\\\'s fine but they are having bleaching problems up north.\" Lost treasure? Last year, there were reports of the largest coral die-off ever recorded at the Great Barrier Reef. The reef\\\\\\'s northern region lost 67 percent of its shallow-water corals in 2016, prompting some media to claim the reef was \"already dead.\" The damage didn\\\\\\'t extend as far south as the Whitsunday Islands. But tour operators in the coastal town of Airlie Beach, where visitors disembark to explore the islands, say more and more people are coming to see the reef before it vanishes. \"I heard that because of the global warming there was degradation of coral reefs,\" Sergi Altadill, visiting from Barcelona, told DW. \"I was thinking this is the moment to come because in a few years there is no more coral reef in this area.\" It isn\\\\\\'t just Australia\\\\\\'s reefs that are under threat. In December, the United Nations Environment Program published a study showing that with current trends, 99 percent of the world\\\\\\'s reefs will suffer severe bleaching annually by the end of this century. Bleaching occurs when the water becomes too warm, causing coral to expel the algae that gives it its vibrant color. The result isn\\\\\\'t just a white hue that disappoints divers-- the-coral is also left-vulnerable to starvation and disease. Modeling the reef\\\\\\'s future Still, behind the UN study was a development that offers some hope. It drew on new high-resolution projections based on global climate models to-predict when and where coral bleaching will occur. In conducting her research, environmental scientist Karen Joyce enjoys a great overview of marine life in the Great Barrier Reef. This photo shows a panoramic view of Heron Island from the west. The flattened, disk-like bodies of two rays are visible in the lower right of the image. Joyce sets the flying robot on a pre-programmed mission. She operates the drone with a remote control and a computer. Photographs taken by the drone can be downloaded after the mission. This drone view shows the southern part of the Heron Reef flat, and open water out to Wistari Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is a collection of different undersea habitats. The picture above shows corals and algae on Heron Island from about 20 meters (66 feet) up in the air - and looks like a piece of art. A live feed of what the drone sees will be sent back to Joyce\\\\\\'s computer - albeit in low resolution. On the left, sharks can be seen swimming in the boat channel on Heron Island. On the right hand side, dense coral is visible. Drone technology offers a great advantage in that it enables Joyce to survey areas that are too difficult or too dangerous to access. This also allows scientists to cover a much larger area than snorkeling or scuba diving would. With the help of drones, scientists are able to get high-resolution information with much greater detail than data provided by satellites. This image shows a highly detailed mosaic of hundreds of individual photos taken by Joyce\\\\\\'s drone above Heron Reef. The Great Barrier Reef suffers from massive coral bleaching. With this phenomenon, corals expel symbiotic algae, turn white and eventually die. Climate change-induced warming of seawater is regarded as one of the main reasons for coral bleaching. Research by scientists like Karen Joyce could shed further light on the mechanisms behind the phenomenon. Author: Oleg K?dding-Zurm¨¹hlen Roger Beedon, director of tourism and stewardship at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, says this opens up new possibilities to use data collected by scientists and tour operators. \"Coral reefs are made up of animals, but they behave a bit more like forests because many of them can live for hundreds of years, and they can lock up a record of what has happened to them during that period of time,\" he told DW. \"They\\\\\\'re a bit like trees. You can look at growth bands within those corals, and you can see how well they were doing each year.\" This information about the past-can be used to model future developments, and combined with current-observations gathered by tour boats.-That-helps focus protection efforts on areas at-risk,-and has-implications for global conservation efforts. \"One of the important things about reefs is they can give us insights about what\\\\\\'s happening at global scale,\" Beedon-says.- Cruise Whitsundays, the largest tour operator in the area, has been participating in a monitoring program called Eye on the Reef since 2007. Tour boats survey the sites they visit regularly and provide data to help manage any impacts they find, including bleaching. Reef outreach Company spokesperson Alyce Carter says the tours also educate visitors about the dangers the reef faces, and dispel exaggerated claims of the reef\\\\\\'s \"death.\" \"What\\\\\\'s missing in media reports is that the degree the reef is affected varies widely from insignificant to severe,\" she told DW. \"It\\\\\\'s the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef that is currently experiencing a major coral bleaching event. That area is approximately 1,590km from our pontoons. People who have lived in this area for more than 20 years have observed that the reef around our pontoons is in the best condition they have ever seen.\" Bleaching happens when algae is expelled from coal, leaving it vulnerable to starvation and disease Not all locals agree. Sandra Williams is a campaigner with the Australian Marine Conservation Society who lives in Airlie Beach. \"I\\\\\\'m fortunate enough to have seen the Great Barrier Reef at its most magnificent best,\" she told DW. \"But I also know that people alive now and those coming in the future will never have the opportunity to see what I\\\\\\'ve seen on the reef, because it is a very different place even now.\" Williams acknowledges that tour operators in the Whitsundays have upped their reef monitoring activity and educate visitors about environmental threats. Treading lightly- \"Many of the boats that go out daily are actively engaged in reporting changes they see to scientists and government bodies to build up that picture of what is happening locally in the marine environment,\" she says. \"People are very engaged and proactive in looking after their patch, and also in trying to shift government regulation and policy to enact better reef protection.\" But she says this isn\\\\\\'t the case with some operators in other parts of the reef. \"They don\\\\\\'t want it publicised that the reef is under threat or that there\\\\\\'s been coral bleaching-because they see an immediate negative impact on their business.\" And tour boats themselves pose a threat to the reef,-both through engine pollution and by scraping the coral surface. Operators like-Cruise Whitsundays are part of an-eco-certification scheme which means they take-precautions above and beyond what is legally required. Tourists board a Whitsundays cruise boat to see southern parts of the reef, which have seen only minimal bleaching The-Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority also restricts their movements with a complex system of-permitting and zoning, which-actively engages tour operators in a communication loop. The authority uses information their boats-gather-to identify vulnerable areas of the reef and restrict activity there. Extreme weather Minimizing damage from tourism is vital given the threat-from climate change. And with extreme weather events happening more frequently, this-is not limited to bleaching. Right now, one of the main concerns for-those protecting the reef is ensuring corals are in the best possible health if and when a cyclone hits. \"We\\\\\\'re now in the middle of our summer period - this is traditionally our cyclone season,\" says Williams. \"For first time in three years we\\\\\\'re actually having a wet season, and I expect somewhere at least once in the coming months, somewhere on the coast, there will be a massive cyclone.\" Williams says if a cyclone hit a northern area like Port Douglas, where two thirds of the coral is already dead,-the impact on what remains-could be devastating.- \"It doesn\\\\\\'t have the resilience to fight back from that.\" -\\'\\n \\'Mohannad Sabbagh deftly whips a copper scoop into the rotating cauldron in front of him, pulling it out loaded with hot salt. \"My body is a thermometer!\" he grins as he dabs his palm lightly on the surface. \"My hand is what measures the temperature.\" Sabbagh, 20, has been roasting cashews, pistachios, chick peas, and melon seeds in exactly this way ever since his father sent him out aged 12 to work at the family roastery near Bab Touma gate in Damascus\\\\\\'s old city.- The cauldron, heated by a dull diesel flame, is not so different from the one his great-grandfather used back in 1913 when he launched his roastery, a Damascus institution that is still going strong today. Some Syrian refugees in Germany have made arrangements to return home voluntarily. DW has spoken to a few of these refugees about the challenges they face. (27.01.2017) Vienna\\\\\\'s Habibi & Hawara restaurant employs a dozen mainly Syrian refugees. But it\\\\\\'s not just a job: The goal is to teach newcomers how to run a company in Austria, reports Matteo Tacconi. (22.10.2016) The challenge of integrating large numbers of refugees from the Middle East is nothing new for Sweden. A dozen years ago, the country opened its doors to Iraqis - with mixed results. Richard Orange reports from Malm?. (21.10.2015) But we are not in Syria. We are in a drab industrial estate on a cold, wet January morning in Malm?, the city in Sweden to which Sabbagh and his brother Moumen fled in December and October 2015 respectively, during the last wave of Europe\\\\\\'s refugee crisis. Together with their old Damascus neighbors Jehad and Mamoun Abo Rokba, the brothers hope to bring a taste of home to the 112,000 Syrians who have fled to Sweden since civil war began five years ago.- \"The Syrians love it! It\\\\\\'s like their dream shop has opened,\" Sabbagh says of Delicious Rosteri, which opened three weeks ago in M?llevaangen Square, the center of the city\\\\\\'s immigrant population, with a dabka folk dance-featuring bagpipes and tambourines.- Lavishly decorated with gold cladding, the shop sells more than 90 varieties of nuts from its wooden drawers.- \"Whoever knows it from Damascus, they will come on the basis of the name. The flavor is known, it\\\\\\'s like a franchise, like IKEA,\" Sabbagh-jokes. - The brothers also hope to serve the rest of the city\\\\\\'s Arab population, and even lure in the occasional Swede. Spurred on by suffering Back at the factory, Sabbagh-pokes his nose over the cauldron and smells the now half-roasted chickpeas, an expression of exaggerated delight spreading over his face.- \"It\\\\\\'s not the flame that roasts the nuts, it\\\\\\'s the hot salt,\" he explains enthusiastically, \"because the seeds will burn if exposed to raw flame or hot metal.\"- The roasting machine, the four spinning barrels used to flavor the nuts, the copper scoop, even the rubber baskets made from old car tires, everything has been shipped from Syria by his father.- Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2TFIN \"All of the ways of making this roastery are \\\\\\'old-school,\\\\\\' because we want the old taste to stay,\" he says. \"We did consider new roasting techniques, but it lacks the flavor. We want it to taste the way it tasted 50 years ago.\"- Once roasted, the nuts must be sold quickly to retain their flavor and nutritional value. Nuts which have sat in storage for months after being imported from Iraq or Egypt quickly absorb moisture and grow a patina of mould.- It hasn\\\\\\'t been easy. Sabbagh whistles and looks theatrically at the ceiling when asked about his month-long journey from Turkey, which began when the boat he joined to cross over to Greece began to sink into the cold December waters of the Aegean.- He was rescued, and then arrested, before making the long overland journey to Sweden, all the time fearing that by the time he got here, the rules would have changed to prevent him from being able to stay.- \"But if it wasn\\\\\\'t for this suffering we wouldn\\\\\\'t have such motivation to start a business like this,\" he smiles. \"It makes us appreciate it more.\" The brothers and their partners are in a hurry. They rented premises and imported the machines within months of arriving in the city, only to discover that Sweden\\\\\\'s authorities didn\\\\\\'t look too kindly on burning diesel with an open flame in an enclosed space.- Getting a license took a frustrating eight months and required installing an expensive ventilation system.- When they went to Almi, a Swedish government bank which funds and advises immigrants starting small businesses, they were advised to give up. \"They said \\\\\\'your project isn\\\\\\'t going to work,\\\\\\'\" shrugs Mamoun Abo Rokba, who worked as a lawyer in Syria before fleeing three years ago, and now handles the business side.\"So I went straight back to the workshop and started to make it happen.\" Local tensions What Abo Rokba and the al-Sabbagh brothers have going for them is the backing of their prosperous Damascus families: The Sabbagh family owns five roasteries, while Abo Rokba\\\\\\'s father runs a company importing medical equipment. This is not unusual for Syrians in Sweden, who are often richer and better educated than the Iraqis who came in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. - The family behind the-Jasmin al-Sham restaurant which opened in the middle of the city\\\\\\'s main pedestrian street last April owned four paper tissue factories in the Syrian city of Homs. They spent hundreds of thousands of euros converting an old branch of Pizza Hut into a replica of a Damascene house. But the perceived arrogance with which Malm?\\\\\\'s newly arrived Syrians splash money around, and the attention-seeking dabka dances they arrange to launch new businesses, generate not a little resentment among established Arabs. - \"There is that sentiment,\" admits Abo Rokba. \"You can feel it. They\\\\\\'re not happy with whatever you started. People tend to forget that we didn\\\\\\'t come here by choice. We were forced to leave Syria.\"- Mohannad Sabbagh and his brother are carrying on a family tradition with Delicious Rosteri But Syrians like him aren\\\\\\'t willing to spend years living on benefits while they study Svenksa f?r Invandrare (SFI, Swedish for immigrants), the slow-moving language program which is the official first step to integration in Sweden.- \"Syrians don\\\\\\'t like to stay at home and wait for things to happen,\" he says. \"SFI doesn\\\\\\'t get you a job. We don\\\\\\'t want to be a burden, we want to be an active part of society.\"- Abo Rokba-has just come back from a business meeting in Austria where he discussed exporting his freshly roasted nuts. He has plans to set up another roastery in Berlin. He is thinking of adding freshly roasted Arabic coffee to the product line. Back at the factory, Sabbagh inserts a metal bucket into the cauldron and chickpeas and salt begin to cascade down a ramp, the chickpeas into rubber baskets, and the salt falling through holes to floor to be used again.- He scoops up a handful of the hot nuts and pours them into my hand.- \"You will taste the flavor of Sham now,\" he exclaims. \"A taste of old Syria!\"\\'\\n \\'What are the threats for kids online? Official advice on internet safety tends to focus on a few main threats. In late 2015, the UK government published measures to keep children safe online at school and at home. It includes \"cyber bullying, pornography and the risk of radicalization\" as major threats. It refers to \"some school children, who travelled or attempted to travel to Syria, were able to access material about Daesh [\"Islamic State\" or ISIS] and foreign fighters via school computers.\" In September 2016, the German government advice listed the same basic threats, but replaced radicalization with the risk of \"gruesome, violent imagery.\" And it\\\\\\'s all true, but a bit vague, to be honest. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), however, dives right into the detail: \"Children may come into contact with demeaning, racist, sexist, violent, hateful or false information.\" The advice is dated October 24, 2016, so it can be safely assumed the reference to hateful and false information has nothing to do with President Donald Trump (or his administration\\\\\\'s tampering of government websites). It then skips over pornography, SPAM containing obscene material, and \"file swapping programs with inappropriate and sometimes mislabeled content,\" before stating that \"most worrisome, children may encounter actual predators that use the internet to identify and lure victims through chat rooms, instant messaging facilities, and social networking sites.\" So what can kids and parents do to surf the net safely? Well, the DOJ says that due to \"first amendment rights to free speech, various types of information can be posted in the web, some of which a parent may find inappropriate for their child(ren) to view.\" It then goes on to recommend parents snoop on their kids, which, on one level, counters that very idea of free speech. But we are talking about protecting kids, so perhaps snooping is the only way, certainly when kids hit those secretive teen years. While you mull that over,, let me give you more from the DOJ. It\\\\\\'ll help you decide. Â° Do not post personal information online or your picture - \"it can be copied, changed or used to find you.\" Â° Do not post your plans and activities in a chat room. Do not post entries that make it clear no one is at your home. And do not use location services - they reveal your location in real-time. Â° Do not communicate with people who make you feel uncomfortable or afraid. This, no doubt, is meant to help you steer clear of cyber bullies. But bullies are predators, and sometimes simply walking away isn\\\\\\'t enough. So what do you do then? Find someone you trust, like your parents or a teacher. Parents, says the DOJ, should ensure their kids\\\\\\' computers are in a public space even in the home. This neatly ignores concealed messaging on smartphones and watches, but you get the idea. It\\\\\\'s also suggested you know your kids\\\\\\' passwords and read through their emails regularly - perhaps also follow them on social media. This is understandable up to a point, but it could have devastating effects on trust within your family. And when that trust is bust, who do you think your kids will turn to? So try talking to your kids before spying on them. And kids, how about you share with your parents before they feel the urge to track you like a troll? For instance, if you come across images that upset you online, talk to your parents. They may not have all the answers, but it\\\\\\'ll be better than keeping it secret. - Amanda Todd, a 15-year-old and cyber bullying victim, called for help in a YouTube video before committing suicide You should also talk to your parents before buying apps or in-app purchases and before joining online groups and games. Involve them, and seek their advice - it\\\\\\'s no reason to be ashamed. Oh, and speaking of shame: Try to avoid sexting.

He\\\\\\'s not likely to instruct Shinzo Abe how to dance the Cotton-Eyed Joe, the way George W. Bush did when Vladimir Putin visited his Crawford, Texas, ranch. Nor is he hoping to replicate the courtside bro-out Barack Obama enjoyed with David Cameron at a March Madness game in Ohio. But in bringing Abe to his ornate southern retreat Mar-a-Lago, Trump is nonetheless continuing a long tradition of presidents melding recreation and negotiation in their encounters with foreign leaders. Trump, who is still seeking his diplomatic footing three weeks into his term, finds himself more relaxed at his oceanfront oasis than in the White House, where he\\\\\\'s lived for less than a month. He hopes the gesture will also put the buttoned-up Abe at ease. \"That\\\\\\'s the one thing about golf -- you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch,\" Trump told a radio interviewer over the weekend. The President has told aides he hopes to use golf and visits to Mar-a-Lago as a way to develop warmer ties with his foreign counterparts, many of whom are approaching his presidency with uncertainty. Trump, who prefers to sleep in his own bed, has expressed little interest so far in traveling abroad, though he\\\\\\'s committed to attending a European NATO summit in May and accepted an invitation from Britain\\\\\\'s Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit this summer. RELATED: Theresa May in trouble over Trump\\\\\\'s UK state visit invite At Mar-a-Lago, Trump is happy to play host. Overlooking the Atlantic on Florida\\\\\\'s Gold Coast, the club is firmly Trump\\\\\\'s turf. On his first trip there as president last weekend, he mingled in the club\\\\\\'s living room with paying members even as a Washington state judge halted his controversial immigration order. Friends say Trump is most relaxed in the confines of his estate -- or playing golf on the courses he owns nearby. \"He\\\\\\'s able to relax on the golf course with people he knows and trusts and likes,\" said Robin Bernstein, one of Mar-a-Lago\\\\\\'s original members, who speaks with Trump frequently when he\\\\\\'s staying in Florida. \"I think that he finds golf kind of his outlet to relax. He loves it, he enjoys it, he\\\\\\'s a fabulous athlete, and that\\\\\\'s what he loves. Some people go fishing -- Donald loves golf.\" In Abe, Trump finds a leader eager to foster a closer bond with the US, particularly given Trump\\\\\\'s tough criticism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Japan was a partner in, and the costs of US security support provided to the East Asian nation. \"This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday after detailing the weekend trip. Abe enjoyed a congenial working relationship with Obama, but the two men never developed warm personal ties. When Abe tried bringing Obama to Tokyo\\\\\\'s best sushi restaurant in 2014, the US president grew restless as the dinner stretched for hours. Abe is hoping to start fresh with Trump, already meeting once with the real estate mogul in November. The pair discussed bilateral ties in Trump\\\\\\'s Louis XIV-style livingroom at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Abe brought along a gold-colored golf driver as a gift. \"I know he loves the game, and we\\\\\\'re going to have a lot of fun,\" Trump said in the radio interview this week. \"I\\\\\\'ll just make sure he\\\\\\'s my partner.\" Trump\\\\\\'s invitation for a weekend at his private club continues a well-established practice of vacation diplomacy for US presidents. His predecessors have acted both as hosts for their foreign counterparts and as guests at vacation spots and golf courses the world over. But no recent president has owned as lavish a getaway home as Trump, or been so eager to show it off. Obama, who maintained a residence in Chicago but rarely visited there himself, employed public properties instead to host foreign leaders away from the White House. Obama invited the new Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Sunnylands estate in Southern California for their first meeting, including a long ramble in scalding desert heat around the grounds. He used Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland\\\\\\'s Catoctin Mountains, to reassure Arab Gulf leaders of his Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Accustomed to more lavish environs, leaders like Saudi King Salman sent top advisers instead. More relaxing were his encounters with Cameron. After Obama flew him to Dayton for the NCAA tournament in 2012, Cameron reciprocated with a round of golf at the Grove Club in Hertfordshire. He was one of the few foreign leaders who joined Obama for golf -- others included the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia. Bush, who swore off golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War, hosted more than a dozen leaders among the scrub brush at his Crawford ranch. His three-day summit there with Putin in 2001 featured line dancing and a barbecue, but little agreement on missile defense. A session with the Saudi King resulted in some awkward photos of the President holding the Gulf monarch\\\\\\'s hand. Bill Clinton used Camp David to try securing an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the end of his term. He wasn\\\\\\'t successful; the wooded retreat proved less inspiring than it had 20 years earlier, when Jimmy Carter brokered a successful peace accord there between Israel and Egypt. Like Trump, Clinton identified golf as an entry point into personal relationships with counterparts. A round in 2000 with Singapore\\\\\\'s Prime Minister in Brunei started late and stretched well past midnight. American leaders aren\\\\\\'t alone in using quieter retreats as a setting for talks. When Obama visited Saudi Arabia in 2014, then-King Abdullah received him at his desert getaway oasis, Rawdat Khurayim, 35 miles outside Riyadh. Trump, too, could soon find himself at another leader\\\\\\'s vacation home when he travels to Britain -- though not necessarily to make him more comfortable. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, suggested this week that Trump\\\\\\'s visit to the United Kingdom may take place at Balmoral, the Queen\\\\\\'s Scotland estate, to evade the expected masses of protesters in London. The palace later tamped down that speculation, noting the Aberdeenshire castle was privately owned by the royal family, and thus unsuitable for a state visit. But of the Queen\\\\\\'s other official residences, two -- Windsor Castle, outside London, and Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh -- would at least move Trump away from the capital.\\'\\n \\'Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc called on the country\\\\\\'s fish-farming industry to boost shrimp exports, state media reported Tuesday. Speaking at a conference in the southern province of Ca Mau, he pushed for $10 billion (9.35 billion euros) in shrimp exports by 2025. \"I urge the sector to earn $10 billion by 2025 and become a major industry of Vietnamese agriculture,\" Phuc said. \"Inadequate high tech for intensive farming has resulted in only modest productivity of 250 to 300 kilos of shrimp per hectare; if productivity is doubled, we can immediately reach our goal.\" TPP uncertainty The prime minister said key to the development of the sector was advanced biotechnology as well as automation plus improvements in packaging and branding. He hoped that investments from commercial banks would help raise shrimp output to reflect 10 percent of GDP eventually. The sector was expected to get a boost from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), whose members accounted for almost half of seafood export destinations. But US President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s withdrawal from the trade deal has left the project\\\\\\'s fate uncertain. The US is Vietnam\\\\\\'s largest shrimp importer, accounting for 23 percent of exports worth $520.2 million in the first nine months of 2016. hg/jd (dpa, AP, vovworld.vn) -\\'\\n \\'Israel has played down comments from the White House cautioning that new settlement building \"may not be helpful\" to the peace process. Israelis still expect US President Donald Trump to be more pro-Israel than Obama. (03.02.2017) Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will build the first new West Bank settlement in over 20 years. Meanwhile, the Trump administration in the US pushed back against further settlements. (03.02.2017) Under a court order, Israeli security forces have begun to evacuate the unauthorized Amona settlement, despite resistance from residents. Hours earlier, the government unveiled plans for 3,000 new settlement homes. (01.02.2017) The law, which passed by a vote of 60 to 52 on Monday night, retroactively legalized about 4,000 settler homes built on privately-owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. The legislation applies to 53 outposts and homes within existing settlements, according to the anti-settlement organization Peace Now. But analysts said its passage may only be largely symbolic as it contravenes Israeli Supreme Court rulings on property rights. Israel\\\\\\'s attorney-general has warned the law is unconstitutional and that he will not defend it in-the country\\\\\\'s top court. Palestinians furious In response to Monday\\\\\\'s vote, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) slammed the new law as-a means to \"legalize theft\" and demonstrated \"the Israeli government\\\\\\'s will to destroy any chances for a political solution.\" Under international law, the Israeli settlements are illegal and are seen by most countries as an obstacle to the peace process. But Israel disputes this and cites biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs. A PLO statement stressed that the \"Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the two-state solution.\" Ahead of the vote, opposition chief and Labour leader Isaac Herzog lashed out against the \"despicable law\" that he said would undermine the country\\\\\\'s Jewish majority. Israeli ministers divided The legislation has raised tensions in the government, with political sources telling news agencies that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately opposes the bill. He believes it could provide grounds for prosecution by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. But right-wing members of his government demanded the legislation proceed in response to last week\\\\\\'s forced evacuation by the Supreme Court of 330 settlers from the Amona outpost, also built on private Palestinian land. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu missed the vote as he was in London to meet British leader Theresa May The far-right Jewish Home party paid tribute to US President Donald Trump who has signaled strong support for Israel, in contrast to the Obama administration, which refused to veto a United Nations resolution denouncing Israeli settlements in December. Since Trump took office, Israel has confirmed it will build more than 6,000 new homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, seen as key parts of any future Palestinian state. The UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov, warned in a statement that the law \"will have far reaching legal consequences for Israel and greatly diminish the prospects for Arab-Israeli peace\". mm/jm (AFP, Reuters)\\'\\n \\'University of New Hampshire scientist Dacheng Lin and his team noted a black hole has been eating at a star-since July 2005 and is still going. This is the longest known event of a star being devoured by a black hole. \"We have witnessed a star\\\\\\'s spectacular and prolonged demise,\" said Lin in a statement. \"Dozens of tidal disruption events have been detected since the 1990\\\\\\'s, but none that remained bright for nearly as long as this one.\" The observation was noted Monday in the Nature Astronomy journal. The astronomic event is taking place in a host galaxy 1.8 billion light years away. According to the Chandra X-ray Observatory, NASA\\\\\\'s flagship telescope for detecting x-rays around the universe, the black hole, also known as XJ1500+0154, is located in the center of the host galaxy, the expected location for a supermassive black hole. Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of almost all large galaxies in the observable universe. The XJ1500+0154 black hole emitted its greatest x-ray brightness in June 2008, and has since reduced in brightness. The data also indicates the radiation surrounding the black hole has surpassed the so-called Eddington limit, a balance between the outgoing pressure of radiation from hot gas and the inward gravitational pull of the black hole. The limit explains the luminosity of black holes. \"For most of the time we\\\\\\'ve been looking at this object, it has been growing rapidly. This tells us something unusual --like a star twice as heavy as our sun --is being fed into the black hole,\" said co-author James Guillochon from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The black hole is expected to continue eating away at the star for several more years to come. kbd/jm (AP) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2RFo6\\'\\n \\'Between 5,000 and 13,000 people were executed in the Syrian military prison at Saydnaya between 2011 and 2015, according to a report published on Tuesday by rights group Amnesty International (AI). The majority of the victims were civilians who had denounced the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Amnesty said. The report, entitled \" Human slaughterhouse: Mass hangings and extermination at Saydnaya prison, Syria\" was corroborated with 84 witness and expert accounts, including prison guards, former prisoners, judges and lawyers. \"Between 2011 and 2015, Saydnaya saw mass executions that came to total around 50 people per week,\" AI\\\\\\'s General Secretary in Germany, Markus N. Beeko, said, The executions were reportedly authorized by the Syrian government, with military tribunals taking just minutes-before prisoners-were sentenced to death. Thousands more people are-reported to have died through torture and inhumane treatment. \"These major systematic violations in human rights mean that we are dealing with cases of crimes against humanity,\" Beeko said. \"These crimes cannot go unpunished; they must be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC).\" If this route is blocked by the UN Security Council, then individual member states should do all they can to make sure that these crimes are answered for, Beeko added. Syria has been rocked by bloody civil war since 2011, which has seen more than 310,000 people killed and millions more displaced. dm/jm-(AFP, dpa) In 2011, as regimes crumble across the region, tens of thousands of Syrians take to the streets to protest against corruption, high unemployment and soaring food prices. The Syrian government responds with live ammunition, claiming some 400 lives by May. At the urging of Western countries, the UN Security Council condemns the violent crackdown. The EU and US implement an arms embargo, visa bans and asset freezes in the months that follow. With the backing of the Arab League, calls eventually grow for the Syrian president\\\\\\'s departure. But not all UN members agree with this demand. Bashar al-Assad - who has been in power since the death of his father in 2000 - sees his reputation wane with the continuing unrest. He refuses to end decades-long emergency rule, which allows for surveillance and interrogation. Russia backs its ally, supplying weapons and vetoing UN resolutions on Syria multiple times. By the end of the year, human rights groups and the UN have evidence of human rights abuses. Civilians and military deserters are slowly beginning to organize themselves to fight back against government forces, which have been targeting dissidents. More than 5,000 have died so far in the fighting. It will take another six months before the UN acknowledges that a war is taking place on Syrian soil. In September 2012, Iran confirms that it has fighters on the ground in Syria - a fact long denied by Damascus. The presence of allied troops underscores the hesitance of the US and other Western powers to intervene in the conflict. The US, stung by failed interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, sees dialogue as the only reasonable solution. As the death toll nears 100,000, the number of refugees in neighboring countries - such as Turkey and Jordan - hits one million. That number will double by September 2013. The West and the Arab League have seen all attempts at a transitional government fail in the two years of war, watching as fighting spills over into Turkey and Lebanon. They fear Assad will stay in power by any means possible. Assad has long claimed he\\\\\\'s combatting terrorists. But it\\\\\\'s not until the second year of war that the fragmented Free Syrian Army is definitely known to include radical extremists. The group Al-Nusra Front pledges allegiance to al Qaeda, further splintering the opposition. In June 2013, the White House says it has evidence that Assad has been using sarin nerve gas on civilians - a report later backed by the UN. The discovery pushes US President Barack Obama and other Western leaders toward considering the use of military force. However, Russia\\\\\\'s proposal to remove the chemical weapons ultimately wins out. Reports of a new jihadist group calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) emerge in the final weeks of 2013. Taking land in northern Syria and Iraq, the group sparks infighting among the opposition, with some 500 dead by early 2014. The unexpected emergence of IS ultimately draws the US, France, Saudi Arabia and other nations into the war.

His words echoed sentiments made by Germany\\\\\\'s interior minister.

The rescues come as EU leaders adopt controversial measures in cooperation with Libya. (04.02.2017) A plan to keep migrants from crossing the Mediterranean Sea has been agreed on by EU leaders at their Malta summit. Rights groups warn the policy will confine asylum-seekers to inhumane conditions in Libya. (03.02.2017) The Libyan camps where traffickers hold would-be migrants resemble concentration camps, German diplomats say. Their report comes as the EU mulls a migration deal with the North African country. (29.01.2017) Gabriel, who is Germany\\\\\\'s Foreign Minister and also Vice Chancellor, was skeptical about deporting migrants from Italy, where over the past year most migrants have landed in Europe, back to Libya because of the country\\\\\\'s chaotic political situation. \"We believe Libya is a very unstable place,\" he told reporters on Monday while in Brussels for-talks with his European counterparts, to implement a deal thrashed out last week by EU leaders in Malta. Gabriel\\\\\\'s comments contradicted those made by another senior member of his Social Democrats (SPD),-Thomas Oppermann, who heads the-party\\\\\\'s parliamentary group. Oppermann had argued in the-Sunday edition of the German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,\"-that if migrants were returned to Libya, it-would help-curb human trafficking. Ten-point plan On Friday, EU states agreed a 10-point program to assist Libya to reduce the migrant flow, including funding and training for the Libyan coastguard. Leaders also vowed to help set up safe refugee camps in the North African country, after human rights groups criticized existing camps for their inhumane conditions. The bloc will also increase support for those who voluntarily return home from Libya, an EU statement said. Germany Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his EU counterparts for the first time since taking up the job last month Ministers also urged Libyan authorities to step up efforts to protect migrants, especially those held in detention centers. They condemned reports of migrant abuse by people smugglers, and called \"on all parties to ensure unhindered and secure access to the centers for aid workers.\" \\\\\\'Send them back\\\\\\' Austria\\\\\\'s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said the bloc needed to learn from the Australian example, which until recently turned away refugees arriving by boat. The \"most important rule\" had to be that if anyone set off illegally towards the EU, they would be sent back at the bloc\\\\\\'s external borders. Some 180,000 refugees, most of them from Libya, landed in Italy last year. Over the weekend, some 1,500 migrants were rescued after their rickety boats got into trouble, the Italian coastguard said. Italian and Spanish rescue teams launched nine different operations to pick up the migrants from vessels in the central Mediterranean off Libya. Last week, Libya said it had intercepted more than 1,100 migrants on inflatable and wooden boats off its coast.

(21.12.2016) The head of Germany\\'s intelligence agency has said authorities received a tip in September that \\'IS\\' was planning an attack. Bomb plot suspect, Jaber A., was detained after police found explosives in his apartment. (11.10.2016) Bristol police used the stun gun after mistaking the man for a wanted criminal suspect. Video footage showed him refusing to give his name to police outside his home. (20.01.2017) Police officers in Berlin will run a three-year test phase of using Taser-guns in threatening-situations. The city-state will be the first in Germany to roll out a trial phase of the divisive weapons, which until now-were only available to special police units and federal police forces in charge of domestic security issues. Units in the districts of Mitte and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg have provided training to 20 officers on how to employ Tasers in dangerous situations. Further officers are expected to receive the same training in due course. The German capital is on high alert following a terror attack in December 2016, in which a truck was used to kill 12 people attending a Christmas market. The city is planning to introduce other-measures as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its security setup, including increased video surveillance. Shoot on sight? The use of firearms will continue-to be allowed alongside Tasers.-However, authorities hope that the roll-out of Tasers will reduce the use of guns, offering this technology as part of non-lethal alternatives such as pepper spray and tear gas to combat attacks. Technically, however, Taser-guns remain subject to state laws governing the use of firearms by police.- A similar pilot project is reportedly planned for the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, starting in March 2017. The state of Hesse is also considering the use of Tasers. The contentious weapons are intended to give Berlin police officers more choice in how to react when facing danger A deadly weapon Tasers, also known as stun guns, deliver a powerful and painful electric shock, rendering an attacker unable to move for a number of seconds. The modern weapons are intended to allow police officers to use this time to apprehend a suspect without sustaining injury themselves. Tasers have, however, come in for criticism-for causing the deaths of a number of people, including-former Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson in the UK last year - one of eleven deaths linked to the use of Tasers by the police in the UK alone. London police are-currently examining whether officers-wish to expand the use of a potentially deadly weapon in the face of the ongoing threat of terror across Europe. ss/rt-(dpa, epd, AFP)\"\\n \\'The two most important elements of these provisions - known as the convergence criteria - concern fiscal discipline, mandating member states to limit their annual budget deficits to less than three percent of their respective economic output while instructing them to hold their national debt to under 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Germany was the driving force behind the inclusion of these provisions in the agreement, even though the \"three-percent rule\" on budget deficits had originally been conceived by a young French official. Guy Abeille, a low-ranking employee in the French finance ministry, was tasked in 1982 to come up with a way to control the problem of runaway fiscal deficits, a product of then French President Francois Mitterrand\\\\\\'s expansive spending policies. The French government\\\\\\'s budget deficit at the time roughly amounted to 2.6 percent of GDP. Abeille therefore was of the view that a one percent ceiling on the deficit would be unrealistic; even adhering to a two percent ceiling would be an onerous task for the government. That\\\\\\'s why he suggested a three percent upper limit, and the simple and arbitrary manner in which the rule came into being. It was then later incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty as an important criterion that has to be met by potential member states to join the European monetary union. The rule on keeping the level of national debt below 60 percent of GDP was arbitrary, says Oliver Sivering Arbitrary decisions Even the rule on keeping the level of national debt below 60 percent of GDP was arbitrary, says Oliver Sievering of the College of Public Administration and Finance in the southern German city of Ludwigsburg. In the early 1990s, many countries\\\\\\' debt levels were around 60 percent of GDP. The two figures were then intertwined to come up with the debt and deficit rules, Sievering told DW. \"If the economy grows nominally by five percent, the new debt may rise by three percent. And this was used as the basis for coming up with an upper limit on debt of 60 percent of GDP.\" But it quickly became clear that achieving an annual growth rate of five percent was far from realistic. It was also evident that countries like Belgium, Italy and Greece wouldn\\\\\\'t be able to meet the 60 percent target. As a result, one had to just take comfort from the fact that the debt situation of these countries was moving in a positive direction and focus on the three-percent-deficit target.- A convergence report published in 1998 by the European Monetary Institute shows that except for Greece, all other potential eurozone candidates showed a fiscal deficit of less than three percent of GDP. Fresh eurozone economic data show that inflation has risen to just below the ECB\\\\\\'s key target, growth is accelerating and unemployment has hit a seven-year low, suggesting the bloc\\\\\\'s economy is finally on the mend. (31.01.2017) An adviser to President Trump says the euro served as a currency for Germany alone, allowing it to \"exploit\" its EU partners and the US. Is it worthwhile to confront this nonsense with facts? asks DW\\\\\\'s Rolf Wenkel. (02.02.2017) A poll by an investment consultancy has shown that more investors than ever consider a breakup of the eurozone likely in the next 12 months. Italy\\\\\\'s woes are in focus, but it\\\\\\'s not the only potential trouble spot. (29.11.2016) Hans Tietmeyer held a major leadership role in two of Germany\\\\\\'s most important transitions in recent memory: Reunification and the introduction of the euro currency. His passing has been confirmed by the central bank. (28.12.2016) Some countries, including Germany, resorted to a number of tricks to show that they complied with the requirement. For instance, the German government sold shares in firms like Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Post to the state-owned development bank KfW, in a bid to show that it reduced its debt level. Italy, meanwhile, introduced a European tax on its citizens only to repay most of it after the introduction of the euro. Not a good example The two Maastricht criteria are meant to be respected even after entering the eurozone club, to guarantee the solidity of the currency and the monetary area. Germany, in particular, has always insisted on their compliance. However, Europe\\\\\\'s largest economy, together with France, violated the deficit limit in 2002, and yet both Berlin and Paris managed to avoid paying billions in fines and softened the strict rules. \"Since then, it has been quite detrimental to budgetary discipline in the euro area, as it gave a chance to other countries to say: if Germany and France do not adhere to the criteria, why should we stick to them?\" noted Sievering. At the height of the financial crisis, almost all countries exceeded the budget deficit target.- Although most eurozone countries have managed to rein in their deficits, they still have a long way to go when it comes to their debt. In 2015, for example, it was only Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Luxembourg whose debts were below the 60 percent threshold. While Germany recorded a budget surplus again in 2016, its national debt was hovering around 70 percent of GDP, way above the prescribed limit. Although the Maastricht criteria have been violated innumerable times, no penalty has so far been imposed on any violator. \"No one wants to impose a fine on the other, because every country knows that in a few years it could face a similar situation and would be glad if it were let off the hook,\" underlined Sievering. In other words, potential perpetrators judge current culprits. Despite the ineffectiveness of the compliance mechanism, Sievering views the rules as indispensable. He points out that just paying attention to the criteria and discussing-them has-a disciplining effect. -\\'\\n \\'on October 30, 2016 2:24 pm Â· \\\\nOne thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s people try to say he doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nConway immediately went on defense, saying, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwow.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting â\\\\x80\\\\x98JEW-S-Aâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as â\\\\x80\\\\x98deplorable.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 She responded: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe â\\\\x80\\\\x94 I hope youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been to Trump rallies and I hope that youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nTapper went on to say that no, he isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conwayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand on this one: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. \\\\nMr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Tapper continued. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe just has. He says things like, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 But he has never serious said, â\\\\x80\\\\x98I donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 He has never seriously done it.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nConway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nNo, Kellyanne, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a sign that Trump is winning. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s one of them.

Search\\'\\n \\'DW: Mr. Bozkurt, your party colleague and Social Democrats (SPD) boss Thomas Oppermann wants refugees who are pulled out of the Mediterranean-returned to North Africa as a way of stopping trafficking. What is wrong with this plan? Aziz Bozkurt: This is, at the very least, legally questionable. It is a fundamental principal of international law not to send back those whose lives and freedom are in danger. Under international law, you can\\\\\\'t pull people out of the Mediterranean and then return them to unstable countries. What Oppermann is suggesting is neither realistic nor doable, same as other Social Democrats have said. It has been suggested before and, like spoiled milk, the idea does not get better with time. Oppermann said that refugees should receive \"initial care in North Africa.\" That sounds like asylum requests can be reviewed there. It is fine to find legal paths. However, we have to see which countries we\\\\\\'re dealing with. Libya, for example, is more than unstable, as Foreign Minister [Sigmar] Gabriel said again today. Then there are countries like Morocco or Tunisia. Conditions there are basic, yet even there we cannot guarantee legal procedures will be carried out to our standards. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere plans to establish a reception center in Tunisia. What is wrong with checking asylum cases there? The SPD\\\\\\'s Aziz Bozkurt It\\\\\\'s that those people are in large part already in European waters, making Europe responsible for the secure and legal handling of asylum procedures. This is also an attempt to push these people out of sight - out of sight, out of mind. That is unacceptable. Asylum cases should be processed here, when the situation calls for it. We cannot avoid the problem. Is closer cooperation with North African countries for you the wrong way to better control the flow of refugees? Of course. We have to work with countries that are safe. It is not our intention that people take dangerous routes and cross the Mediterranean. Thousands died that way last year. What can the German government do to give people less incentive to take that risk? Thomas Oppermann already made some good suggestions - increased foreign aid, for example. Germany gives 0.5 percent of GDP to foreign aid. It will be 0.7 percent soon, and that is already something. Development aid is especially important when you consider how the movement of refugees has been stoked the last few years, for example due to reduced aid to refugee camps in Lebanon. That was also European policy. We have to find legal paths, too. Oppermann has already made immigration policy a talking point, such as migrant work. Elsewhere, there is our cooperation with UNHCR, which opens up the possibility for legal paths for refugees. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X346 Is Oppermann\\\\\\'s statement, which sounds more like a CDU position than an SPD one, testing the election campaign waters? Domestic security will presumably be an overriding topic. I don\\\\\\'t really believe that. Oppermann\\\\\\'s comments certainly were not approved, rejected by (SPD chancellor candidate) Martin Schulz\\\\\\'s circle, and met with resistance throughout the party. Seeing that this was a one-off comment, I hope it was not an attempt at rebranding on the part of Oppermann at the expense of the SPD, as someone ready to become interior minister in the image of Otto Schily (who served in the position under Gerhard Schr?der from 1998-2005 and was known for his hard-line, law-and-order stance). To reiterate: It was an isolated opinion and not the consensus of the SPD. Aziz Bozkurt is the chairman of the SPD working group on migration and diversity. The interview was conducted by Volker Wagener.\\'\\n \\'There aren\\\\\\'t many members of the Sioux tribe living in Bavaria, but, thanks to the tentacles of international finance, the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) being built near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation-in the US-have reached-the streets of-Munich. Last week, protesters from an alliance of NGOs arrived on the doorstep-of the BayernLB bank to deliver more than 700,000 signatures. They had been-collected via worldwide petitions against DAPL\\\\\\'s-17 financial investors, including the Bavarian state bank, which is contributing $120 million (111 million euros)-of the total $2.5 billion cost.-More than 220,000 signatures were on a petition specifically aimed at BayernLB, though that figure had almost-climbed to 300,000-by-Monday 6. Despite an invitation from environmental campaigners Urgewald, BayernLB-declined to send any representatives outside the building to receive the petition. \"But we were allowed to go in with a delegation of three people, and we gave the petition to the press spokesman,\" said Regine Richter, banking specialist at Urgewald. The bank itself is unwilling to give interviews on the subject, and in response to DW\\\\\\'s request would only send the public statement it issued in December, which had made many conciliatory noises. \"BayernLB is following the running discussions about the route of the pipeline very carefully and, as part of the consortium financing the pipeline, supports an amicable result of the discussions between the parties,\" it read. Wait and see BayernLB added that it was waiting on a report from the US law firm Foley Hoag,-commissioned in December to look into how the local indigenous people had been consulted on-the project. That report is due out later this month, but it may come too late, because within days of taking office-in January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order decreeing that the environmental review for the project be fast-tracked. \"Nobody is really sure that means, but we are concerned that DAPL could get the green light any day now,\" Nick Pelosi, corporate engagement director for the campaign group First Peoples Worldwide, told DW.-\"It\\\\\\'s such an urgent matter at this point that we really don\\\\\\'t have time.\" Not only that,-Pelosi is also concerned that the study is being conducted behind closed doors and may be no more than a desktop-assessment. \"From what we understand, it is a study on tribal consultation, which is the crux of this issue - that the tribe was not consulted properly about this pipeline,\" Pelosi said. \"But nobody\\\\\\'s reached out to the tribe, so it\\\\\\'s essentially a study on consultation without any consultation.\" All 17 banks insist that the loans for DAPL-are now legally committed. \"But some have shown concern and that they are willing to exert the limited influence that they have,\" Pelosi said. \"I definitely think they\\\\\\'re feeling the pressure,\" he said. \"But what the tribe is asking is not necessarily for the banks to pull out, but to use their influence as project lenders to pressure the company into rerouting to avoid their treaty territory.\" The banks\\\\\\'-influence appears to be very limited indeed.-They argue that they can\\\\\\'t impose new conditions on the loans and that it isn\\\\\\'t their role to determine the route. \"Which is true - it\\\\\\'s the US government\\\\\\'s responsibility - but we\\\\\\'re asking them to support the reroute, not dictate it,\" Pelosi said. Dozens of protesters have been arrested at the Standing Rock reservation Passive bank Compared with other banks, BayernLB has been particularly recalcitrant. \"BayernLB was one of the few that outright rejected our request for dialogue,\" said Pelosi. \"BayernLB is being much too passive,\" Richter said. \"Banks like the Dutch ING and the Norwegian DNB are at least expressing public criticism of the pipeline consortium\\\\\\'s behavior or are selling stakes in the companies involved.\" Meanwhile in Germany, BayernLB\\\\\\'s involvement in the project has raised some political hackles - firstly because it is partly owned by the state, and secondly because it received a colossal taxpayer-funded 10-billion-euro ($9.3-billion) bailout during Europe\\\\\\'s financial crisis in 2008. \"BayernLB should not be allowed to support the dirty business of climate denier Donald Trump,\" said Anton Hofreiter, the Greens\\\\\\' parliamentary leader and a native of Bavaria. \"This project destroys the environment, is a risk for the drinking water from the Missouri River-and-at the same time-desecrates the Native Americans\\\\\\' cultural heritage.\" Hofreiter, along with other German politicians, is sure that BayernLB\\\\\\'s commitment to the project could be reversed by Bavaria\\\\\\'s state government. \"I\\\\\\'m sure it\\\\\\'s possible,\" Frank Schwabe, Bundestag member for the Social Democrats, told DW. \"The bank has oversight committees, and there is political influence on that, so it would be good if the politicians in Bavaria would take a clear position on it. We\\\\\\'re discussing the issue of company and bank responsibility more and more, and I think that a state bank in particular needs to stick to that.\"\\'\\n \\'Donald Trump\\\\\\'s US presidential victory made clear to Poland how dire its geopolitical situation is. Media are shifting ever more attention to neighboring Germany. On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel will make a brief, but appointment-packed visit to Warsaw. \"The Merkel of last resort: Poland and Germany are bound to each other,\" wrote \"Tygodnik Powszechny,\" a Roman-Catholic weekly based in Krakow. Poznan\\\\\\'s weekly, \"Wprost,\" calls the relationship between the two countries a \"marriage of convenience,\" with photographs of the chancellor in a near embrace with Jaroslaw Kaczynski. You may be interested in reading this: Merkel officially nominated as candidate for Chancellor The chancellor\\\\\\'s trip is an in-kind gesture after last year\\\\\\'s Berlin visit by Beata Szydlo, the Polish prime minister. Merkel also plans to meet with President Andrzej Duda, opposition leadership and representatives of Poland\\\\\\'s German-speaking community. Her most important meeting is with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling-national-conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS). It is their first face-to-face in years - the invitation coming from the Polish side, German officials said. Kaczynski is Poland\\\\\\'s political kingmaker. Focused first and foremost on his so-called \"conservative counterrevolution\" at home, he has not left Poland for either private or political reasons in years. Instead, he has invited select foreign leaders and policymakers to visit ever since his party came to power at the end of 2015: presidents of Ukraine, the French foreign minister and high-profile members of Donald Trump\\\\\\'s circle.

Trade between the two countries hit 100 billion euros in 2016 ($107 billion). Defense cooperation is for the most part good. Russia policy is also on the same page, apart from the Baltic Sea pipeline. Regional disagreements are mounting. The European Union has filed suit against Poland on account of its government\\\\\\'s handling of the rule of law. Berlin has not publicly commented on the feud, looking to avoid a \"bilateralization\" of an EU-level matter. Talks in Warsaw will center on the future of the EU and migration policy. Poland is looking to tweak membership obligations in favor of member states, something Berlin rejects. \"If we start with one country, it opens a Pandora\\\\\\'s Box,\" said one German diplomat. Berlin and Warsaw are in agreement on more strongly securing EU borders and countering the causes of refugee movement. How that may affect the situation within the EU remains an unanswered question. The German government hopes for a \"fair sharing of the burden\" of refugees, a position that circumvents many countries\\\\\\' continued opposition to refugee resettlement and at most means a sharing of the financial burden. In late 2014, with the war in Syria approaching its fourth year and Islamic State making gains in the north of the country, the exodus of Syrians intensified. At the same time, others were fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Niger and Kosovo. Vast numbers of Syrian refugees had been gathering in border-town camps in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan since 2011. By 2015, with the camps full to bursting and residents often unable to find work or educate their children, more and more people decided to seek asylum further afield. In 2015 an estimated 1.5 million people made their way on foot from Greece towards western Europe via the \"Balkan route\". The Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel within much of the EU, was called into question as refugees headed towards the wealthier European nations. Tens of thousands of refugees were also attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean on overcrowded boats. In April 2015, 800 people of various nationalities drowned when a boat traveling from Libya capsized off the Italian coast. This was to be just one of many similar tragedies - by the end of the year, nearly 4,000 refugees were reported to have died attempting the crossing. Countries along the EU\\\\\\'s external border struggled to cope with the sheer number of arrivals. Fences were erected in Hungary, Slovenia, Macedonia and Austria. Asylum laws were tightened and several Schengen area countries introduced temporary border controls. Critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\\\\\'s \"open-door\" refugee policy claimed it had made the situation worse by encouraging more people to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe. By September 2016, Germany had also introduced temporary checks on its border with Austria. In early 2016, the EU and Turkey signed an agreement under which refugees arriving in Greece could be sent back to Turkey. The deal has been criticised by human rights groups and came under new strain following a vote by the European Parliament in November to freeze talks on Turkey\\\\\\'s potential accession to the EU. With anti-immigration sentiment in Europe growing, governments are still struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the continuing refugee crisis. Attempts to introduce quotas for the distribution of refugees among EU member states have largely failed. Conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere show no signs coming to an end, and the death toll from refugee sea crossings is on the rise. Author: Rachel Stewart Points of clarification A lack of concrete ideas from Poland makes cooperation especially difficult for Berlin. A pan-European military is a prime example, an idea both Kaczynski and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have now and then thrown into the mix. It remains unclear what the Visegrad Group - Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary - actually want. Poland\\\\\\'s government has its reasons to view Brexit and Trump differently than Germany\\\\\\'s does. Both pose problems for Germany, which could allow Poland - with its government\\\\\\'s lukewarm stance towards the EU - a chance to \"strengthen its position and significance,\" writes the political scientist, Olaf Osica, in Tygodnik Powszechny. The Polish political establishment takes umbrage with the \"[German] inability to accept other points of view, based on its steadfast conviction in its own universal policies\" believed capable of solving nearly every problem in the world. Citing a number of policy differences - migration, energy, climate and the Eurozone among them --Osica concludes that these are \"independent of the party in power\" and have been openly debated only since the change in government. It is hoped that the-meeting with Merkel will be a \"serious conversation about serious topics and the defining of common interests.\"\\'\\n \\'He has got to go after him , he is the one causing al the trouble around the worl and is 100% proof that what Trump says about crooked and corruption is true .

Trump told enlisted service-members at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that attacks were happening \"all over Europe\" and that \"it\\\\\\'s gotten to a point where it\\\\\\'s not even being reported.\" \"And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn\\\\\\'t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,\" Trump added. Later, the White House distributed a list of the attacks Trump was citing, saying \"most did not receive adequate attention.\" \"Below is a list of 78 major terrorist attacks targeting the West that were executed or inspired by ISIS since September 2014, soon after the terror group declared its caliphate. Most of these attacks did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources,\" a White House official said on background, when distributing the list. But reporters in print, on air and on social media have robustly covered many of those attacks and terror in general. \"As a journalist I\\\\\\'m really troubled by that,\" Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said on CNN\\\\\\'s \"The Lead\" on Monday, responding to Trump\\\\\\'s initial statement. \"We have brave colleagues who everyday are taking big risks to cover these stories. Look at The New York Times, which the President demonizes often. The New York Times this weekend had an outstanding piece of reporting about how ISIS has been reaching out, is more involved in some attacks in Europe and abroad,\" he said. Ignatius said he has about 100 examples of strong reporting he\\\\\\'d like to show the President. CNN\\\\\\'s Anderson Cooper also highlighted his coverage of many of the events listed. \"Not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list the White House has released, we covered them heavily. I know because I was there on the ground reporting a number of them,\" he said Monday night, before showing footage of himself reporting from Ottawa, Canada, in 2014; Paris in November 2015; San Bernardino, California, in 2015; in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He added: \"To be sure, we as a program did not cover each and every incident on the list, however other programs, as well as CNN International covered most if not all of them, many of them exhaustively.\" The attacks listed span from September 2014 to December 2016, and include the Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin, the Brussels airport attack, the Istanbul airport and Sultanahmet attacks, and the Sydney siege. But the White House only mentions attacks that appear to have been carried out with Islamist motives and omits other terror operations. It does not mention the recent attack on a mosque in Quebec City, or the racially motivated attack by Dylann Roof on a church in South Carolina, in which nine black worshipers were shot dead. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters after Trump\\\\\\'s statement that the President \"felt as though members of the media don\\\\\\'t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn\\\\\\'t necessarily get the same coverage.\" Trump has used terror attacks to justify his controversial temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the US. He has also repeatedly referred to media organizations critical of him as \"fake news.\"\\'\\n \\'The Bavarians were held at home by Schalke on Saturday but extended their lead at the top of the table to four points after RB Leipzig\\\\\\'s loss. Despite their league position and seven points from nine since the return from the winter break, Ancelotti\\\\\\'s side have faced their fair share of criticism from both the media and fans. And ahead of Tuesday\\\\\\'s-game, which sees the previous two winners of the German Cup clash at Allianz Arena, Germany\\\\\\'s number 1 admitted that some of that talk is justified. \"Things that have always been our trademarks like pace and accurate passing aren\\\\\\'t working the way we\\\\\\'d like at the moment,\" he said. Neuer\\\\\\'s feelings were echoed by Philipp Lahm, who said \"it\\\\\\'s clear we want to play better football.\" Lahm, who made his 500th competitive appearance for Bayern when he came off the bench against Schalke, said the team needed to improve against Wolfsburg and with a Champions League last 16 tie with-Arsenal -just around the corner. \"There\\\\\\'s nothing at all wrong at the moment, but the players have to be aware that we can\\\\\\'t play the way we did in the last three matches over the next few weeks,\" the club\\\\\\'s skipper-said. Wolfsburg, who beat Bayern on penalties in the 2015 final, have somewhat deeper problems. Valerien Ismael\\\\\\'s side are just three points clear of the relegation play off spot and lost to Cologne at the weekend. But Ismael is a believer in the old adage that the form book goes out the window in Cup games. \"The Cup has it\\\\\\'s own laws,\" he said on Monday.-\"We are going into the game confidently and will look to take our chance.\" mp (DPA/Reuters)\\'\\n \\'Can Lotte hit the jackpot again?

The tiny club from Germany\\\\\\'s north-west were in the regional leagues until last year but have already seen off Bundesliga heavyweights Bayer Leverkusen and-Werder Bremen. The 10,000 capacity Frimo Stadion is sure to be rocking once again on Wednesday for the visit of 2nd division 1860 Munich. The Bavarians, who made a high profile appointment earlier in the week, have struggled for consistency this term and lost again at the weekend. A division may divide the teams but there are only 11 places between them in the league pyramid. The home side will fancy their chances of making the last eight. Who will Tuchel pick? Thomas Tuchel\\\\\\'s team are still fighting on three fronts A win over a Leipzig and suddenly things are looking up again at Dortmund. Their inconsistency in the Bundesliga means Thomas Tuchel\\\\\\'s side can all but write off the title for another year and also means the Champions League seems an unlikely goal. Which leaves the German Cup. BVB squeaked through in the last round, requiring penalties to see off Union Berlin. In that match, Tuchel fielded a side peppered with fringe players and almost paid the price. Making the same move against Union\\\\\\'s city rivals Hertha would be a bold move. Pal Dardai\\\\\\'s side are solid and fit and the Hungarian coach has said he\\\\\\'s looking to take the match in to extra time. Tuchel must balance his desire for fresh first teamers with the hunger for silverware. Contrary to the normal thought process, perhaps the Bundesliga game against doomed Darmstadt on Saturday is a better opportunity to rest players ahead of the resumption of the Champions League, against Benfica, on February 14. Will -struggling mid-table trio take it seriously? The cup is Gladbach\\\\\\'s best chance of success in 2016/17 The same questions of priority-apply to a host of the Bundesliga\\\\\\'s mid-table sides. Schalke may have their own European adventure but they \"?along with Borussia M?nchengladbach and Wolfsburg \"?must see the German Cup as their only chance of glory in seasons that have been various shades of-underwhelming. Wolfsburg have a daunting task when they visit-Bayern Munich on Tuesday-but Schalke (away to Sandhausen on Wednesday) and Gladbach (away to Greuther F¨¹rth on Tuesday) will both expect to progress. This underachieving trio all finished in the Bundesliga\\\\\\'s top 8 last term, they all look relatively safe from relegation (though Wolfsburg must still look over their shoulders)-and Europe seems a long shot. A cup exit and many fans will feel their season is over before the end of February. Can Hannover prove their Bundesliga credentials? Hannover were relegated from the Bundesliga last season Two of last season\\\\\\'s underachievers meet in Hannover on Wednesday and both have turned their form around. Hannover were wretched in finishing bottom of the Bundesliga-last term but have bounced back to top Bundesliga 2, while Niko Kovac\\\\\\'s Eintracht Frankfurt are third in the top tier after surviving in the relegation play off last time round. For Hannover this is a chance to prove they belong back at the table while the Eagles will want to maintain their momentum as the business end of the season approaches.\\'\\n \\'Indians went to the polls on Saturday, February 4, in the first two of five state elections that experts say are a major popularity test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The premier\\\\\\'s approval ratings have dropped since his controversial move in November last year to scrap high-denomination currency notes, dubbed locally as \"demonetization.\" Weeks after Modi announced the-drastic move to withdraw all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation, the monetary situation in Asia\\\\\\'s third-largest economy has yet to normalize and most people across the country continue to face problems accessing cash for their daily needs. The government has said the move will bring billions of unaccounted money into the formal banking system and clean India\\\\\\'s economy of \"black money,\" a term used in the country to refer to unaccounted, untaxed wealth. But since the announcement, serpentine queues have lined up outside banks and ATMs of people replacing their rupee notes or making small withdrawals. And Modi\\\\\\'s administration has faced sharp criticism over the slow pace of introducing the new notes, with banks running out of cash and ATMs having to be recalibrated to cope with the different sized bills - a process that is still incomplete. The Indian government\\\\\\'s recent surprise decision to ban all high-value currency notes in circulation has affected almost everyone in the country. Economist Rajiv Biswas talks to DW about the effectiveness of the move. (24.11.2016) One of the world\\\\\\'s fastest growing economies is projected to experience a slowdown in the current fiscal year. India\\\\\\'s economy is forecast to grow by 7.1 percent, which would be its slowest rate of growth in three years. (06.01.2017) India wants to go digital and cash becomes outdated overnight. Prime minister Modi certainly wants to do the right thing. But with the demonetization move his calculation just doesn\\\\\\'t add up, writes Katja Keppner. (02.12.2016) Months after India\\\\\\'s PM Narendra Modi shocked the nation with an abrupt high-value banknote ban, hitting the country\\\\\\'s economic growth, the government has announced a plethora of sops to ease the pain. (01.02.2017) The Indian economy\\\\\\'s high reliance on cash only adds to the crisis. Furthermore, many in the South Asian nation lack proper access to banks and financial services. The uncertainty caused by the shock decision has also led foreign investors to withdraw huge amounts of capital from the country and put it elsewhere. The resulting slide in the rupee has sparked speculation that the country\\\\\\'s central bank may intervene to shore up the currency. Crucial elections The state elections are being held against this backdrop.-The five states, where the votes are taking place, are home to a fifth of the country\\\\\\'s 1.25 billion-strong population. While the voters in the western states of Punjab and Goa cast their ballots on Saturday, polls will be held in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the north and Manipur in the northeast between February 11 and March 8. As predicted by political analysts, the demonetization controversy has dominated the crucial state elections. Opposition parties are trying to use the currency controversy to their advantage as the rural population in the states has faced the brunt of the premier\\\\\\'s demonetization decision. In the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, farmers are finding it difficult to buy pesticides for the winter crops. \"It is a serious issue as cash scarcity has affected vast swathes of India\\\\\\'s rural hinterland. If the objective of the demonetization move was to target the rich, it has not been effective,\" Vinod Singh, a-farmer from Uttar Pradesh, told DW. The election in Uttar Pradesh is crucial for Modi given its enormous significance in Indian politics. Being the most populous state in the country, with over 200 million inhabitants,-it elects the highest number of lawmakers to both houses of Indian parliament. Modi\\\\\\'s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 73 out of the state\\\\\\'s 80 Lok Sabha - the lower house of parliament --seats in the 2014 general election, a stunning performance that helped the party secure an absolute majority for the first time. Experts say India\\\\\\'s abrupt demonetization \\\\\\'seems completely silly\\\\\\' - But it won\\\\\\'t be an easy ride for the BJP in the state-level polls this time around, warn-experts. The electoral alliance between the regional Samajwadi Party and the Congress party has given a boost to BJP\\\\\\'s-opposition. In Punjab, the chances of the Aam Aadmi Party-(Common Man\\\\\\'s Party), an outfit campaigning against corruption, securing victory are pretty sound. Several polls following the weekend vote indicate that the party, which has a government in Delhi, could win the Punjab state election. \"It was an election of hopes. People have high hopes, and we will together fulfill those hopes,\" Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP chief, said after the vote. If the BJP performs well in this crucial round of state polls, analysts believe it would be interpreted as an endorsement of PM Modi\\\\\\'s policies. A defeat could force the party to reconsider its strategies. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X52r -\\'\\n \\'1. How many films are being shown? The 67th Berlinale, which runs from February 9-12, 2017, presents a total of 399 films. The number of showing is much higher as many of those films are being shown multiple times. Over one quarter of the films on the agenda were directed by women. 2. Is there one overarching theme? No. There are several themes that dominate the various programs. Some of them focus on the fate of refugees, such as the in-competition contribution of Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurism?ki, \"The Other Side of Hope.\" Also this year, the Berlinale, in keeping with its long tradition of focusing on political topics, is presenting numerous documentaries. As 2017 is the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution, some of the contributions deal with political utopias. The section \"Panorama\" shows films on homosexuality, as well as African films and films dealing with racism.- Aki Kaurism?ki\\\\\\'s \"The Other Side of Hope\" is vying for a Gold Bear Even though it\\\\\\'s been all over the news, the name \"Donald Trump\" wasn\\\\\\'t mentioned at all during the Berlinale\\\\\\'s opening press conference. \"Our program in itself is already a strong form of protest,\" responded Berlinale director Dieter Kosslick when asked how the festival would be responding to the new US president. 3. Which stars will be there? This year, Hollywood actors including Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke, Cillian Murphy and Robert Pattinson will be making appearances. The female stars that\\\\\\'ve marked Berlinale in their calendars tend to be from Europe, such as C¨¦cile de France, Pen¨¦lope Cruz, Catherine Deneuve and Kristin Scott Thomas. Australian stars Geoffrey Rush and Hugh Jackman, as well as German actors Nina Hoss, Moritz Bleibtreu, August Diehl, Bruno Ganz and Hanna Schygulla are also expected. 4. Which German films are being shown? This year, German films are strongly represented with 104 works shown in various program sections, as well as three films in competition by Volker Schl?ndorff, Thomas Arslan and Andres Veiel. In addition, young German filmmakers will be shown exclusively in the series \"Perspektive Deutsches Kino\" (Perspective on German film). Thirty-six German films will run in the section \"Lola\" which caters to foreign film distributors. 5. Which international highlights can be expected? Expectations are high for some films in the competition including works by-Aki Kaurism?ki (Finland), Agnieszka Holland (Poland,) Sally Potter (Britain,) Hong Sangsoo (South Korea) and Alex de la Iglesia (Spain,) as well as US filmmakers James Mangold and Oren Moverman. Josef Hader appears in his own film, \"Wild Mouse\" Also drawing a lot of attention are two films directed by actors, namely American Stanley Tucci and Austrian Josef Hader. The works of big-name directors will be shown in other sections, including James Gray, Raoul Peck, Fernando Trueba, Bruce LaBruce and Romuald Karmakar. The Berlinale also offers a platform to new discoveries and lesser-known filmmakers that have promising careers ahead of them.- 6. Which program series are particularly-important? In addition to the competition and the well-established series \"Panorama\" and \"Forum,\" the section \"Generation\" tends to draw crowds. Many Berlinale fans love this part of the festival as it\\\\\\'s-directed towards very young audiences. But there\\\\\\'s also something in store adults. The section \"NATIVe\" shows films focusing on indigenous peoples in northern Europe. \"Kulinarisches Kino\" (Culinary cinema) not only shows works on food and the environment,-but also invites audiences to actually sit down and enjoy a real bite.-Finally, the \"Berlinale Shorts\" fascinates short film fans.- 7. What does the Berlinale contribute to cinema history? Traditionally, the Berlinale also takes a look back at the past. This time, the historical retrospective is devoted to the science-fiction genre with both well-known newer films from Eastern Europe and Asia. The series \"Berlinale Classics\" presents restored historical works that haven\\\\\\'t been viewable in original for a long time, among them Helmut K?utner\\\\\\'s \"Schwarzer Kies\" (Black gravel) and the Mexican film \"Canoa.\" The digitally upgraded zombie classic \"Night of the Living Dead\" is likely to give viewers the creeps this year. 8. Does the film festival also present TV series? The awards will be presented on Saturday, February 18 Yes, watching entire series has become a tradition at the Berlinale. This year, viewers can look forward to \"4 Blocks\" by Marvin Kren featuring Berlin\\\\\\'s drug and clan scene, as well as \"SS-GB\" by Philipp Kadelbach, which is set in a fictional Britain where the Nazis were victorious. Historical film fans can enjoy Rainer Werner Fassbinder\\\\\\'s innovative 1972 TV series \"Eight Hours Are Not a Day\" in its restored version. 9. Where are the films shown? Throughout the entire city. The festival\\\\\\'s focal point is Potsdamer Platz, where the in-competition films are shown every evening. Other traditional locations are old movie theaters like Zoopalast and Delphi in the western part of the city. The \"Berlinale Goes Kiez\" section brings movies to local Berlin neighborhood cinemas. 10. Which awards can be won? Golden and Silver Bears will be handed out to the competition winners on February 18. Since 2006, the GFF Best First Feature Award, endowed with 50,00 euros, has been presented to a promising newcomer each year. Starting this year, there is yet another new award aimed at producers and directors of documentaries, the \"Glash¨¹tte Original Documentary Award. - There are additional awards handed out to films in some particular sections, like the Teddy in the \"Panorama\" section, which goes to a gay/lesbian film. This year, the Italian costume designer Milena Canonero, who became known by her work with Stanley Kubrick, will receive the Honorary Golden Bear. The Berlinale Camera 2017 goes to Chinese film distributor Nansun Shi, Australian actor Geoffrey Rush, and Egyptian film critic Samir Farid. -\\'\\n \\'On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed US President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s introduction of-new sanctions against Iran and said other \"responsible nations\" should follow suit in view of what he called Iran\\\\\\'s recent \"defiant aggression.\" \"Iran seeks to annihilate Israel; it says so openly. It seeks to conquer the Middle East;-it threatens Europe;-it threatens the West;-it threatens the world,\" Netanyahu said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London. \"I\\\\\\'d like to talk to you on how we can ensure that Iran\\\\\\'s aggression does not go unanswered,\" he told May, apparently referring to Iran\\\\\\'s test of a ballistic missile last week. -The Trump administration said Iran was formally \"on notice\" after the test, and the president has also voiced opposition to the Iran nuclear deal with major international powers. Netanyahu is also a fierce opponent of the 2015 deal, which Britain also signed. The agreement saw Iran-pledge to curb its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. When asked whether Britain was considering new sanctions, a spokeswoman for May said \"the prime minister made clear that we support the deal on nuclear that was agreed.\" \"What happens now is that it needs to be properly enforced, and we also need to be alert to Iran\\\\\\'s pattern of destabilizing activity in the region,\" the spokeswoman said. Israel and Iran have been bitter enemies for well over-two decades. Different agendas Ahead of the talks between May and Netanyahu, Britain said it wanted Monday\\\\\\'s negotiations to focus on trade ties-as it seeks to bolster trade relations outside the European Union for when it leaves the bloc. The two leaders agreed to set up working groups to continue developing trade ties between the two countries.- May\\\\\\'s spokeswoman said the two leaders would also \"talk about a range of security and international issues, including the Middle East peace process.\" The spokeswoman said May would voice concern about how the \"continued increase of settlements activity undermines trust.\" At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister said the UK remained \"committed to a two-state solution as the best way of brokering stability and peace.\" Israel has stepped up its expansion of settlements in the Palestinian territories since the inauguration of Trump, who is perceived as sympathetic to settlement building. Palestinians say the settlements in the West bank and east Jerusalem, which are home to 600,000 Israelis, are making a two-state solution harder to achieve, a position that has wide international backing-and was also held by Trump\\\\\\'s predecessor, Barack Obama. tj/rt (AFP, AP)\\'\\n \\'Its not a bad idea paiting their faces same as that on the clip  , its very polular movie and could catch on quick .\\'\\n \\'Maria Marte migrated to Spain in 2003 and started washing dishes in a Madrid restaurant. She stayed despite the economic crisis and is now a head chef with two Michelin stars to her name. Guy Hedgecoe reports. (01.08.2015) The financial crisis that began in 2008 obliterated millions of jobs in Spain. In the wake of the meltdown, around half of those under 30 are still unable to find a job. Santiago Saez reports from Madrid and Huelva. (29.12.2016) Spanish Twitter users are accusing the Catholic Church of prioritizing its presence in the media over traditional relief work. Others say the criticism is hypocritical. (25.01.2016) \"The worst of having to queue for your food is the shame,\" says Olga, who prefers not to reveal her last name, while she takes a bite of her Spanish omelette. Olga, a tiny woman with grey hair pulled into a ponytail, has been unemployed for almost 10 years. She has a roof above her head, but the monthly 400 euros ($430) she receives from the Spanish government are not enough to make it until the end of the month. So she has had to queue up outside, waiting for the social services to give her a sandwich. \"I am always afraid a family member or friend will see me,\" she tells DW. \"I went to university you know. What if I ran into someone from my class? What would they think?\" But tonight, Olga doesn\\\\\\'t have to stand in line for food. She is sitting at a table in Madrid\\\\\\'s recently opened Robin Hood restaurant, a fairly ordinary looking Spanish bar with a cigarette machine in the corner and a ham leg on the counter. Here, Olga is served dinner by professional waiters. Every half hour she is asked whether she wants another drink or a refill on her soup. During the day the Robin Hood restaurant is a regular establishment where customers pay 11 euros for a fixed menu. But at night the place transforms into an establishment where homeless and people in need like Olga are served a sophisticated-dinner for free. The business-model is simple: the earnings made at breakfast and lunch fund the evening meals for the homeless. The Robin Hood restaurant uses its daytime earnings to fund meals for the homeless Messengers of peace The restaurant is the latest initiative launched by the charity organization Mensajeros de la Paz, which means messengers of peace, and was founded 54 years ago by priest Angel Garcia Rodriguez. In conservative Spain Father Angel, as he is often called, is a revolutionary. For example, the church he opened two years ago in Madrid\\\\\\'s trendy Chueca neighborhood is open 24/7, has a WiFi connection, and features livestreams from the Vatican and religious films. During the winter months homeless are allowed to sleep on the church benches. When DW assists a service at the San Anton Church on Sunday, it is packed with people listening to Father Angel\\\\\\'s sermon. Unlike in other churches people are walking in and out and mumbling quietly. After the service Father Angel explains why the noise doesn\\\\\\'t bother him. \"In most churches you need to be silent. We don\\\\\\'t want to tell people how they must behave. We want them to feel welcome,\" he tells DW. Finding a connection: San Anton Church offers free WiFi to homeless people Father Angel says the idea to open the Robin Hood restaurant was inspired by Pope Francis. \"He always speaks about how important is to give people dignity. It is not only about giving food to the poor, it\\\\\\'s also about how you give it to them. So seeing the long lines of people waiting outside in the cold for food, I thought: \\\\\\'why don\\\\\\'t we serve these people food in a restaurant, with proper cutlery and crystal glasses instead of plastic cups?\\\\\\'\" The-economic crisis-in Spain has had a severe impact on the country and Spanish charities like Mensajeros de la Paz are still dealing with the consequences; 30 percent of Spaniards are living close to poverty and 300,000 people in the country are homeless. Helping the homeless Currently, 100 homeless and people in need, selected by the social services of Madrid, can have dinner at Robin Hood every night. \"They have a table reserved for them, just like paying customers when they go out for dinner,\" Father Angel explains. And it is that reservation Antonio Pachon, 62, looks forward to every day. Pachon has been living on the streets of different cities in Spain since he left his native Seville in 1996. \"During the day I usually wander around the city by myself,\" he explains. \"It\\\\\\'s nice to have a place like this where a seat is waiting for me and where I can talk with people I know. As soon as I step into the door of this restaurant, I forget about my problems. And when I leave I always feel a little lighter and happier.\" Maria Vizuete has worked in several upmarket restaurants but says her job in the Robin Hood has been the most fulfilling It\\\\\\'s 8 p.m. and 42-year-old waitress Maria Vizuete is running around with plates stacked in her hand. During a break she explains that she has more then 20 years of experience working in hotels and restaurant. \"I have worked in the Ritz and other expensive hotels. But when I was asked to work here I immediately said yes. Now I am working for people who really need it and that is very gratifying,\" she tells DW. Vizuete explains that the restaurant also tends to be full during the day. \"Two weeks in advance we are usually completely booked.\" During DW\\\\\\'s visit to the restaurant the place is packed. Elena Sanchez and a friend are just finishing desert. They think the food is wonderful and are glad they can help other people by coming here. \"Since the economic crisis in 2008 so many people have gotten into deep financial trouble after losing their jobs,\" Sanchez thinks the Spanish government hasn\\\\\\'t come up with enough solutions to fight-poverty in Spain. \"There is a big need of initiatives like the Robin Hood restaurant in our country,\" she tells DW.\\'\\n \\'Facebook has been summoned to a district court in the southern city of W¨¹rzburg in what could mark a precedent in the fight against hatred and agitation in social networks. The-public hearing will take place on Monday to decide on an interim injunction against Facebook Europe - the first time the social media giant will take the stand in a German court over the spread of multiple \"fake news\" posts. While in a refugee camp in Berlin Spandau, Anas Modamani heard that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel was coming for a visit and would be talking to refugees. The 19-year-old Syrian, who is quite fond of social media, went to take a selfie. He was hoping for the selfie to inspire a real change in his life.. When Modamani\\\\\\'s house in Damascus was bombed, he fled with his parents and siblings to a smaller city called Garia. That is when Anas fled for Europe in the hope that his family could join him there, once he had made it. He first traveled to Lebanon and from there to Turkey and then on to Greece. Anas almost died on the way. In order to get to Greece from Turkey he had to travel in a rubber boat, like most refugees. Anas says the boat was overcrowded and eventually capsized and he almost drowned. From Greece Anas traveled by foot to Macedonia. He continued to Hungary and Austria. In September 2015, he reached his final destination: Munich. Once in Germany, he decided he wants to move to Berlin. He has been living there ever since. Upon arrival to Berlin, Anas spent entire days in front of the LaGeSo, a refugee center in the city. The 19-year-old says that the situation at the LaGeSo was difficult, especially during the winter. Eventually he was sent to the refugee center in Berlin Spandau. He wanted to raise awareness to his situation as a refugee and a selfie with Merkel seemed like the perfect chance to do exactly that. Anas says that the selfie with Chancellor Merkel was a life-changer for him. He got a lot of media attention after the photo was published online, and that is how his German foster family became aware of him. He has been living with them for 2 months now. They have been supporting him ever since he became a member of their family. Since living with the Meeuw\\\\\\'s Anas is happier than ever before. He is doing a German language course, has made a lot of friends and is doing a lot of cultural activities. He graduated high school in Syria and wants to pursue higher studies in Germany. But his main aim right now is to be officially granted asylum and to be able to bring his family to Germany as well. Anas is hoping for a good and safe life in Germany. But he is worried about the current sentiment towards refugees in the country. He thinks that the negative mood might escalate and have an impact on the laws in regard to refugees. Anas fears that he might not be granted asylum after all, thus ending his dream of bringing his family to Germany. Author: Rachel Baig Bavarian lawyer Chan-jo Jun filed an injunction on behalf of a young Syrian refugee who says his photo is being spread on social media with claims he is a terrorist,-or a ruthless criminal. \"Facebook is unusually difficult about implementing German law,\" Jun tells users who visit-his law office\\\\\\'s Facebook page. \"Slander and abusive insults are against German law, but not against its community standards.\" Widely shared fake news Modamani gained instant fame with a selfie he took in 2015 with the German chancellor when she visited the Berlin refugee shelter where the young newcomer was housed. He posted the picture on social media with no idea of the reception it might get, Modamani told DW in last month. German media snapped up a photo of the brief moment, and over the months, it has resurfaced on social media, too. A moment of silence a day after the suicide bombings in the Belgian capital Whenever there\\\\\\'s a refugee-related incident, he\\\\\\'s trotted out as Merkel\\\\\\'s model refugee, \"and the crimes are blamed on him,\" argues Jun. No one should have to put up with that, so now \"Modamani is fighting back,\" says the IT attorney, who has filed various legal complaints against the US social networking company, including demands that Facebook comply with Germany\\\\\\'s hate speech laws. Fighting back against slander Most recently, the photo of Modamani and false claims that he was part of a group that tried to set fire to a sleeping homeless man in a Berlin subway station in December was shared more than 500 times. It did not sufficiently violate Facebook\\\\\\'s community standards to be removed, the attorney says,-adding that his client\\\\\\'s image and the deprecatory comments can still be found on Facebook. Earlier in 2016, fake news content showed the 19-year-old refugee\\\\\\'s image in connection was the terrorist attacks in March in-Brussels, claiming he was one of them and had just pretended to be a refugee, with some sites insinuating Merkel took \"a selfie with a terrorist.\" In case of failure to comply with an order to stop circulation of the fake news about his client, Chan-jo Jun wants Facebook fined by up to 250,000 euros ($264,000.)

The store in the German city of Cologne is the first of its kind in the country and the-third one in the European Union. It sells-products of all kinds, from vegetables to beer. And the unusual thing is that all these products would otherwise have been destroyed as waste. The other peculiar thing about \"The Good Food\" is that there are no fixed prices. Consumers decide how much they think a product is worth. You only need to take one look at the figures to understand why Nicole Klaski decided to start \"The Good Food\". -Every year, one third of the food produced in the world gets wasted.- If we saved just a quarter of that wasted food, we could feed almost 900 million hungry people, according to the-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Klaski and Thurn want to stop food waste. Valentin Thurn is an author and the award-winning director of the \"Taste the Waste\" documentary. He came along to the opening to celebrate what he sees as a positive move to combat food waste. But he also told DW there were still major challenges to be overcome. \"This idea is simply great,\" Thurn said. \"I still cannot understand why we throw so much food away!\" The starting point Well, actually, he says, he does have some idea. \"The trade knows we prefer to buy something that looks perfect,\" he said. Indeed, the FAO\\\\\\'s information shows that at retail level, food is mostly wasted because it does not look attractive. Klaski told DW it was time to take action to change this. She goes into fields after they have been harvested and collects the vegetables left behind. Some of them are deemed too big, some too small, some just too ugly to sell. In her shop, the organic food then becomes accessible to everyone using a \"pay what you think\" system. Buyers can also find non-perishable products from big manufacturers which have passed their sell-by dates. A customer checks the label on a bottle from the \"past the date but delicious\" shelf. \"No one wants to throw the food away,\" Klaski said. \"We save the vegetables and expired products, and the producers are happy that their food is still eaten.\" For her, the system is a \"win-win cooperation.\"- What about health risks? Some of the curious visitors having a look around \"The Good Food\" admitted they would not buy certain products if they were past the date. Others, however, said it was easy to tell by the color or smell if a product was still in good condition or not. Klaski herself is not worried that there could be health risks involved. \"The expiry dates on products are only a suggestion for the consumer,\" she told DW. \"Most of the products last much longer.\" But in the unfortunate event that someone really did get sick, someone has to carry the responsibility. That is why Klaski says the team takes their duty very seriously to inform consumers when a product is out of date. \"And, of course, if something happens we will have to take the responsibility,\" she added. \"But we are even willing to do that; it is worth trying.\" Part of a broader movement Contrary to traditional supermarkets\\\\\\' aim of making a profit, \"The Good Food\" aims at having a social impact. \"Pay what you like\", says the sign on these products. \"Our highest expectation is to raise awareness on the problem food waste represents,\" said Anja Rickert, a member of the team at \"The Good Food\".- She believes initiatives like this can motivate people who were not previously aware of issues relating to a sustainable lifestyle. Klaski is convinced that once the first step is taken, the rest follows on. The food waste shop is part of a broader movement to reduce consumption and be aware of how we consume, she said. The furniture used, for instance, is all second hand or recycled. And most of the consumers seem to share the same philosophy. \"Coming here represents more than just buying food, it is a way of life,\" one of the clients told DW. Beyond the social movement Author and film-maker Valentin Thurn has observed a huge change in attitudes since he produced \"Taste the Waste\" in 2010: \"At that time nobody spoke about food waste, literally nobody,\" Thurn said. \"Now many people are involved, even politicians.\" However, despite strong social movements such as food-sharing, food waste remains one of the major challenges of our time. Merchandising the leftovers is not enough to combat it, Thurn is convinced.- He believes imposing economic penalties could be the only effective way to really reduce waste. \"We have to find real solutions to reduce over-production,\" he said. And this can only be done through legislation to influence-the economy and businesses models. \"It\\\\\\'s not enough to rely on action from a few big business leaders who are aware of environmental issues,\"- he concluded. - -\\'\\n \\'German Chancellor Angela Merkel was on Monday-officially nominated to run as her party\\\\\\'s candidate in this year\\\\\\'s federal elections, party sources say.-A leaders\\\\\\' meeting of her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), confirmed the foregone conclusion at a meeting in Munich. There is \"unanimous support of both parties for Merkel\\\\\\'s candidacy,\" said Horst Seehofer, the leader of the CSU and premier of Bavaria. German Chancellor Merkel has highlighted her party\\\\\\'s common ground with its Bavarian ally as the parties plot a course for the upcoming election. The meeting comes amid a surge in support for the Social Democrats. (05.02.2017) SPD candidate Martin Schulz would receive 16 percent more votes than current CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, a survey showed. The SPD has benefited since Schulz was nominated as the party\\\\\\'s candidate for the Chancellery. (02.02.2017) Martin Schulz has been nominated to run as the SPD chancellor candidate. Many people in the party are euphoric, but how will this new optimism change the Social Democrats? (31.01.2017) The 62-year-old has emerged as one of Merkel\\\\\\'s harshest critics within her own ranks in recent years, as Bavaria has borne the brunt of incoming migrants throughout the refugee crisis. Seehofer has called for a cap on the number of refugees, and in 2015-even threatened to file a complaint about the Merkel administration\\\\\\'s refugee policy with Germany\\\\\\'s highest court. In a press conference on Monday, Merkel-ruled out implementing a limit on refugee numbers, but said both the CSU and her own CDU party had agreed that the influx of more than 1 million people-in-2015-16 should not happen again. She also said the two parties would start working on a joint election platform for the upcoming vote. Agenda to be announced Merkel and Seehofer were expected to present the CDU/CSU election agenda as part of a joint statement late on Monday. A one-time research chemist from former east Germany, Merkel has been active in politics since shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After a stint as the minister for women and youth and then the environment under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, she became head of the CDU in 2000. She became chancellor herself in 2005 and has won every election contested since. Her main rival in the 2017 election will be current coalition partners the center-left Social Democrats (SPD)-and their candidate,-former European Parliament President Martin Schulz. es,nm/tj (AFP, dpa)\\'\\n \\'Born on February 6, 1917, the inimitable Zsa Zsa Gabor didn\\\\\\'t get to become a centenarian, as she died on December 18, 2016-- just a few weeks before her 100th birthday.- A-movie star for the ages, the former Miss Hungary fled her country just before World War II, joining her first husband, Turkish diplomat-Burhan Belge,-in London in June 1939.

The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here\\\\\\'s what to listen for: What\\\\\\'s the hearing about? US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump\\\\\\'s executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions. The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far. The players The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson. The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. When is this hearing? The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. It will be available for live streaming through the court\\\\\\'s website. Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case. What are the states saying? On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place. The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had \"unleashed chaos\" by signing the order. They also argue that the government\\\\\\'s claim -- that it would be \"irreparably harmed\" by keeping Robart\\\\\\'s temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits -- doesn\\\\\\'t make any sense. To accept DOJ\\\\\\'s position, they argue, \"would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ...Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\" What is the Trump administration\\\\\\'s argument? The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening. DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second-guess the President\\\\\\'s national security judgment in the immigration context. But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing -- suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court\\\\\\'s decision, then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US -- like someone traveling on a student visa. In the government\\\\\\'s view, aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US. What happens next? The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them) -- the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now. For example, the judges could dismiss DOJ\\\\\\'s request for a stay of Robart\\\\\\'s decision because, as the government acknowledges, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable, or they could uphold his ruling -- but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings. Alternatively, the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e.g., aliens living abroad) -- in which case the travel ban would go back into effect. After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court). Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court. At the moment, there are only eight justices on the court, meaning if there is a 4-4 split then the Ninth Circuit\\\\\\'s ruling will be the law of the land.\\'\\n \\'- -\\'\\n \\'DW: What\\\\\\'s new about the German-language program offered by DW? Rolf Rische: DW\\\\\\'s new German-language TV programs will include-much more cultural content than before. We interpret culture in a very broad sense: We don\\\\\\'t want to talk only about cultural highlights in literature, film and music, but also about culture\\\\\\'s social dimensions, for instance traditions and values. Our new program isn\\\\\\'t just the TV equivalent of the feature pages of a traditional newspaper;-it\\\\\\'s-much more exciting television that keeps our audience up-to-date on culture, business, sports,-science-and so much more. As always with DW, you can watch the German program anywhere in the world. For live stream access via the internet, simply click on the \"Live TV\" button in the upper left corner. You can also watch most shows per video on demand on the DW-website under the heading \"TV.\" Viewers are sure to find their favorites, from \"Europe in Concert\" and \"Kino\" to \"Kulturzeit\" and \"Shift.\" Viewers can also use the DW App under \"TV\" live to follow the German TV program on their phones. Of course, the German TV program will also continue to be broadcast in the usual manner, reaching Eastern Europe, Asia, Oceania, North and South America via satellite. Direct reception is only possible with a very large satellite dish - but DW has more than 250 broadcast partners offering the entire range of DW\\\\\\'s German TV program. \"Multichoice\" gives viewers in South Africa and nine other African countries access to the German-language program in its \"DSTv Premium\" channel. Viewers in Canada can turn to \"Shaw Cablesystems\" for DW\\\\\\'s German broadcasts. Who is your target audience? Each and every viewer interested in Germany and Europe, or in German and European points of view. And of course everyone who enjoys culture - and who wouldn\\\\\\'t? Rolf Rische is DW\\\\\\'s head of culture and society and German TV If you have a look at the schedule, you\\\\\\'ll see we\\\\\\'re truly offering a lot of culture. New, genuine cultural-content, such as the music magazine \"PopXport\" on Mondays of-each-week,-as well as a-new show called \"Kulturzeit\" that will-air-five days a week and that is acquired-from broadcasters ZDF, ORF, SRF and ARD. Sundays, watch out for the successful and-popular show \"Kultur.21.\" Then, we have a set of new shows that are all about literature: \"druckfrisch,\"-\"lesenswert\" and \"B¨¹cherjournal\" give us the opportunity to present a weekly literature broadcast. I know no other program that has such a spectrum. Another novelty is-an almost one-hour-long current affairs show entitled \"Der Tag,\" with a daily guest, and a special slot for cultural-content. Those are just three of a series-of additions that promise to make the program more exciting, as well as giving it a clear cultural-profile. Will most of that content focus on high-brow culture? No, by no means. Perhaps the line between serious \"high-brow\" culture and entertainment is more pronounced in Germany than elsewhere, but that is not true for us, the creators of the television programs. For us, there\\\\\\'s only good culture, and perhaps less good culture. Most of all, we want to get our audience interested in good movies, good music, good books, no matter whether they belong to the high culture or the pop culture category. Who would dismiss the unrivaled electronic music band Kraftwerk-as unimportant entertainment, but automatically categorize the one millionth performance of the opera \"Tosca\" on a second rate stage as high culture? People who live in ivory towers and would rather stay there, isolated, that\\\\\\'s who. We, on the other hand, are always on the lookout for quality,-beyond what I regard as totally superfluous categories. Take our award-winning film-\"Teodor Currentzis, the classical rebel,\" which tells the story of a conductor and his orchestra working on Mozart\\\\\\'s \"Don Giovanni.\" In a way, that is high culture - but most of all, it\\\\\\'s a highly entertaining movie. It\\\\\\'s a quality film, and the protagonists, Teodor Currentzis and the MusicAeterna orchestra, are really good, too. Forget the distinctions between high-brow and popular culture to focus on what\\\\\\'s good - such as Kraftwerk That said, we plan to continue to show music documentaries, but also German comedy shows like \"Ladies Night\" and \"Nuhr.\" Of course, we will also continue to broadcast the entertaining shows that have had a loyal audience for many years, including the daily \"Euromaxx - Leben und Kultur in Europa,\"-the travel show \"Check-in\" and the music show \"PopXport.\" Why are you focusing on culture at this point? Mainly because the viewers are very interested in culture, as DW\\\\\\'s market and media researchers have found out. In addition, it\\\\\\'s a perfect fit with DW\\\\\\'s chartered mission. According to the DW Act, the broadcaster is intended \"to convey the image of Germany as a cultural state in the European tradition and as a free and democratic constitutional state. They should provide a forum in Europe and on other continents for German (and other) points of view on important topics, primarily in the areas of politics, culture, and economics.\" Promoting understanding and the exchange of ideas among different cultures and peoples is Deutsche Welle\\\\\\'s mission. And that is what we hope to achieve with the new German-language program. There simply is no better approach to the values and identity of a society than via culture. By nature, the dialogue of cultures nurtures understanding. In these uneasy times, one is tempted to rephrase a well-known, decades-old German advertising slogan for a tonic based on natural herbs: \"Culture - never more valuable than today.\" -\\'\\n \\'Elizabeth ascended the throne at the age of 25, on February 6, 1952 - the day her father, King George VI, died. Already the longest-reigning British monarch since 2015, Queen Elizabeth II is now making history once again by becoming the first to celebrate a Sapphire Jubilee. The gallery above goes through some of the records detained by monarchs in the UK and around the world.- A traditional gun salute and a performance by the Band of the Royal Artillery is planned to underline the record-breaking anniversary. However, celebrations should remain limited this year. The Queen is said to want to quietly devote the day to her father\\\\\\'s memory. Larger celebrations could, however, be planned for the Queen\\\\\\'s next big anniversary, her Platinum Jubilee in 2022. As the gallery below shows, no matter how big or small the event, Her Majesty certainly knows how to dress for every occasion.-- - The Queen\\\\\\'s outfits are legendary. Her fancy hats always match with her suits and her hemlines are weighted down - to prevent windy wardrobe embarrassments. Then there\\\\\\'s the handbag: It always has the same shape. Classic, black, it\\\\\\'s just big enough to hold her lipstick, reading glasses, mint lozenges, and a handkerchief. That\\\\\\'s how the world has known her for the past 60 years. Queen Elizabeth II rarely shows up bareheaded. She has hats in all shapes and colors. Some are light and playful, trimmed with little flowers, while others look strict and sober. They always match with her outfits. Who could tell how many she actually has? It\\\\\\'s one of the world\\\\\\'s best-kept secrets. Even when she was younger, she was the queen of headgear. Here she is on the beach, donning a casual hippy style. This picture belongs to a series of historical photos of the Queen which were auctioned in 2008. A private collector can now smile with her every day. Even a princess needs to pitch in: During World War II, Elizabeth Windsor was part of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women\\\\\\'s division of the British Army. She learned mechanics and how to drive trucks. This picture was taken in 1945 - once again, with headgear. Two years after the war, Elizabeth married her childhood sweetheart, Prince Phillip of Greece and Denmark. Hundreds of ration coupons were collected to purchase her wedding gown: After the war, it was still difficult to obtain such valuable materials, even for the royal house. The satin dress was embroidered with 10,000 pearls and crystals and had a four-meter-long (13-foot) bridal train of lace. At the coronation ceremony On June 2, 1953, she wore a white silk dress with colorful embroideries representing the emblems of the Commonwealth of Nations. Attached to her shoulders, a five-meter-long (16-foot) velvet mantle was carried by six maids of honor. It was billed \"the visit of the century.\" In May 1965, the Queen was West Germany\\\\\\'s most welcome official foreign guest. 56 years had gone by since the last visit by a British state official - and two wars, during which both countries had experienced great suffering. Queen Elizabeth II spent 11 days traveling through the young Federal Republic - and charmed the Germans with her outfits. After Elizabeth II enchanted Germany with her whimsical hats, she opted for a more traditional style for her Austrian state visit in 1969. She wore a white silk dress with a red sash, and a diadem instead of a hat. In 1978, Elizabeth II came to Germany for the second time. Although she was once again received with great pomp, the procession was more modest than the one for her first visit. Over the years, normalcy and even friendship characterized the two countries\\\\\\' relations. Former German president Walter Scheel, pictured here, contributed to consolidating these ties. In February 1972, the Queen visited King Bhumibol in Thailand. She\\\\\\'d obviously have a stately gown and diadem in her suitcase, but also a few playful outfits as well (with matching hats, of course). Even though it\\\\\\'s cheerful, her summery ensemble on this picture doesn\\\\\\'t seem frivolous. Nothing can diminish her royal style - not even these 3D glasses. The Queen wore them while visiting the University of Sheffield, where she was invited to operate an excavator with a 3D display. When the Queen is not on state visits, she often prefers a modest headscarf to her designer hats. Suddenly the royal guise is concealed: She rather looks like a good-natured grandmother, pictured here in 2012. She kept it tweedy while riding with the former U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1982. The Queen showed him around the grounds of Windsor Castle, her favorite residence. On July 29, 1981, Elizabeth\\\\\\'s son Prince Charles married Lady Diana in what was considered the \"fairytale wedding of the century.\" Although the Queen apparently played a major role in the couple\\\\\\'s union, she didn\\\\\\'t manage to steal the spotlight from her daughter-in-law that day - not even in bright turquoise. When Prince William married Kate in 2011, the Queen wore a much more relaxed dress than at the wedding of Charles and Diana. Here she\\\\\\'s pictured arriving at Westminster Abbey in a sober yellow outfit. Every year for the Queen\\\\\\'s speech, she traditionally wears her official royal regalia. The speech always marks the formal beginning of a new legislative period for the British Parliament and outlines the projects of the government for the upcoming session. The Queen still dresses up in royal robes. Here she is with Prince Philip in front of Saint Paul\\\\\\'s Cathedral, during a church service in honor of the Order of the British Empire, a highly respected order of merit. The Queen turned 90 in 2016. Although she was born on April 21, 1926, her official birthday is celebrated in June, because the weather is usually nicer for outdoor ceremonies. On June 13, 2015, she drove through London with her husband Prince Philip in an all-white suit, which matched her hair perfectly.

Fire rescue officials on Sunday said three men died in a fire that broke out at a sauna club in the German capital of Berlin. Emergency services received the first call about the fire at 22:30 (2130 UTC). It is unclear how the fire erupted at the Steam Works club, located in the basement of a 10-storey building in the central Berlin district of Sch?neberg, authorities said. Other parts of the building were not affected by the blaze, they added. Firefighters had to cut through a steel gate in order to access the club, the Berlin-based \"BZ\" newspaper reported.

Nearly 30 people were at the club at the time the fire broke out. -ls/bw (dpa, BZ\\'\\n \\'Dahoud front and center of Hecking\\\\\\'s revolution Although Lars Stindl\\\\\\'s individual goal in Borussia M?nchengladbach\\\\\\'s win over Freiburg will undoubtedly be the highlight worth watching this weekend, do spare a thought for the wonderful one-two between Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud for the Foal\\\\\\'s second goal. The young attacking midfielder has reverted back to looking very much like the prodigy that first burst on the scene last season. It\\\\\\'s seems no coincidence that this has happened so soon after Dieter Hecking took over as coach. Against Freiburg, Bayer Leverkusen last week and Darmstadt the week before, Dahoud has pulled strings and dictated play at the very heart of Hecking\\\\\\'s new-look side. And as such the Foals have quickly begun moving up the league table, now back up to tenth. Lewandowski-reliant Bayern finally stumble Robert Lewandowski has a habit of making art out of football. Two weeks ago he turned a cold, wet night in Freiburg in to a stage for some game-winning magic. He\\\\\\'s done it a number of times for Bayern Munich - and this weekend\\\\\\'s-wonderful chipped finish to take the lead against Schalke was no exception. However the Polish international\\\\\\'s talent has also underlined a problem with Bayern this season;-nobody else really seems up to the task of helping him win games. Lewandowski currently has 15 league goals. The next man on the goalscoring charts is the injury-prone Arjen Robben with six and then its defender Joshua Kimmich with four, who hasn\\\\\\'t scored since October. Indeed the team hasn\\\\\\'t been playing well at all this season but for large parts of the league campaign the Polish striker has pulled them out of trouble. Unfortunately, against a stubborn Schalke side, that wasn\\\\\\'t the case. Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th goal of the season against Schalke Leipzig missing key players Although RB Leipzig\\\\\\'s strength in depth is undoubtedly one of their key assets-and a large part of their success this season, at a certain level you need your very best players for the big games. This became abundantly clear in Saturday\\\\\\'s clash with Borussia Dortmund, when a flu-ridden Timo Werner made way for-David Selke, who was tasked with leading the line. Unfortunately, the young striker fell well short of this goal and-found himself back on the bench in the second half. Indeed, Leipzig were also missing Emil Forsberg, Marcel Sabitzer and Diego Demme in a performance that seems to suggest that the key players in this team are exactly that - key to any sustained success in the Bundesliga. Dortmund struggling up front Dortmund, on the other hand, are struggling with a completely different problem: they have the key players fit and ready but such stars are still struggling to deliver the goods each week. Ousmanne Dembele\\\\\\'s dribble, run and cross for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\\\\\\'s opening goal was a thing of beauty but when the euphoria of picking up all three points against Leipzig wears off fans of the club will perhaps wonder why he can\\\\\\'t do exactly that from one game to the next. Indeed, Marco Reus\\\\\\' string of misses in the second half highlighted the simple facts. Dortmund have scored 13 fewer goals in the league this season than they had done at this point last year. Over-19 games it\\\\\\'s easy to imagine just how many more points Thomas Tuchel\\\\\\'s side would be sitting on if they could reach that-same potency in front of goal-again - maybe even all eight separating them and Leipzig in second. Ousmane Dembele (pictured jumping) set up the winner with an outstanding run and cross Consistent Frankfurt are Champions League contenders Whilst all the attention has centered around RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim and Dortmund, Niko Kovac has overseen a quiet revolution in Frankfurt.-Their 3-0 defeat in Leipzig aside (where they played with ten men for 87 minutes after Lukas Hradecky\\\\\\'s moment of madness), Eintracht have only lost one other Bundesliga game since October to find themselves third.- Statistically, the improvement can be explained by defensive solidity - by the end of the Hinrunde, the first half of-the season, Frankfurt had conceded 13 goals less than they had at the same stage last season.- But what cannot be explained in simple mathematics is the change in team spirit since Kovac took charge. Kovac is close to sporting director Fredi Bobic and together, the two have established a tangible sense of togetherness in the dressing room, with Alex Meier telling kicker magazine in November that the team are \"much more compact\" and willing to work for one another. Goal-scoring, however, remains a sticking point, with Frankfurt having found the net less than any other side in the top seven. If Kovac\\\\\\'s Frankfurt family can find a solution to that as well, there\\\\\\'s no reason they can\\\\\\'t continue to fight for a Champions League place.- When Schalke conceded a goal within the first ten minutes, it looked like their struggles were due to continue in Munich. But Naldo (center) came to the rescue, bouncing in a free kick that put Schalke level with the defending Bundesliga champions in the first half. Schalke\\\\\\'s defense took it from there, holding off Bayern to earn a valuable point away from home. Adam Szalai (left) has not done spectacularly well since leaving Mainz in 2013, but he did have a spectacular game off the bench for Hoffenheim. The Hungarian forward scored two goals against his former club to top off a fantastic rebound performance for Hoffenheim, who lost their first game of the season last week against RB Leipzig. It only took 59 seconds until Berlin took the lead against Ingolstadt on Saturday. Genki Haraguchi smashed a pass from Salamon Kalou into the back of the net, which left Martin Hansen (middle left) in a state of dismay. It was the only goal Hertha needed to secure their first win of 2017. Cologne have lost just once this season when Anthony Modeste has scored. His goal, the only goal in Cologne\\\\\\'s 1-0 win over Wolfsburg, came from the penalty spot after the French forward drew a penalty from a misguided dive from Diego Benaglio. It was his 15th goal of the season as he continues to move up the goalscoring chart. It took 73 minutes for Borussia M?nchengladbach to get their motor running, but it roared pretty loud when it kicked into gear. Gladbach scored their three goals in 15 minutes at the end of their contest with Freiburg, Raffael getting the first. Their 3-0 result was the second time this season in which Gladbach have scored three goals in the second half. Kyriakos Papadopoulos (second from left) may be a defender wearing a striker\\\\\\'s number (No. 9). But he earned his kit number after a game-winning goal against his former club Bayer Leverkusen - from which he is on loan. The goal gave Hamburg their fourth win in seven Bundesliga games. RB Leipzig shocked Borussia Dortmund in their first ever Bundesliga home game last September with a 1-0 victory. Dortmund did the shocking this time, upsetting the second-placed Red Bulls with a 1-0 victory. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed in the game\\\\\\'s only goal, his 17th of the season - in as many Bundesliga starts. Augsburg came from behind twice to secure a thrilling 3-2 victory over Werder Bremen. An entertaining and open game looked to be heading for a draw when Koo equalized with ten minutes to go. But Raul Bobadilla (pictured left) crowned a highly-impressive individual performance with the winning goal deep into stoppage time. Eintracht Frankfurt were made to work very hard for a 2-0 win over bottom-club Darmstadt in the Hesse derby. A second-half penalty by Makoto Hasebe (pictured) finally broke the deadlock before Rebic killed the game off late on. The win takes Frankfurt up to third and firmly in the race for the Champions League.

Few, except for humankind. \"Beavers are like the architects of our waterways,\"-says of Iris Barthel of German conservation group Nabu. \"They build dams, burrow, gnaw and fell trees and shrubs. In this way, beavers have shaped our riverscapes for millions of years.\" But despite - and sometimes because of - a shared propensity for reshaping the landscape, humans and beavers don\"t always make good neighbors. By the early 20th century, humans had hunted the Eurasian beaver - prized for its meat and warm, dense pelt --almost to extinction. In Germany, a few animals survived in pockets on the Elbe river. More recently, protection of the species and reintroduction programs have seen beaver numbers bounce back. Today there are around 30,000 in Germany, with strongholds in east Germany, as well as parts of Bavaria, on the Upper Rhine and the southwest of North-Rhine Westphalia. After a long absence, the hefty rodents-- with their unmistakable flat tails and blunt snouts . became, if not a common sight, at least something you might be lucky enough to glimpse on a German riverbank. Still, beavers are shy, and anyone looking for signs of their presence along the Rhine or Elbe might do better to look out for a beaver\\\\\\'s dam, or the stumps of trees felled by gnawing. Beaver dams are hard to miss Beaver-made flooding Some riverside residents, however,-don\\\\\\'t have to go out looking for traces of beaver activity. Just as manmade dams can be disaster for the habitat of other animals, so some Germans have found their own homes flooded by beaver-made reservoirs. One homeowner who found the foundations of his house in German city of J¨¹lich threatened by rising water levels from a beaver dam told local broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk: \"They don\"t belong here in the middle of the city. We\\\\\\'r not an open-air zoo.\" Nabu says conflict usually occurs when farms or gardens extend right up to the river bank-or where the natural floodplain is altered. \"The beavers aren\"t aware of property ownership. They see the riverbank as a place they can dig their burrow,\"-says Barthel. \"They see tasty food in fields or orchards. So it can happen that a tractor breaks a beaver lodge or a beaver fells a favorite apple tree.\" She adds that beavers have been accused of burrowing into dams and dikes, disrupting manmade flood defences, but says there are well-practiced defenses against this kind of damage. \"If beavers are pilloried by politicians, it\\\\\\'s primarily to distract from their own failures in flood prevention,\"-says Barthel. Beavers are landscape architects - something humans hold against them Warming beaver-human relations Biologist Jessica Dieckmann told DW that part of her role as newly-appointed commissioner on beavers for the German city of Hamm was to help deal with conflicts arising between homeowners and their beaver neighbors. She explained that because injuring or killing beavers or damaging their dams and burrows is forbidden in German, \"A solution has to be found tactfully.\"?\"A solution could be that landowners sell a 20-meter-wide (66-foot-wide) riparian strip and make it available for nature protection,\"-says Dieckmann. Her other tasks as beaver commissioner include finding out whereabouts beavers are in Hamm and how many there are, to know how best to deal with the creatures in the future. Beavers usually live in burrows in the river bank accessed by an underwater tunnel. The dam ensures the water is deep enough to hide the entrance to their \"lodge\"-beneath the surface. But while human construction often runs at complete odds with the needs of other living species, beaver dams bring benefits to a whole host of other species. \"They create small ponds, deadwood, marsh areas-or open up areas of soil,\"-says Barthel. These provide habitats for dragonflies, amphibians and reptiles, for fish and birds. \"Where humans have to spend a lot of money on preserving biodiversity, the beaver helps out for free.\" \"At the same time, it contributes to the cleanliness of water, re-natures rivers and supports natural flood prevention.\"\\'\\n \\'The American Marin Alsop, the Mexican Alondra de la Parra, the Lithuanian Mirga Gra?inyt?-Tyla and the Estonian Anu Tali have been stirring up excitement in the world of classical music in the past few years. But one of the first to crack the glass ceiling in this male-dominated profession is the Australian Simone Young. She\\\\\\'s been professionally active in Germany for over 30 years, including 10 years as General Music Director and Opera Director in Hamburg. For the past year and a half, she\\\\\\'s been a freelance conductor, and is in demand worldwide.- Deutsche Welle: DW is soon to start a German-language television program with cultural and arts content. What do you think of that? Simone Young: I\\\\\\'m surprised it doesn\\\\\\'t already exist. If I find myself in a train in England or America for example, and people are speaking German nearby, I can never resist the temptation to get involved in the conversation. Invariably, the internationally mobile Germans have a keen interest in culture. As a director of an opera house, you may have noticed, like I, that foreign critics are much kinder to new productions than German critics are. What does that say about Germans and their attitude towards the arts? It has a lot to do with the fact the arts take a very central position in life in Germany, in a way that they don\\\\\\'t, for example, in the English speaking world. Here productions are expected to have a political commentary on current situations, or otherwise be socially relevant. A German critic comes to the performance with the expectation of being challenged, and of finding program notes revealing-what was on the mind of the director. I applaud the idea that the arts should say something about humanity\\\\\\'s current situation, that they remain alive and current and relevant, but dislike the kind of intellectual snobbishness that goes with some of this. Extrapolating on this, and drawing on your experience of working in-German speaking lands, what would you say is the essence of being German? I think it\\\\\\'s changing, but something I have always found fascinating about the Germans is that they are very politically conversant. I remember that in Australia, where I was born, you didn\\\\\\'t talk about religion or politics in polite company! But when I first came to Germany, I was delighted and at the same time shocked by how readily my contemporaries would get into heavy conversations about politics - or about religion for that matter. I eventually realized that the idea of giving voice to your opinion is something that is very actively developed in Germany. Now, not every opinion is worth listening to. And there still is a sense here that everyone says their piece, and the one who says it loudest gets listened to. But I applaud a society that is as politically aware and as self-critical as this one. - This production of Borodin\\\\\\'s \"Prince Igor\" from 2012 falls within Young\\\\\\'s tenure as director of the Hamburg State opera What are the kinds of messages and values that you think should be projected from Germany to the rest of the world? Or is there even a need for that? I think there is more and more a need for that. Let\\\\\\'s put it bluntly: both with Brexit in the UK and Trump in America, I think we\\\\\\'re moving into a time when countries are becoming very focused on their own needs and desires in a very selfishly inward-looking way, like: we\\\\\\'ll deal with the rest of the world later. Germany carries with it, of course, the legacy and the guilt of the 20th century, and as such continues to engage with the world outside in a way that acknowledges the debts that contemporary Germany has to the rest of the world. Of course, I move in liberal circles, in that in the operatic, the symphonic, the arts world in general, you\\\\\\'re dealing with a generally high level of education and social awareness. So I am in a little bit of a bubble. - Maybe everybody\\\\\\'s in a bubble in this increasingly polarized world. But with your intense connection to this country, do you see yourself in one way or another as a spokesperson or a representative for the German brand or German values? Actually, there are a number of very fine international Australian artists who really now have a sort of double heritage. While never denying our Australianness, our musical beings have been very much developed and enriched by our experiences in Germany. I\\\\\\'m quite honored to be lumped in with and described as a German conductor, for example, when I go to the States. I\\\\\\'m an Australian conductor, but I have very much a German style, and after all the years here, have a real affinity with the repertoire in Germany. So getting lumped in with German conductors is something I quite like, as it describes the kind of conductors whose work I admire too. At the New Year\\\\\\'s Eve concert in Hamburg, 2014 How is work-life in your field in Germany different from that in other countries? The tradition in Germany is highly professional. Everybody is good at what they\\\\\\'re hired to do, but they carry no responsibility for the job of anybody else. I always say: when you come to Germany as an English speaker, the first sentence you learn is: \"Es geht nicht\" (That-cannot be done).-And the next one you get is: \"Es war ja immer so \"? (This is how we\\\\\\'ve always done it\"? And the third one is: \"\"Ich bin aber nicht daf¨¹r zust?ndig.\"\" (I\\\\\\'m not responsible for that).

The black-and-white feline is thought to have lost his hind legs in a mishap involving either a car or train in April last year. Pooh-and another cat, Stiven, were taken to Sofia\\\\\\'s Central Vet Clinic by the animal charity-Let\\\\\\'s Adopt Bulgaria. Veterinary surgeon Vladislav Zlatinov is the first vet in Europe to have success in applying the pioneering method of Irish neuro-orthopaedic surgeon Noel Fitzpatrick, who carried out a similar operation in Britain. Zlatinov scanned relevant papers in scientific journals to prepare for the procedure, but without any commercial implants available, he had to have some parts custom-built. The titanium stem joins the bone and can be attached to swappable prosthetic limbs When the complex surgery was completed, Pooh had a pair of titanium legs implanted into his body. These can then be connected to external prostheses which can be changed like shoes. Pooh, whose name means \"fluff\" in Bulgarian, can move pretty well considering the circumstances,-chasing toy mice and fully exploring his new environment. He can even jump up for toys. \"We\\\\\\'re very proud,\" said Zlatinov. \"It was quite a success ... It gives hope to other patients.\" \"Cats who lost one leg do pretty well. But what happens if they lose both their hind legs? Yes, they move somehow, but what quality of life are we talking about?\" he said. Better than a life on wheels Until Pooh\\\\\\'s skin grows over the bone and stem enough to be sure there is no infection, veterinary staff are still supervising his recovery closely. Other than that, the only thing that\\\\\\'s different to before is a tiny tapping sound whenever his polymer and rubber paws hit the floor. It\\\\\\'s the sort of independence that the normal solution - a set of wheels - would never have offered. Staff at the clinic are looking for a new home for Pooh, and there have already been several applicants. Since Pooh\\\\\\'s operation, Zlatinov has carried out the procedure on a number of other cats including Stiven, who was also said to be doing well. (AP, AFP, Reuters)\\'\\n \\'Would you avoid shopping online if you thought that would help the environment? That\\\\\\'s what Germany\\\\\\'s environment minister Barbara Hendricks does. She recently told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that she refuses to buy anything over the internet because it results in too much packaging waste. But is buying online really more damaging for the environment than heading into a bricks-and-mortar shop? Packaging overkill? Hendricks told the newspaper: \"Ordering goods over the internet is a big problem regarding rubbish. Also, in some cities nowadays, more and more food is delivered by ordering online. There are also increasing numbers of single-person households. That means that more ready meals and smaller portions are being bought. That leads to a lot of packaging waste.\" Shopping online in many countries around the globe is growing fast---in the US, market analysts have predicted that between 2013 and 2018, online grocery sales alone will grow annually at an average of 21.1 per cent, according to Packaging World Magazine. Offline grocery sales are expected to rise by a mere 3.1 per cent on average annually during the same period. Packaging - customers want just enough for their product to arrive intact But while consumers may complain about their online-ordered products-arriving wrapped in excessive packaging, they don\"t want their goods to reach them damaged, either. Some businesses are trying to minimize the environmental footprint by using recyclable materials in their packaging. For instance, Ecovative\\\\\\'s mushroom-based packaging made from mycelium --the root-like structure of mushrooms --is biodegradable. Others, including Amazon, have started using new box-making technology that enables them to customize packaging based on the exact size of the product being shipped, helping reduce overpackaging. Professor Gerrit Heinemann, head of the eWeb Research Center at the Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences, told DW that while studies show that both online and offline shopping are similar in how eco-friendly they are, they showed that buying over the internet has the edge. He explained: \"With online shopping, the packaging is more environmentally-friendly than the plastic bags you have in shops.\"  More people are switching from shopping high streets to buying online The carbon footprint Transport also has to be factored in when trying to weigh up online and offline shopping\\\\\\'s green credentials. The carbon footprint generated while shopping can depend a lot on where someone lives, what method of transport is used and how close the nearest store is. A-shopper in the bike-friendly Netherlands heading to a nearby store will likely yield lower carbon emissions per person than a motorist-travelling half-an-hour to a store in the US-Midwest, where people rely more on their cars. Also, whether you go shopping alone or with others, or buy one item or several can also affect the carbon footprint. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013 found that the further away someone lived from a store and the less efficient the method of transport, then the more eco-friendly it would be to buy online. The paper found that offline shoppers have a carbon footprint almost twice that of online shoppers who never go inside a physical store. Traditional shoppers may make several trips to the store to find out more about the product, compare prices, and finally buy the product, whereas online shoppers can do all of this without leaving the comfort of their homes. But carbon can be added onto online purchases in other ways - for instance, picking up items after a failed delivery or from a click-and-collect point, or returning unwanted items. \"Showrooming\"-- trying out products in person at a bricks-and-mortar store before buying online --stands out as being a particularly environmentally-unfriendly way of shopping. Opting for fast delivery also poses environmental problems: same-day delivery and tight delivery slots make-it more difficult for the delivery firms to combine shipments to the same neighborhood. That means a larger distance driven per item. Shopping in a physical store can mean more eco-unfriendly packaging with plastic bags What can consumers and companies do? Both online and offline shopping can be done in eco-friendlier ways. For buying on the internet, consumers should avoid next-day or same-day delivery, and where an eco-friendly packaging option exists, plump for it wherever possible. If consumers need to visit a physical store, then coordinating shopping trips with other errands, buying in bulk rather just a few items and doing the trip with others will help. Cycling or walking to the nearest store is of course going to be better for the environment than driving to a shop just for a carton of milk --and if a car is used, then buying a lot of stuff at one time will be better than buying single items from an e-retailer. For their part, bricks-and-mortar stores could provide more information online so that customers make better-informed purchase decisions, and could also encourage customers to pick up their online orders at stores located in dense urban areas.  Online and offline shopping are similar on eco-friendliness - but online \\\\\\'has the edge\\\\\\' Professor Heinemann told DW that improving efficiency on the so-called \"last mile\" --the point of delivery to the household --could boost online shopping\\\\\\'s green credentials. \"The question is, why do we have so many delivery services, such as DHL, UPS etc, which all deliver small amounts, rather than bundling them?\"-he said. \"Amazon is already preparing hubs - they have just announced they will build their own airport, so they will take over their own deliveries and will be able to bundle them.-In California, there are already a-lot of pick-up stations-where you can pick up food. In universities you can pick up books-from Amazon.\" Professor Heinemann also recommended that customers change their buying behavior. \"The biggest part of retail is food, and the average purchase-in Germany-is-only-11 euro,\"-he told DW, saying that if people bought double as much each time they went shopping, \"it would mean 50 per cent less drives to the store and-that-would-have the biggest impact on the environment.\" But ultimately, rather than impulse-buying, thinking-about whether you really need the product at all could prove the most environmentally-friendly step-of all.\\'\\n \\'nnnndddd thats how you get drone striked....\\'\\n \\'Shortly after Trump\\\\\\'s inaugural declaration that from now on, it would be only \"America First,\" a Dutch comedy show called-\"Zondag Met Lubach\" parodied the new US president\\\\\\'s rhetoric, absurdly promoting all the reasons why the Netherlands should come in second.

Half a million citizens took to the streets on Sunday in the largest of a series of demonstrations over a bill that would have protected many politicians from being prosecuted for corruption. The Social Democrat-led government announced that day in a statement that it was repealing the decree, which had been approved last week without input from Parliament. However, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu indicated that he still planned to push through the amendments to the criminal codes via legislation that would be put to Parliament for approval. Protests continued over the issue Monday night -- albeit on a smaller scale -- with calls for the government to be removed. \\\\\\'Transparent government\\\\\\' In his speech on Tuesday, Iohannis, a former National Liberal Party politician, said withdrawing the decree is too little. Although he stopped short of calling for a fresh election, he told members of the center-left government, which has been in power since December, \"Your first worry was to take care of the files of the convicted (politicians). Romanians are appalled. \"The withdrawal of Ordnance 13 is too little. Early elections, at this point, is too much. Who needs to come up with a solution? The Social Democrats, as they created the problem.\" At this point, members of the governing coalition -- made up of the Social Democrats and a smaller party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, walked out of the room. \"Are you already tired?\" asked the President. \"Too bad. Romania needs a strong government, a transparent one, whose governing is predictable, done in broad daylight, not stealthily at night.\" He went on to ask, \"What kind of nation do we want to be? Do we want to be a strong, prosperous one, which builds a rule of law and respects it, where justice is strong and independent? Or do we want to be a weak nation, despised, which risks everything to save a few from difficult times?\" This, he said, would be the \"question and the purpose\" of a referendum, which would \"really find out the will of the Romanian people.\" Demonstrations continue Around 25,000 demonstrators gathered in Victory Square, Bucharest, on Monday evening and around 20,000 elsewhere in the country, according to estimates by the Romanian media. Although they turned out in far smaller numbers than Sunday, they continued to call for the government to resign. A counter-demonstration with about 3,000 people gathered outside the presidential palace in support of the government, calling for Iohannis to resign. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Vlad Mixich, a Romanian journalist and political commentator, said of the President\\\\\\'s address to Parliament, \"He talked mainly to the people who protested in the last week in the streets. I think it was important for him to do that. \"This was one of the biggest protests in Romania since (the fall of communism in) 1989. So he had to speak directly to those people who were in the streets to protest even if the protesters don\\\\\\'t perceive the President as their leader\".\" Mixich said the referendum suggested by the President \"would be a symbolic gesture. One of the type that politicians love so much -- it will keep this topic on the table.\" A brighter future \"The protests won\\\\\\'t stop until some of the ministers will quit their jobs. We\\\\\\'ve had enough of them,\" said Bianca Dumitru, 25, a sports journalist who joined protests in her home town of Brasov, central Romania. \"The last week was incredible for the whole country. We got so united and motivated that we have to thank the government for this. But I think it\\\\\\'s time for them to let us enjoy the victory and live in a prosperous environment, with a bright future ahead.\" Parliament is due on Wednesday to debate a censure motion submitted by the opposition in a bid to remove the government from office. This is not expected to succeed, as the coalition holds a majority in the legislative body.\\'\\n \\'In the beginning, I have to admit, my approach to the subject was naive. \"Clearly, palm oil is something I\\\\\\'ve heard of before,\" I said, \"it\\\\\\'s a product of the oil palm tree. Perhaps it is similar to coconut fat, maybe olive oil, it\\\\\\'s most likely used for cooking.\" And I assumed that I would learn a lot about this fat relatively quickly. Boy, I was wrong. Avoiding it would be quite a challenge. And that was exactly my task. A few days later I had read a few articles, scanned websites of environmental organizations, and watched YouTube videos on the subject and was quite surprised by what I had found. What had I gotten into? The stuff was everywhere. In food. Not only in Nutella, but also in pretzels, soup, chocolate, biscuits, muesli or margarine. Cosmetics were also full of it. And because palm oil is often used in animal feed, every sausage I would buy was probably, at least indirectly, a palm oil product. And what about gasoline? I had assumed that it contained mainly rape oil, but no: most of it is palm oil. \"I need someone to help me understand this oily business,\" I thought. To make things even more complicated, I found out that there\\\\\\'s something called \"green palm oil,\" a certified, perhaps sustainable variant of palm oil. Would that be the solution? Could I use that without remorse? Obviously not, several sources stated. For \"green\" is often nothing more than a smoke screen to cover up environmental destruction. Because for palm oil, rainforest is cut down on a huge scale to make way for monocultures, which can meet the huge demand worldwide. Huge, of course, because palm oil is in everything. Monday I started to turn my kitchen and bathroom upside down. I wanted to understand how bad my behavior really was. But it\\\\\\'s actually impossible to study the list of ingredients of each and every product I have at home. What I understood was that companies rarely use the term \"palm oil.\" Instead, they use technical terms or complicated names for something that could be anything. But palm oil? In the best case it said that some \"vegetable fats\" were included. Then, however, I struck lucky. While reading about palm oil, I came across an app that might help, I hoped: Codecheck. If you use this app to scan the barcodes of products, it spits out all sorts of information on ingredients, including palm oil. Tuesday The core of the Codecheck app is a database, which is continually updated by the app\\\\\\'s users, but also with data coming from environmental groups, Franziska Grammes of Codecheck explained to me. In addition, I learned how the rating system works, which allows the user to see if a particular product is good for them or not: To my surprise, I found almost no food product in my household containing palm oil. However, it was quite common in our cosmetics. Codecheck also distinguishes between good and bad palm oil. Good means \"certified.\" This certification is the main contentious issue in the discussion about palm oil. There are different ways to assess palm oil, all of which want to prove that the oil is produced sustainably. However, there is probably no perfect way to prove sustainability, because too many parameters have an impact on production: Is the palm oil produced in a monoculture, or does the rain forest remain untouched? Which fertilizers are used to which extent? Are pesticides used? Do different production standards apply to different markets? And what are farmers getting out of it? Can they make a living growing this crop? The best known and most controversial approach is certification according to the RSPO, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which was launched by the conservation group WWF. Most of the main players in the market, including supermarket chains, use this certification process. Palm oil, which has been certified according to the RSPO, is supposed to fulfill certain conditions, says the WWF. Wednesday Critics, however, see the requirements as too lax. The system isn\\\\\\'t perfect yet, the WWF\\\\\\'s Ilka Peterson admits during our conversation. But as the organisation\\\\\\'s palm oil expert, she says the certification standard is an important step to build upon. The demand for palm oil has doubled over the past ten years. One in two products in an average German supermarket contain the oil. And Germany and Europe are not even the main markets. India and Indonesia consume the most palm oil per year, 10.4 and 9.1 million tons respectively. The EU as a whole uses less than 6.5 million tons. \"But wouldn\\\\\\'t it be possible to replace palm oil in Europe with another, native oil?\", I asked. It is not that easy, Ilka Peterson said. \"We just do not have enough space here.\" Thursday This is a statement that Sven Selbert simply can\\\\\\'t subscribe to. The expert for tropical forests works for the conservation group Robin Wood. He has a clear idea of how a switch to rape could work. The crux is the massive use of fertilizers in the cultivation of oil palm trees, he says. Without them, the high yield of four tons per hectare wouldn\\\\\\'t be possible and the yield shrinks to the level of rape. This in turn would make the switch to rape potentially viable. In addition, land has to be freed up. And this could be done if we finally stopped burning precious oil for fuel. For me, there is no issue when it comes to palm oil in gasoline. The simple reason is: I barely drive. I can simply choose not to consume palm oil as gasoline. But many others do. And driving is responsible for a large, if not the largest chunk of palm oil consumption in Europe. With that in mind, it seems impossible to produce all the oil we need- in a way that can be certified as sustainable. Another problem is the existence of different standards, says Robin Wood. Standards applied in Europe, for example, don\\\\\\'t automatically apply in other regions of the world. Instead, the producers make palm oil for the European market sustainably, but not for markets in the rest of the world. And the rest of the world consumes substantially more palm oil than Europe. For my project, Robin Wood is the counterpart to the WWF. In the end, both organizations are pulling together for the greater good, to make palm oil more environmentally friendly. Even if one organisation criticizes the other, both say that it is up to us consumers to become active now. If we actively demand alternatives, if we start buying palm oil-free products, and if we make it clear to producers that we take nature conservation seriously, then something can change. Friday Next for my experiment, Martina Bacher finally gets on board. She runs the website Umweltblick.de and has put together a shopping guide which gives consumers the power to fight the mainstream by showing them alternatives to palm oil. Starting in late 2014, food that contains palm oil needs to say so in Germany, says Martina Bacher. Cosmetics and cleaning products still don\\\\\\'t need to be labelled. This is one reason why she developed her list and keeps it up-to-date. It is supposed to be a kind of map through the jungle of ingredients. Our conversation brings my week-long experiment to a close. I have not lived completely without palm oil, but I have realized what I am doing, what kinds of products I buy and what I have to look out for. I have learned that it is sometimes hard to recognize palm oil. I have learned that there are certainly efforts to give the sought-after oil a push towards a more sustainable future. Of course, this road is long, and which way we are headed probably depends too much on the profits that palm oil promises companies today. But I also learned that I\\\\\\'m doing pretty well right now, when it comes to palm oil. I rarely use cars, I cook my food at home almost every day and know exactly what kind of ingredients I used (certainly not palm oil). When it comes to cosmetics I always avoid stuff from ordinary drugstores and I eat very little meat. But do I live a life without palm oil? No, I don\\\\\\'t. But perhaps life does not need to be entirely palm oil-free. We, as consumers, must be aware of the impact our consumption has on nature. We must adjust accordingly. And if we want less monoculture and less virgin forest to be cleared for palm oil plantations, then we should just make sure that we don\\\\\\'t buy products that contain palm oil. And in doing so, the information and impulses that my conversation partners have given can provide some very useful assistance.\\'\\n \"Recent images from the European Space Agency\\'s Mars Express satellite offer a new perspective to the ice cap on the planet\\'s north pole. Using 32 separate shots collected over a six-year period, the images show dark, spiraling troughs cutting up a million square kilometers of ice-covered terrain. The ice cap and its swirling appearance is believed to have formed when strong winds from the planet\\'s elevated center blew towards the pole and circled in a similar fashion to hurricane spirals on Earth.- Although the ice cap is permanent throughout the year, the winter months can mean up to 30 percent of the planet\\'s atmospheric carbon dioxide precipitates and adds an additional meter of ice to the pole. This adds to the predominantly frozen water and dust on the planet\\'s surface.- When the ice falls on the terrain, it highlights the numerous canyons in the region, including the Chasma Boreale. The chasm-cuts across the pole as a 500km-long and 3km-deep feature seen clearly from space.\"\\n \\'Television journalist and director Nicola Graef accompanied the world-renowned painter Neo Rauch for three years with her film camera and microphone-to make the film \"Neo Rauch - Gef?hrten und Begleiter\"-(loosely translated as \"Neo Rauch - Comrade and Companion\").- What she discovered was an extremely modest person who goes to his studio every day at the same time, just like a laborer punching the clock. \"Nothing whizzes past him,\" Graef said in an interview with DW. \"You notice that in the way he works. He is a very concentrated person who completely focuses on things.\" It doesn\\\\\\'t bother him when someone watches him work. He has none of the airs some artists have, none of the vanities. Only when he can\\\\\\'t move a heavy canvas will Rauch show his irritation on camera, but it\\\\\\'s short-lived. There\\\\\\'s an-admirable-calm about him - and does not allow himself to be deterred, loyal to-his typical style of socialist realism of the Leipzig School. A foreign world His large-scale canvases are inhabited by enigmatic characters, eerie scenes and dark fantasy-like figures. He paints what\\\\\\'s in his head, further develops his idiosyncratic style, goes through phases of employing different colors, stoically and unwaveringly. Rauch\\\\\\'s images are enigmatic and unusual Collectors from around the world vie with each other to buy his paintings, and his exhibitions are usually sold-out events. That disconcerts Rauch, and that\\\\\\'s also what makes him so unbelievably likeable, said Graef. The whole picture Neo Rauch as a person takes center stage in Graef\\\\\\'s documentary: as a painter, an artist colleague, a father, the husband of successful painter Rosa Loy, as a friend of Harry Lybke, the gallery owner who represents him, and as a friendly conversation partner to collectors and other art lovers. The film takes us on an amazing journey of discovery: What characterizes this unique global phenomenon that is Neo Rauch? What are the artistic roots of his unconventional painting? Why is he so calm and collected, despite his international fame? For the first time in years, Rauch speaks in front of the camera about these topics, but also about the wounds and emotional chasms that have preoccupied him all his life. Filling the void Neo Rauch was born on April 18, 1960 in Leipzig. He grew up with his grandparents, after losing his parents in a tragic train accident when he was just four weeks old. \"He has felt that void his entire life,\" Graef noted. \"Since he is such an extremely sensitive person, all of that emotion is laid bare. And you can see that in his pictures.\" The artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in his hometown of Leipzig, and the school became his artistic homeland. As of 1986, he was a master student under and later assistant to Arno Rink. Those experiences had a profound effect on the young student. Rauch with his wife Rosa Loy, also a painter, in front of his work \"Kalimuna\" His apocalyptically inhabited works made a fast splash in the art world and, early on in his career, were shown at major museums in Basel, Maastricht, Munich and New York. He became famous quickly, his pictures taking their place in private and public collections. From 2005 to 2009, he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig. That was an important part of his life that meant a lot to him, noted Graef.- His own cosmos As a painter, Rauch maintains the down-to-earth manner typical of eastern Germany and stays loyal to his style, his friends and his hometown - and to gallery owner, Harry Lybke, who has represented him all these years. All of them accept him the way he wants to be. \"He is someone who permeates everything. That\\\\\\'s why he\\\\\\'s in his own cosmos - in himself, in his painting, in his studio,\" said director Graef, reflecting on filming with the artist. \"That\\\\\\'s why you sometimes get the feeling that he\\\\\\'s not of this world. But maybe that\\\\\\'s also why his pictures are so powerful.\" Her documentary gives viewers a glimpse into the world of thought behind Neo Rauch\\\\\\'s pictures. It\\\\\\'s a strong film, its images shot with sensitivity and arranged in an entertaining manner. It hits movie theaters on March 2, 2017. The gallery below revisits some of the most important artists of the Leipzig-School. Neo Rauch, 55, is regarded as one of the most important contemporary German painters. His large-format works and graphics have a surreal feel, a trademark of the Leipzig-born artist\\\\\\'s style. Rauch\\\\\\'s paintings conquered the art market in the 1990s. Gerd Harry Lybke (pictured here with Rauch), the Leipzig art dealer who signed Rauch and other artists after reunification, was an important mediator for the new movement. Lybke has a colorful history: his gallery was under observation by the East German secret Police: the much feared Stasi. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Leipzig became a center for contemporary art once again. Neo Rauch was actually the movement\\\\\\'s only native East German, while Tim Eitel, Rosa Loy and David Schnell (pictured) were West German. The name stuck, however, and New Leipzig School works became immensely popular. Tim Eitel\\\\\\'s figurative paintings hang in many private collections around the world. His connection with the New Leipzig School helped him to fame. Often based on newspaper clippings or photographs, his works comment on our society. Arno Rink,75, studied at the Leipzig Academy for Visual Arts, and he also taught at the academy in the early 1970s. His early works are influenced by Picasso, Dix and Beckmann, and many echo mythical themes. Rink is the link between East Germany\\\\\\'s Leipzig School and today\\\\\\'s New Leipzig School. In terms of a specific genre, the Leipzig School didn\\\\\\'t really exist. The name evolved when several painters from Leipzig - Bernhard Heisig (pictured), Wolfgang Mattheuer and Werner T¨¹bke - were invited to the documenta 6 exhibition in 1977. These artists had increasingly moved away from State-sanctioned art and socialist realism from the 1960s. The trio was labeled the \"artistic miracle\" of the East. Werner T¨¹bke - regarded as a Traditionalist and a critical realist - was famous in East Germany for numerous large scale wall paintings. His works disappeared after reunification. Wolfgang Mattheuer used strong images from ancient mythology in his works, that often focused on the fears and desires harbored by his fellow East Germans. Like the other Leipzig painters, Mattheuer wouldn\\\\\\'t be silenced by East German authorities. The artists also didn\\\\\\'t want to belong to a \"School,\" and refused the label Leipzig School.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the best-known German-language actors to conquer Hollywood.

How are you going to jump that shadow? What do you bring to the table? Matthias Maurer: Well, you said it: Alexander Gerst is very well known in Germany - he\\\\\\'s famous here. That\\\\\\'s because he did an outstanding job. He flew the 2014 Blue Dot mission. And next year he flies again and then it\\\\\\'ll be as commander of the International Space Station (ISS). So I believe he did an outstanding job, and I want to follow his example. But I also want to try to find my own profile. And what would that profile be? Would it be in the science you do? Yes, I\\\\\\'m very much into science. But today is my first day as an astronaut. So I will begin with [my training] and the sharper profile will come later. But tell us a bit about your scientific background. What is your area of speciality? I studied material science engineering in Germany. I also studied in the UK, in Leeds, and in France and Spain. So I\\\\\\'m a material scientist with a European training as my background. Material science focuses on the development of new materials, which are the basis of innovation and economic progress.  Thumbs up for Europe\\\\\\'s new space trio: German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries, Maurer, and ESA head Jan W?rner  The European Space Agency has named German scientist Matthias Maurer as one of its new astronauts. But who is the young spaceman? On Thursday, Maurer introduces himself at ESA\\\\\\'s Space Operations Center. (01.02.2017) The Spanish satellite was developed by Germans and launched on a Russian rocket from French Guiana. It carried the first implementation of a new satellite platform that Germany hopes to further roll out in coming years. (28.01.2017) Believed to have been created by the planet\\\\\\'s huge mountains and quick winds, the 10,000-kilometer-long gravity wave would be far larger than anything similar recorded in our Solar System so far. (17.01.2017) In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Director General of the European Space Agency, Jan W?rner, outlined the agency\\\\\\'s plans for Mars, the moon and dealing with satellites in deeps space. (18.01.2017) After 17 years and numerous setbacks and budget boosts, Europe\\\\\\'s Galileo satellite navigation system has gone live. At this point, 18 of the planned 30 satellites are already in orbit. (15.12.2016) So you do some science up at the ISS, you bring it back down to Earth, and what should we imagine we might end up having in our pockets at the end of it? Make it real for people. Well the best example I can give you about a space innovation is this: Perhaps you have a mobile phone with a fruit on it [Ed.: We think he means an Apple iPhone]\"?and perhaps the casing is made of glass metal. That\\\\\\'s a technical term. And metal glasses were actually developed in space, on the Space Shuttle, in the 1980s. NASA patented the procedure and the production method, and only now - 20 or 30 years later - this invention is in our pockets, as you said. Let\\\\\\'s look into the future now, because you\\\\\\'ve spoken a bit about the moon and the plans for a Moon Village. What is about the moon that fascinates you? The moon is fascinating because it\\\\\\'s there. Everyone knows it and sees it, and we can learn so much on the moon. We can use the moon as a base for astronomy. The moon\\\\\\'s atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths that we cannot see on Earth, so that\\\\\\'s really important. But we can also learn about the moon itself. The moon is a dead body, so we can learn about the history of Earth and how our solar system evolved. These are data that scientists need to accurately predict where in the universe we can find live. But while you say you wouldn\\\\\\'t take a one-way ticket to Mars, would you spend an extended period of time on the moon? Definitely, definitely. Now when we travel to the ISS we spend six months there, or even 12 months, and I believe a similar amount of time on the moon is absolutely feasible. So when do you think is the next most realistic opportunity for you to be in space? With Gerst\\\\\\'s mission as ISS Commander in 2018, you probably won\\\\\\'t make that because all the seats have been reserved. So when is a realistic time? Currently we have Thomas Pesquet in space. Later in the year we will have another European astronaut, Paolo Nespoli flying, in 2018 Alexander Gerst, and in 2019 it\\\\\\'s Luca Parmitano. On average we have one flight per year. So the next free flight is 2020. But there are other astronauts who are looking to take that seat - not only me. When you say \"one flight per year\"?you mean for European astronauts\"? Yes. It\\\\\\'s one flight per year on average for European astronauts to the ISS. But there are also new opportunities, like the Chinese space station which will be ready by 2022. We are working towards a cooperation with the Chinese, although that still needs to be established. That\\\\\\'s an exciting development, isn\\\\\\'t it? It is absolutely exciting. And I think it\\\\\\'s an excellent way to show how spaceflight actually brings people and the world together. It\\\\\\'s also a very good thing in politically uncertain times to have spaceflight cooperation because that unites people and always builds a base.- Matthias Maurer-is the newest recruit to the European Space Agency\\\\\\'s astronaut corps. He has a doctorate (PhD) in materials science engineering and holds more than 10 patent applications, with half being international registrations. -\\'\\n \\'Museum director Pawel Machcewicz had just struck a pose for a farewell photo. Fans of the museum had placed a symbolic barrier in front of the museum gates - with the aim, they said, of warding off \"attacks on cultural institutions.\" Then, suddenly-came the good news from the courts in Warsaw: The director did not have to vacate his post, as feared, on February 1, and the museum could continue on its mission. These are the latest scenes from the combative drama concerning the prestigious Museum of the Second World War in Poland. World War II began in Gdansk. Summit conferences to recall the war have regularly occured in the Polish port on the Baltic Sea. So in 2008, the Polish government - at the time led by Donald Tusk, who hails from Gdansk - thought it was high time to build a major museum there. And that is precisely part of the problem: The new, conservative government of the Law and Justive Party (PiS) has criticized the entire concept, aiming to massively alter the nearly completed museum and oust founding director Machcewicz after eight years of work. One of the largest cultural investments after 1989 Pawel Machcewicz laying the cornerstone of the museum in 2012 Yet it\\\\\\'s been a labor of love by the distinguished historian Machcewicz and his team - and one of the largest cultural investments in Poland since 1989, with the new building tagged at 104-million euros ($111-million). The architecture, created by the firm Kwadrat,-is grabbing - soaring up at an angle of 56 degrees. The collection includes everything from battle tanks to family keepsakes and the ship bell of the \"Wilhelm Gustloff\" that sank in 1945 carrying refugees. The many items of the collection and those on loan illustrate war and occupation, everyday life and resistance from across Europe. The museum focus is intended to be on the fate of the civilian population as, according to Machcewicz, Poland lost five million civilians and 200,000 soldiers in the war. A catalogue, in Polish and English, has also already been completed. Just as the museum was nearly finished, critics reared their heads. Piotr Glinski, culture minister of Poland\\\\\\'s conservative government, demanded three different appraisal reports - all of which came to the conclusion that too much emphasis was being placed on the \"human misfortune\" of the war while \"people\\\\\\'s inurement \" as the result of the war was being ignored. One of the appraisers, conservative historian Jan Zaryn, wrote that the museum\\\\\\'s approach bespeaks \"pseudo-universalism.\" More attention should have paid to Poland itself and its \"freedom-loving,\" proud population, he said. In addition, he noted construction deficits in the building. Court orders stop to compulsory museum merger- As a result, Minister Glinski called for the museum to merge with another institution, which is not really a museum at all, but more of a relatively tiny memorial to the Battle of Westerplatte. This was the-first battle of the war in September 1939,-where Polish soldiers were able to put up the greatest resistance to the Nazi Wehrmacht. The dramatic building features a 56-degree tilt Such a move would be-a-way for the government to oust Machcewicz and redesign-the museum. However, a Warsaw court ordered an injunction to stop the compulsory merger, a decision that was-reconfirmed earlier this week. The culture ministry plans to appeal the outcome. The city of Gdansk, which itself has a liberal-led government, has supported Machcewicz and the museum\\\\\\'s other founders. Following the submission of more than 1,000 petitions, Adam Bodnar, Poland\\\\\\'s official spokesman for civil liberties, has also responded. He criticized the aimed merger of the museums as it transgresses the law governing cultural activities: The hasty construction of the Westerplatte Museum, which would then \"merge\" with the Museum of the Second World War, would not be a prudent approach to dealing with budget funds, which the government is required to uphold, he said. Furthermore, he added that the minister\\\\\\'s methods were an impermissible intrusion into a municipality\\\\\\'s competencies. Machcewicz, for his part, is relieved following the latest court decision. He has set his sights on the beginning of March for the museum\\\\\\'s opening and then, \"everyone can form their own opinions,\" said the strident director. For now, a final verdict on the matter is not realistically expected for another two to three months. -\\'\\n \\'Born in Germany to a Jewish family, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) fled when Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. She spent time as a stateless refugee in France-and was deported to an internment camp under the Vichy regime. She emigrated to the United States in 1941, later becoming a US citizen. Having experienced first-hand the near collapse of an advanced civilization, she also became one of the first political theorists to analyze how totalitarian political movements could rise in the early-20th century. The roots of Nazism and Stalinism are described in her first major book, \"The Origins of Totalitarianism,\" originally published in English in 1951. It has been compulsory reading for many college students ever since, but the dense political work of over 500 pages isn\\\\\\'t typically a bestseller. It has been flying off bookshelves in the US since Trump\\\\\\'s inauguration; Amazon even briefly ran out of stock this week. These new Arendt fans are presumably trying to understand what Trump\\\\\\'s presidency-could lead to. As it might take a while for readers to get through her heavy essays, here-are a few spoilers:-\"Trump is not a totalitarian in her understanding; he incorporates what she calls \\\\\\'elements\\\\\\' of totalitarianism,\"-Roger Berkowitz, professor and head of the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanity at Bard College in New York, explained-in a recent DW interview. However, strong warning signs shouldn\\\\\\'t be ignored, added-Berkowitz:-Arendt believed that-\"one of the core elements of totalitarianism is-that it\\\\\\'s based in a movement... and-Trump has explicitly called himself the mouthpiece of a movement. That\\\\\\'s a very dangerous position for a politician.\"-- Populism: easy fixes in times of global anxiety Arendt\\\\\\'s analysis focuses on the events of that period.-Although her observations-obviously couldn\\\\\\'t explain everything about-today\\\\\\'s complex political developments, many are still revealing even now, as-the right-wing populism that\\\\\\'s spreading throughout Europe and the US is reminiscent in different ways of the situation in the 1920s and 30s that allowed the Nazis and Communists to rise. Her books provide insight into the mechanisms that allow-so many people to readily-accept lies in times of global uncertainty. While major newspapers --from \"The New York Times\" to \"The Washington Post\" --are revisiting her writings, social media users are widely sharing quotes such as this one: \\\\\\'Fantastic statements\\\\\\' seen as-tactical cleverness In such a context, repeated, simplified --and false - storylines, which blame-scapegoats and offer-easy solutions, are-preferred over deeper analysis leading to informed opinions. This approach was applied by totalitarian leaders such as Hitler, Arendt wrote. In this sense, Trump\\\\\\'s strategy-of placing blanket blame-Muslims or Mexicans for terrorism, crime or unemployment,-and claiming that a travel ban or a wall will be an easy solution,-is not new. According to Arendt, totalitarian leaders at the beginning of the 20th century based their propaganda on this assumption: Trump has pushed this approach to new extremes; even though there are more fact-checkers than ever dedicated to exposing his blatant-lies, the president\\\\\\'s-cunning tactic is to discredit-these reports as coming from-the established, \"dishonest\" media. Meanwhile,-his movement\\\\\\'s beliefs are-backed by widely available-alternative sources.--  The \\\\\\'banality of evil\\\\\\' In Arendt\\\\\\'s-reporting on the 1961 trial of one of the major organizers of the Holocaust, Adolf Eichmann, she famously came up with the phrase \"the banality of evil\" to describe her view that evil might not be as radical as one might-expect. The resulting book, \"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,\" explains how crimes were committed through people who thoughtlessly obeyed orders to conform to the masses. The definition of thoughtlessness that she provided in a work first published in 1958, \"The Human Condition,\" could just as well have been written to describe President Trump\\\\\\'s hastily drawn executive orders and his struggles to justify them:-- Of course, such quotes taken out of context may be easy and comforting to share online, but they do not reflect the entirety of Arendt\\\\\\'s ideas. Similarly, those hoping to find all answers to \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" are bound to-be disappointed.-Arendt didn\\\\\\'t pick that title herself --her publisher did. She believed the world was way too complex and messy to pinpoint the roots of totalitarianism, according to Berkowitz.- While revisiting her works, impossibly trying to predict if we\\\\\\'ll be overtaken by new forms of totalitarianism in the future, one can also find consolation in another of Arendt\\\\\\'s observations: She considered civil disobedience an essential part of the United States\\\\\\' political system - and-the country\\\\\\'s strong protest movements currently demonstrate this again. As she famously said:-\\'\\n \\'The sculptor Georg Korner, whose real name is Matthias K?rner, spent many years working on the reconstruction of the baroque faÃ§ade of the Berlin City Palace. Since 2013, he\\\\\\'s also been preparing hundreds of figures that align into a monumental artwork called \"Transit.\" The work deals with transitions in life. DW: What inspired you to work on the concept of \"transit\"? Georg Korner:-Transit has been a subtext of my entire life. Three and a half years ago, I wanted to create a tableau of people rushing with their luggage. It only covered one-square meter at first, but it just kept developing ever since. I was looking for the right format, and I finally found it with this large installation. Which themes does the work deal with? There\\\\\\'s the transition between life and death, for example. The \"Catrinas\" [Eds. female figures of death] from the Mexican \"D¨ªa de los muertos,\" the day of the dead, which symbolically show up at the table of the living. They eat and dance together and then they disappear again. The installation also includes the heretics of the Spanish Inquisition, undergoing auto-da-f¨¦, the public penance imposed by its judges; soldiers blinded by lethal gas during World War I; and the Devil in Dante\\\\\\'s \"Divine Comedy\" from the early Renaissance. There\\\\\\'s Lady Gaga and Batman, too. They are the transitory heroes of our times. They\\\\\\'re also constantly reinventing themselves;-they\\\\\\'re on the move.------ You started on this piece before the refugee crisis reached its peak in Germany. Do you still see it as a comment on the current situation in the world? I rather dealt with the issue more generally - from the Exodus of the Jews out of Egypt to the expulsion of Armenians, from the migration of early populations to the flight of German Jews, Communists and intellectuals over France to America. We have continuously been confronted with this issue-over thousands of years - and it has always moved me. And then came the moment for me to create this work. Two years ago, there were the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and now suicide bombers are also included in the installation.- The work is obviously currently relevant and politically charged. When I think about the narcissist populist Trump, who ordered his travel ban on Muslims on Holocaust Remembrance Day-of all days, then I view my installation with completely new energy. The work was therefore transformed by current events? Exactly, it develops along the way. It also offers a tree of possibilities. I am working on a derived, smaller project-about Leni Riefenstahl and Arno Breker [Eds. She was a filmmaker and he was a sculptor best known for their Nazi propaganda works]. They were also people in transition, who on one hand wanted to make art, but on the other made art on command. Where will \"Transit\" be shown? I have recently said that it works pretty well here in my studio. It\\\\\\'ll come out of here one day, but we don\\\\\\'t know where it will land yet. -\\'\\n \\'Senegal\\\\\\'s Sin¨¦ Saloum Delta is a biodiversity hotspot. Just 180 kilometers south-east of Dakar, the UNESCO world heritage site covers some 180,000 hectares, comprising wetlands, lakes, lagoons and marshes, as well as sandy coasts and dunes, terrestrial savannah areas and dry, open forest. It\\\\\\'s home to 400 species and plays a vital role in flood control and regulating the distribution of rainwater for the local people and wildlife. Lack of fresh water But due to drought, climate change and the uncontrolled logging of mangrove forests, the ground\\\\\\'s salinity has shot up \"?threatening the livelihoods of thousands of people living there. One of them is Khadiome Ndongue, a resident of Sadio Ba near the west coast town of Foundiougne. Every day she draws water from a well in the community vegetable garden. The water from the well dug in 1988 has gradually turned salty over the last twenty years. During the dry season, in the wetland along the Saloum river, underground fresh water retreats, letting seawater in. This is known as saltwater intrusion - the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers \"?making fresh water sources undrinkable. Sadio Ba village has had to abandon rice cultivation because of- this salination. \"The salt has caused a lot of damage in the fields. The scale of our agriculture is decreasing more and more because we don\\\\\\'t use the salted ground,\"?she said. Khadiome Ndongue relies on the well for water \"We can only use the arable land. Our yields are low and we have problems feeding families and selling our crops like before. Because of the salt we\\\\\\'ve abandoned the rice fields. Instead, we grow groundnuts, maize, and millet,\"?said Ndongue. A few years ago a visiting engineer suggested dropping bags of rice and millet husks, a fine inedible powder residue made from pounding grain,- into the well, in order to reduce salinity. It has worked, at least in the contained area of the well. Djigane Mboup, another villager, has taken up rearing chickens to make ends meet. \"Salt has really damaged our land. Before, you could earn 50,000 CFA francs (80 euro) from your crop. Now you\\\\\\'ll barely make 30,000 CFA. It\\\\\\'s been like that since 1999 or 2000. Last year was bad, but this year, it\\\\\\'s even worse,\"?he said. The Sin¨¦ Saloum Delta has been identified as the most important place in Senegal, and even in West Africa, for its population of bird species. The goliath heron, the great egret and the grey heron are a common sight. Uncontrolled logging of mangroves Sey¨¦ advises residents on dealing with salinification But climate change, drought, and the uncontrolled cutting of mangroves, a natural saltwater barrier, are increasing the salinity of the ground with huge impacts on the delta\\\\\\'s unique biosphere, says Ball¨¦ Seye, project manager at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). -- \"Mangrove forests help stop the advancement of salinisation in the crop fields,\"?said Seye. \"Now all these mangroves are just relics, destroyed. The result is that there\\\\\\'s a strong advance of salinisation in the fields and especially pastoral zones. No grass grows on this land ,so you can imagine the difficulties herders will have in a few years,\"?he said. To improve environmental conditions, the IUCN launched three pilot initiatives under the Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) project, in six villages in Senegal. The first initiative was to develop ways to regulate the exploitation of forestry and fisheries. The second was to construct anti-salt barriers with local materials and lastly, to restore 90 hectares of forest to improve soil quality. Sadio Ba residents have built anti-salt barriers to retain humidity and keep salt water off the land. A new village forest Villagers were trained to grow a nursery of forestry species that can resist increased salt levels in the soil. In Sadio Ba village, 100 square metres of land have been fenced off so that trees can be planted, and will serve as a managed forest area. \"Here, the major difficulty for women is access to firewood. If there\\\\\\'s a village forest set up with rules, it will enable women in the long term and in the medium term to have wood for fuel for their consumption, and to replant at the same time,\"?said Seye. Around the world, wetlands continue to be drained and reclaimed for farming, as they are seen as a barrier to agriculture. According to the Ramsar Convention, while there is a need for more food production from land, the conversion of wetlands has far reaching impacts on their own ecosystem, and communities living off the ecosystem wetlands provide. World Wetlands Day is celebrated every year on 2 February. It marks the day the Convention on Wetlands was adopted in 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar. This year\\\\\\'s the theme is Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction highlighting the vital roles healthy wetlands play in reducing the impacts of extreme events, like floods. -\\'\\n \\'It\\\\\\'s a leisurely 9-kilometer (5.6-mile)-bike ride from the center of Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany to Rappenw?rt, where a narrow sliver of translucent green wetland lies nestled between the Rhine River and a raised earth embankment. \"It\\\\\\'s an original meander bed from when the Rhine still flowed in its natural course. It flowed in here in a giant loop,\" says Andreas Wolf, a biologist and head of the Nature Conservation Center Karlsruhe-Rappenw?rt, as he walks along the edge of the wetland, crunching over stones, shells and patches of ice. Now, in midwinter, the meander\\\\\\'s muddy bank is edged with bulbous canary grass and sedges, fallen tree trunks full of woodpecker holes and bare, straggly trees. But it\\\\\\'s these unspectacular-looking trees Wolf is excited about. Woodpecker holes hint at some of the life supported here, even in the depths of winter \"This is a white willow forest, a softwood forest. It\\\\\\'s an area that is often flooded, and the white willow can withstand up to 300 days a year with its feet in water,\" he explains, pointing to wide crowns which will burst into shimmering pale green foliage in spring. A number of thin saplings dot the bank - a great sign, says Wolf, that regular flooding is sweeping away undergrowth and bringing in the new sediment that white willows need-to germinate.- On the opposite side of the wetland, it\\\\\\'s a different story. In a copse of mature white willows, some around 20 meters high and 100 years old, there\\\\\\'s not a sapling in sight. \"When these trees fall down, that\\\\\\'s it,\" Wolf sighs. \"In principle, this wetland is connected to the Rhine, but because of the stone groin at the front, the current just doesn\\\\\\'t flow swiftly to create the flood dynamic needed.\" Fertile floodplains It\\\\\\'s the flow and ebb of the floods that made this area so special. Up until 200 years ago, the Rhine meandered, curled and inundated its way from its source in the Swiss Alps all the way to the Dutch-coast, where it empties into the North Sea. For several hundred kilometers downstream of the Swiss city of Basel, the course of the Rhine was particularly unpredictable. Here, in an area known as the Upper Rhine, which runs along the border between France and Germany, the river split into countless tributaries that looped through a giant rift valley bound by the Black Forest on one side and France\\\\\\'s Vosges-mountains on the other. Swollen by spring snow melts or summer rains, the valley could flood up to a width of 40 kilometers, at times sweeping away whole villages, explains Jost Armbruster, an engineer and biologist in the Nature Conservation Unit at the Karlsruhe Regional Council.- These meandering floodwaters created a complex and rich mosaic of different habitats ranging from open rocky islands formed by gravel swept down from the Alps, to low lying swampy areas and the moist softwood forests at Rappenw?rt, which thrive in the rich silts and clays dumped during a flood. The Rhine has undergone extensive \"correction\" to accommodate boats With so many diverse conditions in one area, the floodplain forests have a rich biodiversity. Some 9,000 plant species, as well as a rich variety of animals, birds and insects, including 55 different types of dragonfly and 170 types of wild bee, are found here. Penned in and parched Because of the area\\\\\\'s ecological importance, in 2008 the Upper Rhine floodplain became one of only ten cross-border sites certified under the international Ramsar wetlands convention. But like others in Europe, the Upper Rhine\\\\\\'s floodplain forests are being parched of their vital floodwaters. Two hundred years ago this year, the ground was broken on-a colossal project, just five kilometers away from-Rappenw?rt.-The engineer Johann Gottfried Tulla was in charge of the Rhine-\"Correction\" program, which aimed to straighten the-Rhine and reduce flooding.- During the past two hundred years, the Rhine has been put into a kind of straightjacket - its bends have been straightened and groins have been added to increase the water flow for the barges transporting cargo along the river. Its banks have been reinforced and it\\\\\\'s been hemmed in by dikes. It\\\\\\'s estimated that the area of floodplain between Basel and Karlsruhe has plummeted from 1,000 square kilometers to 130 square kilometers - a loss of 87 percent. Sixty percent of its alluvial forests have already disappeared. On both the French and German side of the Rhine, there are efforts large and small to improve the conditions of the Upper Rhine. As part of a European Union-sponsored LIFE conservation project, for example, two Rhine branches that had become separated from the Rhine were recently reconnected. White willows need sediment left by flooding to germinate Reshaping and reviving \"The mud and silt that had deposited in them in the last decades could be washed out, making the tributary bottoms gravelly again,\" says Armbruster, the project manager. \"Certain types of migratory fish, such as the salmon and the allis shad, a type of herring, need these gravel bottoms to spawn.\" Three artificial islands were also built as part of the LIFE project. Their gravelly banks are vital feeding and nesting grounds for wading birds such as the ruddy and the little ringed plover, which only nest on open ground. Projects such as this one, which was supported by the EU as well as local and state authorities, show a changing awareness of the urgent need to save the remnants of the Rhine wetlands.

(Photo Illustration 21WIREâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Shawn Helton) \\\\nThe Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWashington, D.C. â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Billionaire globalist financier George Sorosâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump â\\\\x80\\\\x94 exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. \\\\nWednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. \\\\nIn light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSorosâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmericans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results \\\\nHundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. \\\\nTonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesdayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s presidential election. \\\\nThe gatherings â\\\\x80\\\\x93 organized by MoveOn.org and allies â\\\\x80\\\\x93 will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. \\\\nWithin two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSoros Agit-Prop Empire \\\\nLast year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros. \\\\nPM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a â\\\\x80\\\\x9c circle of activists,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cinadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of â\\\\x80\\\\x98The Occupy Movementâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 ( aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year â\\\\x80\\\\x93 all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. \\\\nBack in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthreshold for an endorsement.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAs we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as â\\\\x80\\\\x98activistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 attempted to take away Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x98strength in numbersâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. \\\\nIn a Politico article in early 2016 entitled â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter ,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cMajor donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIt worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to â\\\\x80\\\\x9cboostâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign . Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. \\\\nLook for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98SOCIAL ENGINEERINGâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGOâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s and social media.

These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist â\\\\x80\\\\x9cprogressiveâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d agenda is at play â\\\\x80\\\\x93 eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial â\\\\x80\\\\x98colorâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 upheavals, and where possible â\\\\x80\\\\x93 weakening a countryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publicâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s political perspective. \\\\nThis is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization â\\\\x80\\\\x98color revolutionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. \\\\nOverseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. \\\\nInside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weekâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s protests. \\\\nIt still remains to be seen if Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. \\\\nCertainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s total silence over their own partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s role in fomenting this weekâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s unrest â\\\\x80\\\\x93 one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable â\\\\x80\\\\x93 to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. \\\\nBut one thing is for sure â\\\\x80\\\\x93 thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. \\\\nLegal Action Against Soros Groups \\\\nIn a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organizationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s activists and George Soros for $550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. \\\\nThe father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly â\\\\x80\\\\x9cinciting a war on policeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that led to the death of his son. \\\\nThe lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhile Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect.

I am also sure that this may not be the best place to make any form of impact as let\\'s be honest. I do not think many muslim\\'s reside on this website and if they do, then I am sure they will defend their side just as usual. Tommy Robinson (also known as Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon) is the co-founder and leader of the English Defence League. Some of you who know this man may already, may have opinions about him because of his creation of the EDL and what some of its members have been known to behave like. However, Tommy Robinson in my eyes is one of the very few, if not the only person to stand up to the islamist movement in this country. It is a good thing he is around whether you respect him or not as islamists have one thing in common, they have a lot to loose and also a lot to gain either way. Just like anyone that stands up to a movement like islam, its always a difficult one. Considering England has been asleep for to long to even notice what is going on under its nose. Everyone thinks England is promoting multiculturalism by allowing Islam to move freely within this country but islam and its ways are not to get along peacefully, they want western cultures out completely. If left to their own devices, England will be taken over within 10 - 20 years or sooner. Here is a short video of Tommy Robinson travelling through his local town and regardless of him being the main man of the EDL he is not being abusive to anyone yet this is the kind of treatment a born and raised English man gets in his own home town. As you can tell in the video above. Disgusting behaviour by disgusting people who are using their faith as a scape goat to instil fear, scaremonger and literally drive out English people from there home towns. How? Because people of England are sitting back and not sharing their fears about such extremism in their own country. Also a big shame is that the younger generation are being taught to accept anyone and everyone and although this is a beautiful message to portray this is the root cause of Islam continuing to grow. You will see in many debates get side tracked by blank statements made by younger generations about such political points only to end up with a nonsensical opinion that gets us nowhere. The older generation are tired of fighting, so we have only this moment in time to get those capable, those noticing changes in the UK and America and many other places to realise what is occurring before there is no one of the right age to know how things have changed. Desensitisation is the worry here. There is so much to cover a topic like this could last pages and pages, however I just want to point out a few things. The rest should be up to conversation. The current state of moderate muslims is not a thing. A muslim lives by the faith of Islam and if they had to side with one or the other, they would side with Islam. This should be cause of concern because even though they deem themselves not the same or as severe, they are in fact, just as severe. Basically they are sleeper cells being created within our very own country. They are not here to live peacefully along side us either. They are here to promote their faith and grow, growing means pushing more and more on other faiths that for many years have lived together, peacefully. Only until now, has this country had problems like this. I am not here to promote Tommy Robinson but I am here to state that this mans points should be heard. If you have the time now or again, give this video below a watch. He explains very well where things have gone, are going and will end up. Not just in the UK but everywhere in the world that does nothing about this. edit on 27-10-2016 by BlackProject because: (no reason given)\"\\n \"20 Shares\\\\n3 16 0 1\\\\nIraq\\'s al-Sumaria satellite television Quote: d an unnamed security source that claimed Mosul residents on Friday evening killed ISIS terrorists serving as security for the city\\'s main prison, resulting in the liberation of at least 45 prisoners.\\\\nThis comes as Iraqi forces and their allies close in on the ISIS stronghold after launching full-scale operations October 17 to liberate the city.\\\\nSimultaneous operstions are to liberate the city, particular from the east, whilst securing Iraq\\'s borders with Syria.\\\\nThe offensive on Mosul is expected to become the biggest battle fought in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and it could require a massive humanitarian relief operation.\\\\nRecommended For You Iraqi Soldier Battling ISIS in Mosul Reunited with His Family After Two Years of Estrangement\\\\nIt\\'s a heartwarming moment amid the carnage of the battle to liberate Mosul.

The below is true, even if it\\\\\\'s not as exciting as CGI videos... My main reason for posting is about one of the (very few) times I saw \\\\\\'stuff\\\\\\'. Back in Summer of July,1974 I went on a camping trip to Possum Kingdom Lake in West Texas with a friend Robert, (my last trip as a single guy before I got married the following month). The trip was a lot of canoeing, swimming, cliff diving, snorkeling, and camping out at night beneath the stars, no tent, just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly. (Robert and I were best friends and also worked together too) Anyway, one really, REALLY dark chilly and moonless night about 9:30pm or so, we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot (elevated with no distractions) to look at the night sky, I had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good, (I was 21) my friend was 20. He partook of the herb and drank beer daily and I consumed a few beers daily, by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep, the heat of the West Texas day really took it out of us. The campsite was only accessed by boat, we used a rental canoe, so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being 20-30 foot high. (They seemed a LOT taller to me!) We camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day. So this one night I was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another, I then saw, it, and said, \"Look right there!\", he having binoculars he looked at where I had pointed, saw \"it\" and got pretty excited. He finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what I saw was the following... Slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent, or semi-transparent and faint bluish looking sphere, a clear \\\\\\'bubble really, moving at a speed I remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going, but not so much faster or slower than any plane/jet traffic would be, in my estimation. It was going South and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth. We both assumed it was a satellite. Exciting stuff, but then one of us (I really can\\\\\\'t remember who) noticed another one, this time coming from the East, they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude. When they were getting a little too close for comfort (at least for us!) the one that came from the East shot a light bluish light at the Southbound sphere, it wasn\\\\\\'t laser-like at all (I don\\\\\\'t think) but it appeared more like a v-shaped beam from a flashlight shot at it. It lasted all of a second, and I am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time. The light flash made the Southbound one turn Westward, now going almost the same direction as the one from the East, making them both going in the same direction, actually the one that got flashed didn\\\\\\'t make a 90 degree turn, it was really going more of a path more like West-southwest more like 87 degrees or so, just guessing now. When I say that it turned, it turned abruptly, not at all anything like any plane would do, that struck us both as being odd, no curving involved at all. We watched them until they both grew dim from the distance, both staying in a straight line to their (intended?) destination. Of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other, but nope. I could be wrong on the speed and the directions, but the rest is completely accurate. The really sharp turn back then was unheard of, we hear it all of the time now, years ago though it wasn\\\\\\'t talked about at all, not even in the tabloids. This is why this really stood out out to me all of these years, that almost 90 degree turn. To be honest I just didn\\\\\\'t understand what we had just seen. We finally got to sleep that night, I don\\\\\\'t know how long it took us, but we did, but after a few hours (around 3-ish am) Robert woke me up and said, \"Listen!\", and I heard footsteps, that scared us pretty good \\\\\\'cause we had gotten so worked up earlier, I guess. heheh We listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us, well, we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep. (I have to admit, O.K., yeah, I did partake myself, but only a little bit, I wasn\\\\\\'t into it like him but I was on vacation, that made us both VERY paranoid, I guess) Anyway, the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing, the bread\\\\\\'s plastic wrapper was there but no bread. CREEPY. A few years later my boss (who I had told all of this to and he made fun of me) told me that the same thing happened to him, his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river, they determined that it was a raccoon, which, they do this sort of thing, I know now. Now to regular people that might not seem like much, especially now days, here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily. Still, for back then it was REALLY something. My older brother (by 3-1/2 years) and I were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of Caddo Lake in East Texas around 1981 in the Spring, May I think, and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers. (That\\\\\\'s all they were known as back then) Our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard, it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties, after all, that was its heyday. As we stared at the sky in the back of my pick-up I mentioned the bluish sphere that I had seen years before at Possum Kingdom Lake, he being quiet through the entire story, he wasn\\\\\\'t that talkative really, and within 5 minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one. (I had my own binoculars this time!) I was really amazed, it was exactly as what I had seen before, I mean exactly! Nothing major happened though, it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right, and that was that. My brother was never a believer anyway, maybe had it landed it would change his mind. We saw several regular ol\\\\\\' satellites afterwards too. Why I even bring this up is that when I first started coming here around 2008 (lurking) I read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing I did, with the slightly v-shaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away, I\\\\\\'d REALLY love to read that again, it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed. I say, \"confirmed\" because that friend, Robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a LOT of people at work. We hardly talked about anything else on that trip, and especially on the way home too.

Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE .

They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the stateâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s exit, or the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCalexit,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d as they call it. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d reads Yes California â\\\\x80\\\\x99s official website. \\\\nThe groupâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s page reads on: \\\\nAlthough charity is part of our culture, when you consider that Californiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.\\\\nIt is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. \\\\nYes California â\\\\x80\\\\x99s website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. \\\\nOne blog post on their page draws parallels with a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCalexitâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and the recent referendum known as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrexitâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. \\\\nThe push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. \\\\nModoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . \\\\nIn 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson. \\\\nJoseph Jankowski is a contributor for Planet Free Will.com .

I found the story quite interesting, and I hope you will too. Background: My dad was a pilot with 30+ years of experience flying all manner of civilian, military, and commercial aircraft. He was a naturally humble and quiet individual--never given to boasting or exageration. Like many pilots, he was wired to be logical, mathematical, and mechanical; he was also a supreme skeptic where all things supernatural and speculative are concerned. He preferred direct experience and scientific inquiry to wild tales. His story: One day he came back from a trip he flew (commercial flight) to Mexico. Over a beer, I casually asked him about his trip. He looked at me, cocked one eyebrow and replied, \"I saw something I can\\\\\\'t explain.\" This got my attention. On the layover, he and another pilot went out for dinner. Walking back along the beach at night, they both noticed a distant light moving along a fixed vector at a constant speed. They kept watching it, and were wondering about distance and elevation, thinking perhaps it was either a satellite or a high-flying aircraft--nothing out of the ordinary. Then it came to a complete stop, reversed direction 180 degrees, and whizzed off so fast it was out of sight in less than a second or two. So my first response was, \"Do you think it was a UFO?\" Again with the cocked eyebrow he said, \"I don\\\\\\'t want to use that word. All I will say is that what we witnessed completely and utterly defies all laws of aerodynamics that I\\\\\\'m familiar with. I\\\\\\'m not aware of any aircraft--military or otherwise--that can do that. It\\\\\\'s beyond my abilities to explain; that\\\\\\'s all I\\\\\\'m willing to say.\" To contrast this story, I will also say that one time we were watching a campy, early 80\\\\\\'s Fox program that was reporting on the US government harboring aliens. At one point in the story, they started talking about a particular installation in the mountains of Nevada (not area 51) that\\\\\\'s being used as a landing zone for UFO\\\\\\'s. Dad started laughing so hard I thought he was going to fall off the couch. He looked at me and said, \"I know what they do there.\" I said, \"And???\" He replied, \"I can\\\\\\'t tell you that, but I CAN tell you they\\\\\\'re NOT landing UFO\\\\\\'s.\" Total buzz kill. Anyway, that\\\\\\'s the story I wanted to relate in the hopes that others can add their own.

She has not only illegally declared herself â\\\\x80\\\\x9cleaderâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an iron-fisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. \\\\nDuring elections earlier this year, Myanmarâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her childrenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdefacto leaderâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of Myanmar. \\\\nCanadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s The Globe and Mail in an article titled, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cStÃ©phane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the â\\\\x80\\\\x98de factoâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 leader of Myanmar,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d would note that Canadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s government recognized this legal side-stepping, stating: \\\\nDion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmarâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s foreign minister, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe de facto national leaderâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of her country â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whoâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSuu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmarâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. \\\\nIn essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman whoâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Western backers â\\\\x80\\\\x93 particularly in the United States and United Kingdom â\\\\x80\\\\x93 have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian \\\\nAnother myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for â\\\\x80\\\\x9chuman rights.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this self-serving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. \\\\nIn addition to escalating violence targeting the nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Rohingyaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s population, several activists online have been sent to jail for â\\\\x80\\\\x9cinsultingâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d the ruling government and Western-backed media fronts and organizations. \\\\nMyanmarâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Eleven Media Group (EMG) in its article, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cFacebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state: \\\\nA Facebook user named Zaw Zaw (aka Nga Pha) was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. \\\\nHe has been charged under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cHeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor [posted on Facebook],â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34-year-old resident of North Okkalapa Township. \\\\nAround 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou deserved it for insulting a good person.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe article also admits: \\\\nThe Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing (aka A Nyar Thar), the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. \\\\nAung Myint Tun (aka Ko Pho Htaung), a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. \\\\nAnother man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. \\\\nHla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the Commander-in-Chief. \\\\nEMG â\\\\x80\\\\x93 ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous military-led government by Reporters without Borders â\\\\x80\\\\x93 would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmarâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s laws to silence its own critics, claiming: \\\\nEleven Media Group (EMG) also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. \\\\nOne would expect such a tidal wave of abuse â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world â\\\\x80\\\\x93 to be met with sweeping condemnation from the Westâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders â\\\\x80\\\\x93 yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off \\\\nThe Westâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the military-led government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyiâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s breaches of Western standards of â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdemocracyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and â\\\\x80\\\\x9chuman rights,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. \\\\nThe overt nature of both the Westâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s and Suu Kyiâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hypocrisy illustrates that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdemocracy,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9crule of law,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and â\\\\x80\\\\x9chuman rightsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power â\\\\x80\\\\x93 hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could â\\\\x80\\\\x93 because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their faux-nongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. \\\\nInternational audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric â\\\\x80\\\\x93 supporting supposed â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpro-democracyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpro-human rightsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power. \\\\nTony Cartalucci, Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher and writer, especially for the online magazine â\\\\x80\\\\x9cNew Eastern Outlookâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d .\\'\\n \\'Good Day AD I would have to say that we are under ATTACK by the BUSH/CLINTON/OBAMA Crime Cartel First  hit VP pick Mike Pences Plane and the other Plane fires etc Cause ? computer induced crash and engine failure&#39;s etc. ZZ\\'\\n \\'By Justin Gardner As the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline nears its planned Missouri River crossing, protesters are remaining strong in their fight to protect the... \\'\\n \"link So this is from an Argentinian conference Assange spoke with via telephone.

This whole situation is so hard to read, with talks of Wikileaks being compromised, or pressure on to Ecuador trickling down to Assange. Just thought I\\'d share.\"\\n \\'A House committee voted on Tuesday to eliminate an independent election commission charged with helping states improve their voting systems as President Donald Trump erroneously claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The party-line vote came less than two days after Trump vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his accusations of election fraud. \"We\\\\\\'re going to look at it very, very carefully,\" Trump said of voter fraud in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday. \"It has to do with the registration, and when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted.\" Reports that Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting last month that 3 to 5 million ballots were cast illegally during the 2016 race were met with discomfort on Capitol Hill. While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they haven\\\\\\'t pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for congressional leadership. The vote in the House Administration Committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party\\\\\\'s rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators. Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste. They\\\\\\'ve been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success. \"If we\\\\\\'re looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,\" said Rep. Gregg Harper, the committee chairman. \"We don\\\\\\'t need fluff.\" Harper said he hadn\\\\\\'t spoken to Trump about the legislation. \"He\\\\\\'s certainly welcome to call me at any time,\" he said. The bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference. \"At a time when the vast majority of the country\\\\\\'s voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,\" said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice. The committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14 million in the general election. But by accepting the grant, a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign. President Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign\\\\\\'s spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year. Money for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers\\\\\\' returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes. The legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction. It is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures.\\'\\n \\'Before returning to Washington, the former president dove into an aquatic and athletic challenge with his friend, Virgin Group founder and billionaire Richard Branson, while vacationing on the British Virgin Islands with former first lady Michelle Obama. Now that Obama is free from many Secret Service-imposed restrictions that did not allow him to partake in activities like surfing, Branson offered Obama the chance to learn how to kitesurf. But to make things more interesting, Branson took on a challenge of his own. \"We decided to set up a friendly challenge: Could Barack learn to kitesurf before I learned to foilboard? We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest,\" Branson wrote in a post on Virgin.com. Kitesurfing is riding on a surfboard while holding onto a kite and foilboarding is riding a surfboard with a hydrofoil that goes into the water lifts the board above the surface. Following a few days of training, the challenge was on and Obama kitesurfed his way to victory. \"We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 metres, three feet above the water,\" Branson wrote. \"I was feeling very pleased with myself, only to look over and see Barack go 100 metres on his kiteboard! I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory.\"\\'\\n \\'Beyonce and her husband rapper Jay Z announced Wednesday on Instagram that the pop star is pregnant with twins. \"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two,\" wrote Beyonce on Instagram in a post signed \"The Carters,\" which is Jay Z\\\\\\'s real last name. The post included a photo of the star dressed in panties, a bra and a veil, revealing her baby bump. She is kneeling beside a gigantic floral arrangement with her hands on her visibly pregnant belly. Some fans were quick to point out that Beyonce\\\\\\'s announcement coincided with the start of Black History Month, which is observed through the month of February. The singer has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement against racism and police brutality, which became evident in the video to the first single of her \"Lemonade\" album, \"Formation.\" That album, released about nine months ago, also stirred debate-for hinting at Jay Z\\\\\\'s unfaithfulness, which was never confirmed. \"Lemonade\" is poised to win a Grammy on February 12. While Beyonce is known to be a personal friend of Barack Obama and his-family, and she actively supported Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s presidential campaign, this week\\\\\\'s happy announcement is certainly politically untainted. After nearly two weeks of emotional social media posts for and against President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s initial actions, some users welcomed a hiatus from news of the latest presidential escapades. That didn\\\\\\'t stop others, however, from finding the political angle to the Carter family\\\\\\'s news.  - Instagram record for most likes Beyonce has over 92 million Instagram followers and her post racked up over seven million likes within hours, breaking Selena Gomez\\\\\\'s record for a photo of her sipping a soda that has over six million likes. The star did not share the news on Twitter, but that didn\\\\\\'t stop her fans from taking to the platform: their posts using the hashtag #beyoncetewins have been flowing ever since the announcement, not only to celebrate, but also to offer-their two cents: Name suggestions abounded - most of which played on the name of Beyonce and Jay Z\\\\\\'s five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. Meanwhile, others put themselves in the shoes of Blue Ivy herself. In April, Beyonce is scheduled to headline the renowned Coachella Festival, which runs for two weeks in southern California. Her belly will likely be unmissable at that time. The star has been open about experiencing a miscarriage before giving birth to her first child, Blue Ivy, in 2012. She\\\\\\'s said the heartbeat she heard during that first pregnancy was \"the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life.\" Other stars with twins include Julia Roberts, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. kbm/eg/als (AFP, AP) -\\'\\n \\'He has got to go after him , he is the one causing al the trouble around the worl and is 100% proof that what Trump says about crooked and corruption is true .

The report, led by researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, contradicts previous studies that suggested that injuries such as concussion resulted mainly from full-on head impacts with other players or collisions with the goal posts. A total of 222 amateur players were studied over the course of the six-month study, which divided the participants into four groups dependent on how often they headed the ball. The top group was defined by heading the ball over 125 times every two weeks, while the bottom group headed the ball just four times in the same period. The study, published in the February 1 edition of Neurology, found that the group with the most headers was three times more likely to have symptoms --dizziness, feeling dazed, stopping play for medical attention or even losing consciousness --than those who rarely used their heads while playing. \"These results show that heading the ball is indeed related to concussion symptoms, which is contrary to a recent study that suggested that collisions were responsible for most concussions,\"?concluded the study\\\\\\'s author Michael L. Lipton. \"Our study suggests that you don\\\\\\'t need an overt collision to warrant this type of concern.\"?Previous warnings Factors that may lead to long-term neurological issues in soccer have long been studied, with most reports to date suggesting that single or repeated concussions do lead to neurological problems later in life. Such problems are even more prevalent in American football, where a five-year legal battle between the National Football League and former players concluded in 2016, with the league agreeing to pay out $1 billion to cover the medical payments of players for the next 65 years; with league actuaries estimating that just under 30 percent may go on to develop Alzheimer\\\\\\'s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other neural conditions. Yet this study is one of the first to suggest that even minor contact, such as heading an inflated, leather ball, can have long-term effects on a player\\\\\\'s health. \"These [previous]-studies did not actually measure heading,\"-Dr. Lipton wrote in his report. \"And thus they were unable to separate the relative contributions of intentional and unintentional head impacts.\"\\'\\n \\'Life under the new US president isn\\\\\\'t easy for scientists and science reporters. Donald Trump is a denier of man-made climate change and has called global warming a Chinese-propagated-myth. He has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services not to send out any press releases or update their website content for the time being. And he banned the National Parks Service from tweeting. In short, Trump has made many, many enemies in the science community within his first days in office. But scientists, science writers and their supporters are not taking the attacks lying down. They have formed a political action committee (PAC) to get more scientists elected to public office. According to its mission statement, the group called \\\\\\'314 Action\\\\\\' was founded because the US needs \"new leaders who understand that climate change is real and are motivated to find a solution.\" Many of the agencies affected by what they perceive as a presidential gag order have also set up \"rogue\" Twitter accounts from which they keep disseminating information. Those supporting verified facts, research and freedom of speech will also descend on Washington D.C. in a \"March for Science,\" a planned gathering inspired by the hugely successful Women\\\\\\'s Marches that saw millions of people across the world take to the streets to protest Trump\\\\\\'s policies on January 21. The slogan on the march\\\\\\'s website is \"Science, not silence.\" On Wednesday, the organizers announced via Twitter that the march will take place on Earth Day, April 22, 2017. In their mission statement the organizers write: \"The March for Science champions publicly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity.\" Scientific method \\\\\\'on trial\\\\\\' in the US \"Scientists have battled the political and ideological forces against concepts such as evolution and climate change for years,\" Elizabeth Hadly, professor of biology, geological and environmental sciences at Stanford University, told British newspaper The Guardian. Hadly is ready to march because she sees the scientific discourse under attack in the US. That view is shared by science writers as well. Journalists who cover science and share important research and newly discovered facts with the public are worried about what their work will look like under Trump. \"It\\\\\\'s a dangerous time for society when the scientific method is on trial,\" Aleszu Bajak, a freelance science journalist based in Boston, told DW via email. \"I fear the muzzling of government scientists and the obscuring - and wholesale deletion - of government data pertaining to climate, health, or any topic deemed too \\\\\\'political\\\\\\' by the administration.\" More and more people are getting involved and are making their voices heard. Trump\\\\\\'s ban on Muslims entering the US is also riling scientists. \"Science is an international enterprise, and everyone is worried about what impact the travel ban will have on scientists from other countries,\" Apoorva Mandavilli, editor-in-chief of autism site Spectrum and a freelance science journalist, wrote to DW. \"Scientists who have never been politically active are getting engaged, tweeting about politics, and planning to march.\" Whether Trump\\\\\\'s policies will have a direct effect on how publicly scientists dare to talk about their research remains to be seen. \"I haven\\\\\\'t noticed a chilling effect yet on how researchers discuss their work; just fears that it might happen,\" Umair Ifan, staff writer at environment news outlet E&E News, wrote to DW. \"It\\\\\\'s too soon to tell.\" The upcoming March for Science at least is a sign that large numbers of scientists are not afraid to show their dissatisfaction or even anger with the Trump administration.\\'\\n \\'Before he was inaugurated, fears swirled-that-President Donald Trump would make good on his environmentally unfriendly campaign rhetoric. After just a-week-in office, those fears may already be being-realized. Experts from the Washington-based global research organization the World Resources Institute (WRI) have-warned that environmental democracy could be under threat. According to the WRI, one of the first troubling signs on the horizon for environmental democracy --or inclusive decision-making on environmental issues---is the Trump administrations media blackout on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Just days into Trump\\\\\\'s presidency, emails were sent to EPA staff barring them from speaking to reporters, posting updates on social media or sending press releases. All incoming media requests would be screened by the administration from now on, according to the emails. Other agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture and the National Parks Service, were issued similar gagging orders. Clouding scientific transparency Political appointees are also exerting more oversight over the EPA\\\\\\'s scientific communications. Scientists at the agency were told-their scientific findings must be-reviewed on a \"case by case basis\"---at least for now --before they can be released to the public. This-includes-routine pollution-monitoring data. The WRI blog-says preventing citizens from having access to accurate, timely information that has not been editorialized or modified will \"obstruct an integral component of democratic policymaking.\" \"Citizens can neither understand nor participate in environmental decision-making without having access to objective, scientific information and data,\" the WRI-says, adding: \"As a public institution, the EPA is legally required to provide access to critical environmental information, such as air and water pollution monitoring reports.\"  US climate scientists held a rally against attacks by the Trump administration The blog-notes-this would be the first time the agency\\\\\\'s scientific data --including figures on-climate change --required-review by officials-before publication.- Legally, Trump cannot abolish the EPA, something-he pledged to do-during his election campaign. But he could still do much to wreck it over the next four years by slashing its staff and budget. Elizabeth Moses, environmental democracy specialist at the WRI and one of the blog post\\\\\\'s authors, told DW, \"People need to have objective access about environmental issues and the EPA plays an incredibly essential role in helping to educate people, businesses and a variety of other shareholders in terms of what those environmental facts are, so they can participate in decision-making. \"Anything that prevents people from getting that objective information is going to jeopardize-their ability to make well-informed decisions.\" Bypassing the public The president\\\\\\'s executive order to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines,-without consulting-with the State Department and bypassing further public consultations, also looms as a major threat. \"Public participation is the bedrock of environmental democracy; yet the new administration\\\\\\'s plans may undercut this pillar of good governance,\"-wrote the WRI.  President Donald Trump signs an executive order to advance the Keystone XL pipeline Miranda Schreurs, professor of Environment and Climate Policy at the Technical University of Munich, told DW the growing encroachment on environmental democracy was \"shocking\"-and criticized the administration\\\\\\'s apparent bid to censor climate science. \"Regardless of which administration has been in power in the past, be it democrat or republican, the US has been a leader on environment science, and any action to damage this would risk climate science and the reputation of the USA as a leader on these questions,\"-Schreurs told DW. \"The real threat is that science is being discredited for what it is. It suggests that science needs to be vetted by political appointees and as soon as you do that, it appears politically motivated and that threatens a fundamental pillar of our society: the concept of objective science.\" She added: \"It does strike at the heart of democracy, because one of the key pillars of any democracy is to have access to information for its citizens.\" Given the EPA\\\\\\'s legal requirement to provide environmental information, Schreurs said any attempts by the Trump administration to stymie this could lead to legal action. \"The federal budget is being used to collate this information and it\\\\\\'s a transparency requirement that you know what\\\\\\'s happening with the information.-So yes, there could easily be grounds for lawsuits.\"\\'\\n \\'Going in search of people who will speak on the record about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame at a sweets fair is like going to a tobacco convention to talk about cancer. Everyone can see the elephant in the room but no one wants to chew it. And there\\\\\\'s a palpable sense of anxiety. No one wants to say the wrong thing.- I spent a day at Cologne\\\\\\'s international sweets fair (ISM 2017) on Tuesday, and I can confirm that watching the sweets industry side-step questions about artificial sweeteners is as cringe-worthy as witnessing the birth of a new dance. That\\\\\\'s true even for those companies that don\\\\\\'t use artificial sweeteners. Off the record they\\\\\\'ll happily tell about the nasty aftertaste of artificial sweeteners, that you have to mask it, adding chemicals upon chemicals. Or they\\\\\\'ll tell you about Aspartame\\\\\\'s former use as a deadly neurotoxin (a nerve agent in warfare). Oh and did you hear the one about the study that showed possible links between sweeteners and cancer? Yeah, well, that was back in the 1970s, and it was only found in lab rats, so how reliable is that anyway?- Other than that, the line is: We don\\\\\\'t talk about stuff we don\\\\\\'t do. We\\\\\\'re all natural.- And I did indeed come across two companies who profess to add no extra sugar. One was Natural Foods, who rely on sugars already in fruits like dates.-  Natural Foods with \"no added nonsense.\" That\\\\\\'s no extra natural sugar or artificial sweeteners to you and me \"It\\\\\\'s okay to get a bit of sugar on a daily basis, but there is so much added sugar, so we don\\\\\\'t add anything else,\" said Joost Warbout of Natural Foods. \"There\\\\\\'s a little bit [of sugar] from the fruit but that\\\\\\'s it.\" It\\\\\\'s a simple concept. If you pick up one of their fruit bars, the ingredients will read 51 percent cashews and 49 percent dates. Equals 100 percent. So it is possible. \"It\\\\\\'s cold pressed and because of the fruit it sticks together and because of the nuts it has bite, so we don\\\\\\'t have to bake it,\" said Warbout. Then there\\\\\\'s Germany\\\\\\'s old, establishment baker, Brandt. They also have a sugar-free product, but some sugar arises naturally through the baking process. Sometimes, just sometimes, \"sugar free\" actually means sugar free (although some sugar may arise through baking) The thing is, sugar-free for Brandt means \"not sweet.\" Shtum unless it\\\\\\'s Stevia- - But we do still like to eat sweet things. And why not? Live a little. Some will even say our desire for sweet tastes is genetic. Zucceroo makes decorative sugar products for things like cakes. They only use real sugar. \"The original sugar from sugar beet, or cane sugar, is what we all know and love. I\\\\\\'d say that is genetic,\" said Zucceroo\\\\\\'s Peter Forsch. \"Technical sugars like Stevia and Isomalt may have a place in drinks, but we don\\\\\\'t love them in food.\" - Zucceroo\\\\\\'s Peter Forsch says our desire for sweet things like sugar - real sugar - is \"genetic\" Stevia is the only artificial sweetener manufacturers seem comfortable talking about. Perhaps that\\\\\\'s because it\\\\\\'s plant-based, and it\\\\\\'s kind of a trendy super-additive at the moment. It\\\\\\'s a low-calorie sweetener and grows like herbs. Just ask the Swiss cough sweet-maker, Ricola.- \"We use Stevia because it\\\\\\'s a natural alternative that fits well together with bee balm. Stevia tends to have a taste on its own, so it doesn\\\\\\'t go with every product,\" said Ricola\\\\\\'s Luka Eiselin. \"But we use Stevia to be as natural as possible.\" The Coca-Cola company has apparently found Stevia\\\\\\'s natural taste an issue. The soda giant had to remodel its \"Coke Zero\" recipe a few times. I chewed on a Stevia leave at the ISM and it tastes a bit herby, minty and sweet. - \"We use alternative sugars because of the calories in natural sugar and the risk of diabetes, but also because sugar is bad for your teeth,\" said Eiselin.- Sour side-effects But artificial sweeteners have their own bad side-effects. \"Stevia is not much different from an artificial sweetener in my opinion,\" said Ulf Herrmann of Frusano. \"It has a bitter aftertaste and I simply don\\\\\\'t like it.\"- Frusano makes sweets suitable for people with a fructose intolerance, a dangerous condition. They use glucose syrup. Frusano\\\\\\'s Ulf Herrmann: Sugar alternatives are not always about lower calories, but countering a fructose intolerance \"Most producers who use artificial sweeteners use a mixture. Even if you use Stevia, usually there are also sugar alcohols like Sorbitol to mask the taste and make the sweetness round,\" Herrmann said. \"It\\\\\\'s almost the opposite of clean labeling. You add more and more ingredients to mask the side-effects of the one, and then another to mask that.\"?Labeling is clearly an issue with sweeteners and more so, the extent to which we, the consumers, understand or even read it. For instance, did you know that some artificial sweeteners have a laxative effect? They can cause bloating and intestinal gas. \"There\\\\\\'s a new EU law that says you have to write that on packaging,\" said Herrmann. \"The wording is something like \\\\\\'If consumed in large quantities, may cause diarrhea.\\\\\\' But it always does [if you consume a lot]!\" First the sugars, then the gelatin! Katjes has kickstarted a new trend: vegetarian sweets avoid animal-based gelling agents - -One of my next stops at the ISM was Dallmann\\\\\\'s, a German company best known for its sage cough sweets. I asked what they used in their \"sugar-free\" product: real sugar or sweeteners? Ricola, I said, uses Stevia now. The dapper Dallmann\\\\\\'s salesman, Herr Lippmann, in his fake apothecary lab coat, looked confused. Then he told me Dallmann\\\\\\'s uses a mixture of Sucralose and Isomalt. But he seemed distracted, and mainly concerned with pointing me back to his competitor Ricola, whose website showed \"they also use Aspartame.\" - The fact is Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners like Acesulfame potassium, Sucralose, and sugar alcohols like Isomalt are approved for use in foods in the European Union and the United States, just to mention two major markets. But the complete list of substances approved for use in food varies from region to region. Aspartame, like many other types of artificial sweeteners, is hundreds of times more potent than natural sugar. So you should always check the label on \"sugar-free\" products and if you\\\\\\'re unsure what the E-numbers - like \"E 954\" (Saccharin) or \"E 951\" (Aspartame) - denote, dig deeper online. Also check recommendations for \"Acceptable Daily Intake\"-(ADI).- On my way out of the ISM I headed back to the Ricola stand to ask them about Aspartame. Eiselin had left, so I had the pleasure of meeting the company\\\\\\'s young head Felix Richterich. Only as soon as I mentioned Aspartame, he no longer wanted to talk and insisted I contact Eiselin. I have yet to hear back. Please note: This article was originally published on February 1, 2017. At the-time of publication, Ricola had yet to reply to our request for comment on its use of Aspartame. Since then we have received an email from Lukas Eiselin. Here is an unedited, relevant part of his response: \"When Ricola launched the first sugar free herb drops in the 80ies [sic] aspartame was the state-of-the-art sweetener for tooth-friendly and low-calorie sweets. Although certain studies do raise questions to its safety, independent organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) as well as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have tested the safety of aspartame and confirm that it is safe for consumption.\" -- These additional paragraphs were added to this article on February 3, 2017.\\'\\n \\'She might just be the proof-some women may need that turning 40 is nothing to dread. Since dropping her lastest single, \"Chantaje\" featuring Maluma, last November, the Colombian superstar has been challenging her fans to send in videos of their own dance moves as they shake their own hips to her track. (Shakira faithfully posts most tweets twice, in Spanish and English.) A quick scan of #ChantajeChallengeContest offers a few moments of what the Germans would call \"fremdsch?men\" (being embarrassed for someone else) - and proof that at 40 Shakira herself still has the world\\\\\\'s fastest, sexiest hips. While with her midriff tops, skimpy dresses and erotic moves and lyrics, she may not embody the emancipated modern woman - and certainly didn\\\\\\'t in 2001 when she stormed onto the US music scene with her steamy \"Laundry Service\" video and run-of-the-mill pop album of the same name. Not your typical pop queen She was already a big star in Latin America, but with her North American breakthrough at the beginning of the 2000s, \"some people associated the Colombian singer with her American pop-music contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera,\" wrote music magazine \"Rolling Stone.\" \"But the stylistic breadth of Shakira\\\\\\'s music - elements of folk, Middle Eastern and traditional Latin styles over a foundation of rock and pop - gave her a degree of credibility the American teen queens lacked.\" And perhaps that - besides her sheer vocal and dance talent - is what makes Shakira not only the inevitable superstar, but also all the more relevant in times of insular politics. So maybe we can\\\\\\'t dance like Shak (see #ChantajeChallengeContest). And maybe we can\\\\\\'t sing like Shak, a wunderkind who wrote her first song at age eight. But still, she could be any of us. Citizens of the world Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born in Barranquilla, Colombia, on February 2, 1977, as the youngest of eight siblings. Her Colombian-born mother had Spanish and Italian roots, while her father was born in New York to Lebanese immigrants. To create her signature dance style, the superstar is able to draw on her diverse cultural heritage - having tapped into her Lebanese background in particular to master the art of belly-dancing. The salsa beats in her 2006 megahit \"Hips Don\\\\\\'t Lie\" transported us to the palm-tree-lined squares of Havana, while \"Waka Waka\" made us all feel like Africans. Her 2010 single became the theme song of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the video has since racked up well over one billion views. As a UNICEF ambassador and founder of the Barefoot charity for kids in Colombia, Shakira\\\\\\'s activism has focused more on education than politics. But in times where national boundaries are being fiercely defended and cultural differences become points of contention, perhaps we are desperately in need of a beat that can break down barriers. Shakira\\\\\\'s Latin beats, spiced with Middle Eastern and other world elements and made comfortably familiar by being churned through the pop machine, make you feel like a citizen of the world - albeit one who traipses through the clubs of Miami, Barcelona, Cape Town or Havana, dressed in linen with cocktail in hand. -\\'\\n \\'Authorities will be able to force suspected Islamist extremists believed to pose a threat to the public to wear-electronic ankle bracelets, the German cabinet agreed on Wednesday. Previously, only convicted individuals could be required to wear the-device used to monitor-location and movements. With the cabinet proposal, \"Gef?hrder,\" or people who pose a security threat,-who have not been convicted can be forced to wear the device by order of the-Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). The change to the law was approved by the cabinet as part of a package of amendments to BKA law. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and Justice Minister Heiko Maas had previously agreed to change the law in the wake of the December 19 terror attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which killed 12 people and wounded nearly 50 others. The attacker, Anis Amri, was considered a potential threat to public safety and under surveillance until a few months before the attack-when he fell off the radar.- He was ordered to be deported to his native Tunisia, but the deportation was postponed because Tunisia delayed providing his papers. Despite the deportation order, he was able to move around Germany.- The incident prompted sharp criticism of measures aimed at preventing terrorism.-In response, the-German government has put forward-a host of measures to overcome apparent security gaps.

He affectionately calls it \"the baby.\" The animal is only two days old and-its birth was a relief for Ali\\\\\\'s family.-Here, in Iraq\\\\\\'s Mesopotamian Marshes, buffaloes are often the only capital and wealth. A year ago, Ali\\\\\\'s family lost half its buffaloes to-a severe drought. Most inhabitants of the marshes were similarly affected.- The-wetlands,-which some describe as the cradle of civilization, are located in southern Iraq, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet and divide into dozens of channels before flowing-into the Persian Gulf. They are an oasis in the middle of the desert - a biodiverse-Garden of Eden - and home to the \"Marsh Arabs,\" whose unique culture is perfectedly adapted to their environment. Or at least, they used to be, before Saddam Hussein drained them in early 1990s to punish tribesmen there who backed a Shiite uprising against the Baath regime. That paradise, which once encompassed over 20,000 square kilometers, became a hell: a desert filled with mines. The rich wildlife disappeared and locals were forced to leave. Reviving Eden In total, half a million people were displaced as a result of what the United Nations in 2001 called a \"major ecological disaster, broadly comparable in extent and rapidity to the drying of the Aral Sea.\" In 2003, when Saddam Hussein\\\\\\'s regime fell following the US-led invasion of Iraq, the Marsh Arabs-returned home-and destroyed the dikes that blocked the rivers. \"There was no plan to restore the marshes,\" recalls local engineer Jasim al-Asadi, who was among the first to hack into the embankments built by Saddam Hussein. \"The locals took the initiative because this marsh is their life.\" Soon, water flowed back into the marshes. This could have marked a rare-happy ending for post-invasion-Iraq. But today, the marshes are again at risk and some fear they-could disappear-for good. The marshes are only half their former size and pick-ups now drive where once there was water Too salty for life \"There is a big problem with the water, both in terms of quantity and quality,\" explains al-Asadi, who is also the local managing director of Nature Iraq, a nongovernmental organization working on the marshes. Climate change,-poor usage and distribution of water in Iraq,-and above all dams upriver, have dramatically reduced the volume of water flowing into the wetlands. The marshes are about half the size-they used to be. And the water is too salty. With reduced water flow, rising temperatures and evaporation, as well as-saltwater intrusion from the Gulf, salinity levels have rocketed. \"Before Saddam drained the marshes, the salinity level wasn\\\\\\'t more than 200 ppm [parts per million],\" says al-Asadi, who remembers how the Marsh Arabs used to drink it. Average salinity is currently around 2,500 ppm. But it sometimes reaches 7,000 ppm - and in 2015 it reached 20,000 ppm in some parts of the marshes. \"The buffaloes would drink the water and die. They would poison themselves,\" remembers Sayeed Ali Murad, 29, a buffalo breeder living deep in the marshes. \"The reeds died, all the plants died.\" He lost more than 15 animals. Water as a weapon Iraq\\\\\\'s political and security situation has only made things worse since the-\"Islamic State\" (IS) organization took control of dams on the Euphrates in Ramadi and Fallujah. In June 2015, IS-closed the Ramadi dam gates, lowering the river\\\\\\'s-water levels. IS has lost control of Ramadi and Fallujah-but still holds Syria\\\\\\'s largest dam, the Tabqa dam on the Euphrates. All this makes survival in the wetlands harder. But so far,-Sayeed Ali stays. \"We are so happy here in nature.\" Just now, the situation is better, he explains. \"The water is okay at the moment,-but in a few months we will probably suffer from the lack of it.\" If the water decreases again, he admits he will probably have to leave. Sayeed Ali Murad says if things get any worse he will have to leave Indeed, a new threat is emerging, this time from Turkey. The Ilisu Dam, a contentious hydroelectric dam on the Tigris River, could start operation by the end of 2017, and would further reduce the water flow. \"Turkey, Syria and Iraq have agreements for sharing water resources - but Turkey doesn\\\\\\'t respect them,\" says al-Asadi. Ankara\\\\\\'s control of the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers has long been criticized in the Middle East, with some blaming Turkish-water policy on shortages that have fed conflict and instability-in Syria and Iraq. Who cares about a marsh? In today\\\\\\'s chaotic Iraq --with its internal political crisis and rampant corruption - saving the natural wonder of the-Mesopotamian Marshes just isn\\\\\\'t high on the national agenda.- The country allocates most of its water to wasteful intensive irrigation practices, prioritizing agriculture over conservation. In July 2016, the Mesopotamian Marshes were added to Unesco\\\\\\'s World Heritage list as a \"refuge of biodiversity.\" Many Marsh Arabs doubt the impact of this-gesture. But-activist Toon Bijnens thinks it is \"more than symbolic.\" A member of the Iraqi Civil Society Solidarity Initiative, Bijnens says the inclusion of the marshes in the list \"sets priorities straight\" and could push Iraqi authorities to take action to protect the marshes. \"Now that the marshes are world heritage, the Iraqi government will have to develop a comprehensive water distribution plan which takes into account not only agricultural production, but also sustainability of the marshes.\"\\'\\n \\'In a statement issued on Tuesday, the two companies announced their tie-up, saying that Daimler planned to \"introduce self-driving vehicles on Uber\\\\\\'s global ridesharing network in the coming years.\" The statement, however, didn\\\\\\'t reveal any financial details of the cooperation. Daimler chief executive (CEO) Dieter Zetsche said that the \"inventor of the automobile\" would aim to become a leader in autonomous driving, which was \"one of the most fascinating aspects of reinventing mobility.\" San Francisco-based Uber has invested heavily in self-driving car technology in recent years and is currently piloting the use of autonomous vehicles in the US city of Pittsburgh. But it had no car-building experience, CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick admitted, which was why he was \"opening up the Uber platform\" to automakers like Daimler. \"Self-driving technology holds the promise of creating cities that are safer, cleaner and more accessible. But we can\\\\\\'t get to that future alone,\" he said. Uber is already working with Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021. It has already built a self-driving truck which successfully delivered a beer shipment in October.

US car giant General Motors (GM) last year announced a $500-million (460-million-euro) investment in Uber\\\\\\'s rival Lyft, while Google parent company Alphabet has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to develop self-driving cars. The BMW group, which has partnered with US computer chip giant Intel, said earlier this month it plans to start testing self-driving vehicles on roads in the US and Europe by the end of the year. uhe/hch (AFP, dpa) -\\'\\n \\'The former head of President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it is only a matter of time before the president pulls America out of the Paris climate agreement, and that an executive order on the issue could come within days. Myron Ebell said President Trump was determined to undo policies implemented by Barack Obama to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \"I expect Donald Trump to be very assiduous in keeping his promises, despite all of the flack he is going to get from his opponents,\" he told the media at a briefing in London on Monday. He was speaking at an event organized by The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the main group advocating climate change skepticism in the United Kingdom. Speaking in London, Ebell also called the environmental movement \"the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world.\" Ebell, a long-standing climate change denier, said the United States would \"clearly change its course on climate policy\" under the new administration. \\\\\\'Multiple ways\\\\\\' to pull out Ebell worked for Trump until his inauguration on January 20. He sees himself as an \"enemy of climate change alarmism,\" and does not accept that carbon dioxide is affecting the Earth\\\\\\'s climate. He told the gathering the president could pull the US out of the Paris Agreement at short notice: \"He could do it by executive order tomorrow, or he could wait and do it as part of a larger package. There are multiple ways and I have no idea of the timing,\" Ebell said. Wednesday (01.02.2017) sees the confirmation hearing of President Trump\\\\\\'s nominee to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Critics are concerned because Pruitt also denies climate change, and has engaged in major lawsuits against anti-pollution regulations governed by the EPA. This includes the Clean Power Plan, which was the key element of the Obama administration\\\\\\'s emissions reduction program. The clean power plan aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants Fossil fuel chief as climate negotiator? Rex Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief executive, nominated by Trump as Secretary of State, indicated during his recent Senate hearing that the US might remain in global climate negotiations, which are being coordinated by the United Nations. In response to a question about the Paris Agreement, he said: \"I think it\\\\\\'s 190 countries have signed on. We\\\\\\'re better served by being at that table than by leaving that table.\" Yet apart from indicating it might be better to stay in the negotiations, Tillerson played down climate change considerably. Christina Deconcini, Director of Government Affairs at the World Resources Institute, told DW: \"He misstated and understated the scientific evidence around climate change and what is happening.\" ExxonMobil is accused of having covered up evidence of climate change in its own research for decades. As climate deniers are poised to serve in prominent positions of Trump\\\\\\'s administration, environmentalists have taken to the streets amid worries they could roll back environmental protections. Trump himself, who initially called climate change a \"hoax,\" eventually conceded \"some connectivity\" between humans and climate change, and has now said he is keeping an \"open mind\" on the issue. Pruitt is poised to become the head of the Environmental Protection Agency - an agency he repeatedly sued since becoming Oklahoma Attorney General in 2011. He opposes the Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing carbon emissions. He has also blocked implementation of the Clean Water Rule, which expanded protection for bodies of water and requires polluters to clean up wastewater. Secretary of State nominee Tillerson worked for petroleum giant ExxonMobil for more than 40 years. During his confirmation hearing, when pressed, he acknowledged climate change risks. He said the increase in greenhouse gases is \"having an effect,\" but added \"our ability to predict that effect is very limited.\" ExxonMobil is accused of covering up climate research over several decades. Environmentalists are concerned that as Secretary of Energy, the former Texas governor will boost oil and gas rather than focusing on renewables. In the past, Perry said he intended to axe the whole energy department. He has called global warming a \"contrived phony mess.\" He\\\\\\'s likely to support the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. However, Texas did increase wind power production under Perry. Zinke, an ex-Navy SEAL commander from Montana, keeps changing his position on climate change. Initially in favor of climate protection, he later denied it even exists. At his confirmation hearing he told Senate, \"I don\\\\\\'t believe it\\\\\\'s a hoax.\" As head of the Interior Department, he would oversee about a fifth of all US land - and make decisions about coal mining, and drilling for oil and gas. Author: Sarah Steffen From rhetoric to action Ebell told the press in London he assumed the president would overrule Tillerson on any dispute over climate policy. However, President Trump\\\\\\'s recent assertion that he would give his secretary of defense, James Mattis, the final say in a dispute over policy on torture could indicate that he may allow his cabinet to make decisions that are not necessarily in line with his own rhetoric. President Trump has already removed the climate change page from the White House website, revived two controversial oil pipelines and put communications restrictions on the EPA and the National Parks Service. Although he appears to have moved slightly away from his campaign stance by admitting there is \"some connectivity\" between human activity and climate change, he has also stated that he will not allow environmental or climate regulations to make US companies uncompetitive. \"There are reasons to think some of the rhetoric might be toned down and different decisions made along the road,\" WRI\\\\\\'s Deconcini told DW. She says Trump may realize that it is \"in America\\\\\\'s best interests\" to remain in the Paris Agreement after all. Climate goals still in sight Even if the new administration does roll back the Clean Power Plan, Deconcini saysother developments could mean the US could still achieve its climate targets of reducing 2005 emission levels 26 to 28 percent by 2025. \"It\\\\\\'s quite conceivable that under a new administration, the states would really up their game,\" Deconcini said. She also pointed out the tremendous speed with which renewable energy is advancing, and how fast the price of it is coming down. Renewable energy has taken on its own momentum, and is now among the cheapest forms of energy to develop \"So it\\\\\\'s possible through market forces, and good state actions and businesses - who are not going to stop moving in low-carbon directions - that we will be able to meet those targets.\" Deconcini said she hoped the President\\\\\\'s background as a businessman would convince him that if the US is to be competitive, it must not \"cede the ground on the clean energy race to other countries.\" Convinced of-climate impacts She told DW opinion polls showed people in the US are extremely interested in moving to a low-carbon economy: \"Many polls demonstrate it\\\\\\'s not the top concern of people in the US; but people generally want policymakers to move in that direction.\" The WRI believes as climate impacts become increasingly evident and costly, the pressure to combat climate change will increase. Deconcini cites concern over the likely impact of sea level rise in Florida as one example. \"I think that will increase the urgency over time, and the amount that elected representatives hear from their constituents about wanting to move towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\" Myron Ebell, however, remains convinced that President Trump \"thinks global warming is not a crisis and does not require drastic and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\" At one point considered to be a pick for heading the EPA, Ebell has now returned to his position as Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy at the Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.\\'\\n \\'By Patrick Wood By its very nature, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit organization exclusively run by Technocrats.

But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body, preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through, has proved effective in trials using monkeys. The researchers behind the product, known as Vasalgel, hope it could get trials in humans within a few years. \"What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans,\" said Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials. A new study, published Tuesday, involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females. Any adverse effects, as well as their ability to impregnate females, was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies. \"It was a simple efficacy study,\" Lissner said, meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy. The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season, and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time. One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly, and another developed a sperm granuloma, or lump of sperm, but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation, Lissner said, adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy. Lissner\\\\\\'s team is hoping to conduct clinical trials in humans next year and plans to stage further animal trials this year in preparation. But although the gel worked well in monkeys, it won\\\\\\'t necessarily translate perfectly to humans. \"This is a bigger, longer task than we first anticipated,\" Lissner said. Stopping sperm in their tracks Administering Vasalgel inside a man, or a monkey, involves a polymer injected into the sperm-carrying tubes between the testicles and penis, known as the vas deferens, to block sperm as they are released. The injection is given under anesthetic and mimics the effect of a vasectomy, but without the snip. \"It\\\\\\'s a sticky gel that goes into (the tubes) and basically filters out sperm,\" Lissner said. A similar polymer called RISUG is being trialled in India and has proved effective in men. The new gel is injected in a location similar to that cut during a vasectomy and allows fluids through while blocking sperm. The backed-up sperm are then reabsorbed by the body. A further benefit is that -- unlike with a vasectomy -- the gel is meant to disintegrate when a second solution is injected to break down the barrier and flush it out. This would make the process reversible. Reversibility was shown in trials on rabbits, but it was not tested in the new trial on monkeys. Recent trials on baboons also failed to reverse the effect. \"Successful reversibility will be the key to make this world-changing,\" Lissner said. Invasive procedure A further factor likely to impact numbers using this method is that Vasalgel still involves minor surgery to pull out the sperm tubes and inject the gel. What\\\\\\'s more, when sperm are reabsorbed into the body, there is a risk of an immune reaction, potentially leaving men less fertile after reversal -- similar to vasectomy, though risks with the gel are lower, according to Lissner. \"Fifty percent of men after a vasectomy reversal remain infertile,\" said Dr. Ilpo Huhtaniemi, emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the new study. However, he points out that this doesn\\\\\\'t prevent men from having children, as sperm can still be collected and used for in-vitro fertilization. The latest evidence on monkeys has many hoping a new form of contraceptive may be on the horizon, but experts believe more evidence is first needed on its reversibility. \"In order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible, and it\\\\\\'s reassuring that apparently such studies are ongoing,\" said Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who was also not involved in the new research. \"The idea of trying to replace the traditional method of vasectomy by inserting a gel into the tube which carries sperm from the testicles to the penis at ejaculation is not a new one. However, we haven\\\\\\'t seen much progress in developing the idea in recent years, so this study is a useful step in the right direction.\" A male hormonal birth control injection was shown to prevent pregnancy in a 2016 study but was ended early due to side effects. Other approaches have involved strategies to control the production of sperm by targeting the hormone testosterone, but this had side effects of depression and weight gain. In 2015, Japanese scientists discovered a protein, calcineurin, found to be crucial in helping sperm swim and break through the membrane of a female egg in order to fertilize it. When the genes behind this protein were blocked during studies in mice, they became infertile. But Vasalgel is further along than the Japanese research and has not shown severe side effects in animals. Lissner is confident that her team\\\\\\'s gel will overcome the challenges. She sees value in providing birth control that does not interfere with hormones. \"Why manipulate the whole body when there\\\\\\'s a small tube that all the sperm swim through?\" she asked. Huhtaniemi agrees that Vasalgel could be valuable in certain populations but feels that in terms of birth control for the masses, a less-invasive option is needed. \"We need a pill. That\\\\\\'s the easiest to administer,\" he said. \"It is feasible. We just need to find the right target.\"\\'\\n \\'Two tragic cases in Europe have raised awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. Over the weekend, six teenagers died in the southern-German town of Arnstein after they had spent the night in a garden shed with a defective wood-fired heater. And last week,-three migrants had died in a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos-because they were using makeshift stoves in tents, according to news agency AFP.- Carbon monoxide poisoning is associated with a dangerous collection of symptoms - lightheadedness, confusion, headaches and dizziness can all occur from mild acute poisoning, Greater exposure can result in-toxic levels in the heart and central nervous system, which ultimately leads to death. Although the gas is extremely toxic it is completely odorless, tasteless, colorless and non-irritating, making it extremely difficult to detect,-or for someone to notice that they\\\\\\'re breathing it in.- After someone breaths in carbon monoxide it enters the bloodstream, where it then bonds with the haemoglobin in the blood stream to form carboxyhaemoglobin. As carbon monoxide molecules-has a stronger affinity to-haemoglobin than oxygen, the oxygen get \"crowded out.\" There\\\\\\'s essentially no space left for it on board-the red blood cells.-It means the-oxygen can\\\\\\'t be carried in the blood,-which ultimately leads to the death and failure of other cells and tissues-in the body. Carbon monoxide is primarily released in to the air when fuels such as gas, oil and coal don\\\\\\'t burn completely. Poorly installed or badly-maintained boilers, gas fires, water heaters or cookers are common sources of accidental leaks of the dangerous gas. How do you cure a poisoned patient? The initial treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is oxygen therapy in a hospital. This involves asking the patient to breath in 100 percent oxygen to allow-the-body to gradually replace the carboxyhaemoglobin. Since normal air contains around 21 percent oxygen, it means the body can flush out the toxic chemicals. Therapy usually continues until the levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in the bloodstream is less than 10 percent.- In some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used. This process floods the body with oxygen in a pressurized room or tube and can be used if the patient has been under exposure to carbon monoxide for a long period of time or is suspected of having nerve damage.- Recovery- If a patient avoids critical damage from poisoning they can often recover, with the time dependent on how much of the gas was in the body.-However there are often long-term complications after treatment. These can involve breathlessness, chest pains, seizures and often loss of consciousness. As well as brain damage in the-form of vision loss, hearing loss or even the development of Parkinson\\\\\\'s disease. Over exposure can also effect the heart, with many survivors developing coronary heart disease, which can lead to heart attacks.- According to the British National Health Service-10-15 percent of survivors tend to develop some form of long-term effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.-\\'\\n \\'The active service life of a disposable coffee-to-go cup is about 15 minutes. Once it\\\\\\'s over, it gets chucked into a dustbin, or onto the street or into some bushes. This daily phenomenon plagues cities everywhere. It entails significant on-going clean-up costs, and it\\\\\\'s an eyesore. Disposable plastic cups are an extra-big problem - their remains can-last indefinitely in the environment. According to data from Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a German environmental organisation, almost three billion cups land in the trash in this country-every year. On average, each of Germany\\\\\\'s 82 million people uses 37 cups a year, and the production of plastic cups or plastic-sheathed paper cups causes CO2 emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes per year in Germany. Trend toward reusable cups? Public discomfort about disposable cups is increasing. Consumers, caf¨¦ operators and cities are looking for solutions.- People often bring their personal cups along on the morning commute to work. More and more canteens, bakeries and caf¨¦s are now offering reusable cups as an alternative to disposables. Overflowing rubbish bins like this one, photographed in January 2015 in Berlin, are an all-too-common sight The city of Berlin is now preparing to attempt a great leap forward: soon, coffee consumers in Berlin will be able to enjoy their coffee-to-go from a refillable cup supplied by coffee retailers. You have to pay pay-a deposit, which will be quickly and easily refundable when the cups are returned to participating retailers. The Berlin administration\\\\\\'s proposal for the introduction of a multi-use returnable cup system is now being discussed by its Environment Committee. The initiative is scheduled to be voted on within the next few weeks by the city\\\\\\'s municipal parliament. \"We see a clear trend in the direction of reusable cups, starting with small initiatives in cafes, projects at German universities or with the Berlin S-Bahn. The decision by the city\\\\\\'s politicians paves the way for a multi-reuse future,\" said Stefanie Otterstein of DUH. About 3.8 million disposable paper or plastic cups are thrown away in Germany each day - more than a few of them become litter Cheaper for both consumers and retailers Every year around 2,400 tonnes of coffee-to-go cups are produced in Berlin. Berlin\\\\\\'s policy initiative aims to support a shift from disposable to reusable cups with incentives: a-discount of at least 20 cents on the retail price of a cup of coffee, for consumers who use reusable rather than disposable cups. If it succeeds, the measure will have a double benefit: it\\\\\\'ll be better for the environment, and it will save the government money on cleanup costs for parks and public places. It\\\\\\'s an echo of the deposit system on many glass and plastic bottles that has been in place in Germany for many years. Feel-good coffee-to-go A pilot project in Berlin called \\\\\\'Just swap it\\\\\\' has already generated encouraging early results. The initiative\\\\\\'s organizers developed a reusable mug made of bamboo, cornstarch, and synthetic resin, which is lent to customers in participating Berlin caf¨¦s for a 4 euro ($4.32) deposit. The customers can take the cup with them, and give it back at other cafes. Freiburg has its own reusable, refundable coffee cups (on the left) \"The mugs are catching on,\" project manager Ulrike Gottsauk told Deutsche Welle. \"Our goal is responsible consumption with a good feeling. We don\\\\\\'t want to point our fingers at consumers and induce a guilty conscience.\" According to Gottschau\\\\\\'s data, reusable cups and the deposit system also make financial sense for caf¨¦s: a-plastic cup including lid costs coffee sellers about seven cents, whereas the cost of washing reusable cups is less than half that amount. Incentive for environmentally friendly consumption Other German cities want to promote the use of reusable cups too. In Freiburg\\\\\\'s city center, the reusable \"FreiburgCup\"-has been available in caf¨¦s and bakeries since last November. Freiburg was-the first city in Germany with a multiple-reuse cup deposit system. \"We want people-to produce less waste and throw fewer coffee cups onto the streets,\" says Gerda Stuchlik, Freiburg\\\\\\'s mayor. The city\\\\\\'s quarter of a million residents currently go through about twelve million disposable cups annually.\\'\\n \\'A balanced diet with all the right nutrients isn\\\\\\'t important only for humans. It\\\\\\'s important for wild animals, too. Its absence can lead to rather horrifying consequences - as the example of wild hamsters living in western European farmlands demonstrates. The numbers of wild European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) have declined by more than 99 percent-over recent decades in Belgium, the Netherlands and the adjacent German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia during recent decades. It was already known that ploughing of fields, which destroys their underground burrows, was part of the reason, and pesticide exposure probably another. But a group of researchers led by Mathilde Tissier, a biologist at the University of Strasbourg in northeastern France, wondered if a nutrional imbalance might be part of the reason for the steep-decline too. Life in the maize fields Tissier and her colleagues knew that there\\\\\\'s little other than maize available for wild hamsters to eat in the industrial maize-field monocultures that have replaced natural ecosystems over huge swathes of Europe, to produce raw materials for biofuels as well as fodder for pigs or humans. Maize - usually called corn-in the United States and Canada-- is a grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. It is-descended from a genus of plants in the grass family called Zea-by scientists, or \"teosinte\"-in native Mesoamerican languages. Num, num. A balanced diet is important - not just for humans... The Strasbourg researchers knew that a nutritional deficiency caused by a diet too dominated by maize had caused health problems in human populations in the past. From 1735 to 1940, maize-based diets led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people from pellagra, a complex disease caused by deficiencies of either tryptophan or vitamin B3, or both. Vitamin B3 is also known as-niacin,-and if you look closely at the list of ingredients on a box of processed cereals, you\\\\\\'re likely to find niacin has been added. That\\\\\\'s a direct consequence of the pellagra problems of the past. Symptoms of niacin deficiency Pellagra is associated in the medical literature with the \"three Ds\": Diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. Physiological symptoms included red skin lesions, hair loss, enlargement and inflammation of the tongue, poor coordination, peripheral nerve damage, and an enlarged, weakened heart. But pellagra also makes people crazy. Prior to developing full-on dementia, pellagra sufferers display mental symptoms including heightened aggression, irritability, restlessness, intolerance to sensory stimuli like bright lights or odors, insomnia, emotional instability, and mental confusion. Was the same phenomenon - pellagra, and its raft of symptoms - affecting wild European hamsters whose diet was too maize-dominated? Tissier decided to find out --by feeding groups of hamsters different diets in the laboratory. A late 19th century victim of pellagra disease in North Carolina, USA A first set of lab experiments with wild specimens compared wheat-based to maize-based diets, each with side dishes of clover or worms. There was virtually no difference in the number of pups born, or the basic nutritional value of the different menus. But when it came to survival rates, the difference was dramatic. About four-fifths of the pups born of mothers feasting on wheat-and-clover or wheat-and-worms diets were successfully weaned. In stark contrast, only five percent of the baby hamsters whose mothers ate maize instead of wheat lived to the end of the weaning period. What was most disturbing is how some of them died: Their mothers - or, in some cases, their siblings - ate them. \"Females stored their pups with their hoards of maize before eating them,\" the scientists reported. \"Pups were still alive at that time.\" The maize-fed mothers showed other signs of abnormality: they ran in circles, \"climbing and pounding their feeders,\" when scientists entered the room. They also had swollen and dark tongues, reminiscent of \\\\\\'black-tongue syndrome\\\\\\' in dogs whose diets are deficient in niacin. The maize-fed hamsters had-blood so thick it was difficult to draw for samples, and a variety of skin or hair abnormalities. Maize - tasty for humans, bad news for hamsters Hamster pellagra After the first round of experiments, it seemed likely to Tissier that the hamsters were indeed experiencing their species\\\\\\' version of pellagra. \"Improperly cooked maize-based diets have been associated with higher rates of homicide, suicide and cannibalism in humans,\" the researchers noted in their final report, drawing a clear parallel between cannabalistic hamsters and-the types of craziness observed in 19th century-humans afflicted-with pellagra. So they re-ran the same set of dietary experiments with new groups of hamsters, with one difference: in the second round of experiments, they added a group of hamsters whose maize-based diets had been supplemented with added niacin (vitamin B3). Sure enough, the niacin-enriched diet was enough to eliminate the horrific symptoms associated with the maize-based diet. None of the niacin-supplemented mothers ate their young. The dire consequences of a vitamin B3-deficient maize diet, the scientists concluded, stemmed from a change in the hamsters\\\\\\' nervous system that induced-dementia-like behaviours. A normal hamster mother checking on her pups in their underground burrow A wider problem? If humans, dogs, and hamsters are all at risk of forms of pellagra if they\\\\\\'re restricted to excessively maize-based diets, the scientists suggested, other species of wild animals beyond European hamsters - for example, other wild rodents - may also be at risk of pellagra-like diseases and population declines in territories dominated by maize monocultures. \"Knowing that [wild animal] species [that live in modern farmlands] already face many threats, and that most of them are in danger of extinction, it is urgent to restore a diverse range of plants in agriculture schemes,\" the researchers wrote in conclusion. Gerard Baumgart, President of the Research Centre for Environmental Protection in Alsace, is an expert on the European hamster. Speaking to AFP on Friday, he agreed with the Strasbourg researchers\\\\\\' recommendations. \"Our hamster habitat is collapsing,\" he said. \"Monoculture in agriculture is really bad for biodiversity... Now we need to take concrete action.\" Conservation schemes available to support the remaining populations include restoration of diverse natural habitats, captive breeding, and reintroductions.

Scientists on the island of Fiji have discovered a type of ant that plants, fertilizes and guards its own coffee crops. The industrious creatures have been perfecting their agricultural know-how for millions of years. (22.11.2016) Sex is a serious business for arachnids, and male spiders are often eaten by the female after mating. So spiders have had to develop strategies to help pass on their genes. The males have found a work-around. (21.09.2016) Before the birds and the bees, there was Fractofusus, a prehistoric creature that scientists think was the first organism to use complex methods to reproduce, rather than just asexually multiplying. (05.08.2015) Israeli scientists found that it\\\\\\'s possibly unique, with-crabs - also known as Lybia or pom-pom crabs - controlling the-reproductive activity of the anemone. The group were following up on a previous study that showed the crabs - unflatteringly classed-as \"kleptoparasites\" - regulate the food intake and, hence, the-growth of their \"guests.\" Scientists go-so far as to-liken-this to the careful-cultivation of bonsai.- Sea anemones throw out a protective shield around their crustacean host, which can save it from being gobbled up by a predator.- They also help the crabs-to pack a punch, having tentacles on their claws that are covered in stinging cells. This-helps-ward off predators, and-can-come-in handy in a duel. Crabs - which hold onto anemone with hooks - can also use them-as food mops, gathering debris from around their-home. While the anemone admittedly gets to feed off the scraps, it seems they benefit least from the relationship. After all, who wants to be a mere mop or pom-pom? Every crab has its mits full Researchers from Israel\\\\\\'s Bar-Ilan University and Volcani Center looked at the relationship a little more closely. Each-crab they had seen in the wild had two anemones. The team wanted to know how the crabs might come by their tentacled fighting tools in the wild. The crabs are tiny and hard to observe in the wild, so the scientists took a look at how they behaved in the laboratory. They found that when one sea anemone is taken from a crab, it will weave two smaller fragments from the remaining one. Over the next few days this then grows and regenerates. When a crab with no anemone is placed with a crab boasting the usual-two, the creature-without one will launch a brave assault on its tank-mate. Handled with care They\\\\\\'ll do so by holding down the claw of their opponent, and removing all or part of the anemone. Most such encounters would end with a successful theft, and the crabs would-grows whatever they were left with. \"Sea anemone splitting appears to be a well-orchestrated behavior, conducted with apparent care for the final outcome, ie, two new viable sea anemones,\" said the authors of the study, published in the open access journal PeerJ.- According to the researchers, it\\\\\\'s a unique example of one animal inducing the asexual reproduction of another. Perhaps that explains a little more of what\\\\\\'s in it for the anemone. It\\\\\\'s also what seems to happen in the wild. Using German DNA amplification techniques, the team-looked at genetic fingerprints from beaches near Eilat, on the Red Sea. Each crab was found holding genetically identical anenomes, indicating that they were originally one. In a previous study, the scientists found that the crabs, which themselves only grow to abount 2 centimeters (less than an inch),-appear to limit the amount of food that aneome get, limiting their size. Good things, as far as they\\\\\\'re concerned, come in small packages.-- -\\'\\n \"It Will Come for You All... page: 1 (For A little Halloween atmosphere, I present this...)

Rarely are they lauded for their role in bringing tequila shots and margaritas to the bars of the world. Yet without them, this beloved booze from Mexico might not exist. These flying mammals and the agave plant - from which tequila is derived - have co-evolved over millions of years. The lesser long-nosed bat, or tequila bat for short, flies under the cover of night to feed on the flowering desert plant. In exchange for its nectar, the bats scatter the agave\\\\\\'s seeds and pollen, allowing the spiky succulent plant to propagate and thrive in the wild.- With a range spreading across the American Southwest and much of Mexico, the bats are the primary pollinator of agave plants. But industrial farming practices in the tequila fields of Mexico disrupted that relationship many years ago, putting the tequila sector and the bats at risk.- The \\\\\\'Bat Man\\\\\\' of Mexico Tequila bats and agave plants have a mutually beneficial relationship In Mexico, around 138 species of bat are known to exist in addition to 180 species of agave plant. \"Mexico has more species of agave than any other country in the world,\" says, Rodrigo Medellin, a professor of vertebrate biology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Medellin, whose conservation work and lifelong interest in bats has earned him the moniker \"bat man,\" is concerned about the resilience of both agave and its pollinators.- As the source of tequila, blue agave is one of Mexico\\\\\\'s most commercially valuable crops. But during the 1990s, the monocropping of a single species of the plant led to disaster. A fungus chewed through row upon row of agave fields, extensively damaging the crop. Research suggests overproduction and poor land management practices were to blame. Medellin contends that the decline was also hastened by the loss of genetic diversity, thereby making the fields vulnerable to epidemics. \"They lose genetic diversity each time they plant with clonal shoots,\" he said. Today, the vast bulk of the tequila produced in Mexico is the byproduct of cultivars. That means the plants are carbon copies of each other, selected by growers for their quick growth rate and higher sugar content, rather than for their hardiness. Once they reach their peak, the entire agave crop is harvested before the plants have a chance to flower and go to seed. But in doing so, large-scale producers have removed a major food source from the bats\\\\\\' diet, while undermining the future of the tequila industry by not allowing for genetic diversity, Medellin explained. \"You need to allow a few plants to bloom,\" he said.- Two visions, one goal To bring bats back into the equation, conservationist Medellin has joined forces with restaurant and bar owner David Suro, who founded the Tequila Interchange Project in 2010 to market and promote sustainable agave spirits.- While Medellin has been championing conservation efforts in Mexico and abroad, David Suro has been tackling the problem from a different angle. He formed TIP with the goal of overhauling the dubious reputation tequila has had in the eyes of American consumers.- A small group of tequila growers in Mexico has agreed to make some of their crop bat friendly As the owner of a Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia, he knew his customers regarded tequila as the devil\\\\\\'s brew because they told him as much. To combat this bias, he sought out anthropologists and historians to better understand the role agave plants have played in Mexico\\\\\\'s history and culture. A product of the arid landscape, ample sunshine and mestizo society, \"tequila is very emblematic of Mexico,\" Suro said. Through his work, Suro eventually encountered Medellin. After bonding over a shared interest in bats and agave propagation, they came up with a model for producing bat friendly tequila. The project involves a simple shift in agricultural practices that benefits plant biodiversity and bats.- \"By allowing 5 percent of the agave plants to flower, about 225 plants per hectare, growers extend an invitation to those responsible for maintaining the genetic diversity of agaves: the bats!,\" according to TIP\\\\\\'s website. A small group of tequila producers in Jalisco, a Mexican state along the Pacific, agreed to join the pilot phase of the project, allowing a small percentage of their agave crop to go to seed in order to attract tequila bats. \"We are crossing our fingers that the bats will bring what is desperately needed, which is genetic strength from wild agaves into the tequila fields,\" Suro said. As of December 2016, the organization has produced 265,000 bottles of bat friendly tequila intended for sale and distribution in the US with more to follow. According to Suro, the second stage will involve working with artisans in southern Mexico, whose skill for producing agave-based spirits dates back to the Spanish colonial era. Changing minds with tequila- Bat friendly tequila could get people talking about the benefits of bats, say conservationists Rob Mies, founder of the Organization for Bat Conservation, believes TIP is off to a good start. \"Tequila opens up a door,\" he told DW. In short, the intoxicating allure of artisanal tequila made by skilled craftspeople is a good conversation starter for the role bats play as insectivores and pollinators in rural economies. It also helps that tequila has an outsized reputation for loosening tongues and opening minds, among aficionados. As the coordinator for research projects that monitor the migration of bats across the United States, Canada and Mexico, Mies believes the initiative has a built in market. Tequila already has legions of fans in America and abroad. US residents have a powerful Texas-sized thirst for tequila, consuming approximately 120 million liters, per year. Bat friendly tequila \"is a great way to tap into what people already enjoy, do and understand, and that\\\\\\'s margaritas,\" he said.\\'\\n \\'They tick all the boxes , flying under the radar and might be far more dangerous than anyone knows , just look who they do work for .

In the process, the germs, which usually cause stomach pain and diarrhea and in worse cases kidney failure, increased antibiotic resistance with each treatment. This was a mutation-the scientists expected. What they were not prepared for-was the observed speed with which the resistant germs multiplied after being treated. In one case the bacteria populations grew three times as big as in the case of normal E.coli bacteria within the same timeframe. Bacterial mutants are sustainable Even after removing the antibiotics, the mutated bacteria maintained its ability to multiply faster. \"Our research suggests, there could be added benefits for E.coli bacteria when they evolve resistance to clinical levels of antibiotics,\" lead author Prof. Robert Beardmore said. \"It is often said that Darwin evolution is slow, but nothing could be further from the truth, particularly when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics.\" He described the ability of bacteria to rearrange their DNA as \"remarkable.\" This could stop drugs from working sometimes in a matter of days. \"While rapid DNA change can be dangerous to a human cell, to a bacterium like E.coli it can have multiple benefits, provided they hit on the right changes.\"  In 2011 it became clear, how dangerous mutated forms of E.coli can be, when several people died of EHEC.  You may only know the Tasmanian devil as a cartoon character - the one that\\\\\\'s out to get the bird. But Australian scientists say the real thing may carry a deadly weapon against dangerous superbugs. (18.10.2016) With drug-resistant strains of bacteria jeopardizing the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and few new treatments on the horizon, scientists are looking to nature for answers. (29.11.2016) A strain of bacteria resistant to all known medications has been found in the US for the first time. Experts have long warned that overuse of antibiotics is creating drug-resistant bugs increasingly difficult to control. (27.05.2016) Asks Abdiel Reyes from Panama City (07.03.2016) Finding the source by DNA sequencing As part of the study, which was published on January 30th 2017 in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, the scientists exposed the bacteria to the antibiotic doxicycline. Then, they froze the bacteria at minus 80 degrees Celsius and conducted gene sequencing to find out exactly which genetic changes were responsible for the observed resistance. Some of the changes were well known and described in clinical patients. One of them is the ability of the bacteria to produce more \"antibiotic pumps\". These are segments called \"pump DNA\", which literally pump antibiotics out of the bacterial cell with the result of ensuring-that the drugs can not do their work. But the scientists also discovered that the mutated bacteria were lacking part of the DNA-that is known to describe a dormant virus. Several parallel evolutionary processes at work What that means exactly is not clear, but Dr. Carlos Reding - a co-author of the study - has an idea. \"Our best guess is that losing viral DNA stops the E.coli destroying itself, so we see more bacterial cells growing once the increase in pump DNA allows them to resist the antibiotic in the first place,\" Reding said. \"This creates an evolutionary force for change on two regions of the E.coli genome\". Usually, bacteria tend to use self destruction as a means to colonize surfaces. That\\\\\\'s how a biofilm develops - the slimy substance found,-for instance,-in the drains of sinks. \"But our study used liquid conditions, a bit like a bloodstream, so the-E.coli could give up its biofilm lifestyle in favor of increasing cell production\", the researcher suggests. Using antibiotics in a targeted way Dr. Mark Hewlett - also from Exeter University - added: \"It is said by some that drug resistance evolution doesn\\\\\\'t take place at a high dosage but our paper shows that it can and that bacteria can change in ways that would not be beneficial for the treatment of certain types of infection.\" Anyhow, he concludes, that it is important to use \"the right antibiotic on patients as soon as possible. So we don\\\\\\'t see adaptations like these in the clinic.\"\\'\\n \\'Earthworms, it seems, are the unsung heroes of our world. Labeled slimy and disgusting by many, these lowly invertebrates work unseen and underground where they till, fertilize and improve soil. But environmentalists are concerned that industrial agricultural practices are making life difficult for this surprisingly important animal. Intensive use of manure and acidic soil with a pH value below five harm the worm, although it remains unclear whether herbicides affect earthworm\\\\\\'s ability to reproduce. Still, one thing is for sure: the destruction of its habitat every few months with heavy machinery stresses the animal. Fewer than 30 earthworms are found per square meter on intensively farmed fields. But on organic farms, where the fields are rarely ploughed, up to 450 worms live in the same area, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). - That\\\\\\'s bad news according to agronomists and gardeners. A thriving earthworm population is an indication of healthy soil. And the retreat of the species is so evident-the WWF has published an \"Earthworm Manifesto\" to publicize the faith of these dirt-dwellers. - \"If earthworms suffer, so too does our soil and thereby the basis for agriculture and food supply,\" said Birgit Wilhelm, a WWF expert in the farming sector. For Wilhelm, these worms-are the least appreciated creatures on the planet. Diligent workers Earthworms are industrious and irreplaceable in that they tirelessly work to fertilize and aerate soil, and in the process help prevent soil erosion. \"Strictly speaking, there are 45 species and four categories [of worm] that carry out a range of tasks,\" explained Professor Heinz-Christian Fr¨¹nd, an environmental scientist with expertise in soil at the University of Osnabr¨¹ck. - A healthy soil full of earthworms can absorb up to 150 liters of water per hour Some eat fallen leaves and wood on the soil\\\\\\'s surface. Others gather en masse in compost heaps. A third category lives in mineral soil, which is derived from minerals or rocks and contains little humus or organic matter. The worms replenish the soil with their excrement, which contains all the nutrients plants needs to thrive, including nitrogen, phosphorous, and calcium. \"The most well-known species of worm, the common earthworm, plays a major role for the farming sector,\" said Fr¨¹nd. The animal builds a system of tunnels in which it lives. It digs a vertical main entrance from the top layers of the soil until it gets to a damp, reliable depth. In an enormous show of strength, the worm burrows through the earth, aerating it, so oxygen and plant roots can reach further down. This act contributes to soil formation and regeneration and improves its ability to absorb water. The common earthworm feasts on rotting, bacteria-rich plant matter that it finds on the soil\\\\\\'s surface. \"Therefore, it\\\\\\'s essential that farmers don\\\\\\'t harvest right down to soil level, but instead leave some remnants,\" Fr¨¹nd said. - Effects of climate change Droughts are particularly devastating for worm populations. If there are too few worms, the soil will become dense, poorly aerated and won\\\\\\'t absorb enough water. \"Soil that contains many earthworms will absorb up to 150 liters of water per hour and square meter,\" said WWF\\\\\\'s Wilhelm. \"If the soil has too few worms, it will act like a blocked drain. Very little will get through. That can lead to floods.\" The tiny earthworms carry out important tasks for our soils - but the tiny creatures have come under threat Heavy metals, such as copper, are one of the factors that can reduce earthworm numbers. However, copper compounds are used mainly by organic farmers - particularly in vineyards. Wine producers have been using the substance as a fungicide for about 100 years, although the European Union has designated it a \"candidate for substitution,\" compelling member states to seek more favorable alternatives. \"Large amounts of copper can negatively impact an earthworm\\\\\\'s enzymes. It inhibits their growth or they can no longer reproduce properly,\" according to Bernd Hommel, an expert in analysis and organic chemistry at the Julius-K¨¹hn-Institute, a federal research center for cultivated plants. Although the researcher also established that some earthworm species can excrete the absorbed metal. Even the agricultural sector has long known that earthworms need to be protected, says Hommel. \"Only synthetic pesticides that have been tested in the lab and out in the field for compatibility with earthworms are coming to market,\" he added. - Future food Still, the WWF warns of a \"dangerous chain reaction for humanity,\" and has called for politics and society to encourage an agricultural sector more focused on soil and humus-friendly farming. The goal of the EU\\\\\\'s farming policy should be the promotion and maintenance of natural soil fertility, said WWF\\\\\\'s Wilhelm. At a time when development is swallowing up more and more countryside, good soil is becoming increasingly important to ensure a secure food supply for the world\\\\\\'s growing population. Long-term soil fertility and the ability of farmland to recuperate are under threat and protecting earthworms with their ability to improve soil should be an agricultural goal. Research has shown there are solutions. \"Using a soil cover with a catch crop such as grass during winter led to a sharp rise in earthworms,\" Fr¨¹nd said. It\\\\\\'s a glimmer of hope for these underground dwellers. -\\'\\n \\'Ottmar Ilchmann is a 54-year-old dairy farmer from Germany\\\\\\'s East Frisia region. He has just 60 cows, and says it\\\\\\'s becoming harder and harder for small farms like his to survive. \"I see how many of my neighbors have to close their farms, and how much other farmers are taking the land from these little farms.\" By other farmers, Ilchmann means the big industrial agriculture operations that are swallowing up more and more of the German countryside. \"They are growing and growing,\" Ilchmann told DW. His neighbors aren\\\\\\'t alone in shutting down their operations. According to the Alternative Farmers Association, nearly 4,000 dairy farmers went out of business last year. And organizers of a recent protest in Berlin against the industrialization of agriculture say almost 100,000 small producers have been forced to close in the last decade. Much of the problem, you\\\\\\'ll hear farmers and experts explain, lies with discount pricing. The drive for cheap food means many producers can no longer sustain themselves. Farmers Arlette Seiler-Fuller and Luna Piyczyk protest in Berlin. The young couple say theirs is the greatest job in the world Policy for protest The \"We are fed up!\" demonstration has been happening annually since 2011. On January 21, 2017, around 18,000 people marched through the streets of the German capital to show their support for small farmers and wholesome food, chanting \"A future on the land!\" \"People are looking for other possibilities to make good farming which is good for the environment good for the animals and good for the people,\" said Ilchmann, who drove his tractor all the way from northwest Germany to take part. He wasn\\\\\\'t alone. In all, 130 tractors made the journey, according to the one of the event\\\\\\'s organizers, Iris Kiefer. One traveled almost 600 kilometers (373 miles). Arriving at the demonstration, these producers joined concerned consumers, along with organizations from slow food advocates to international development nonprofits. Taken together, they are people who value the work of small farmers\\\\\\', and share their ideals. Fighting free trade Like Stephanie Roth, who campaigns against the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Europe and Canada, which will be up for a vote in the European Parliament in February. \"We think it is really important to send personal messages to our elected deputies to tell them that we don\\\\\\'t want this free trade agreement,\" Roth told DW. Tractors pull away from Berlin\\\\\\'s Potsdamer Platz on as a part of the \"We are fed up!\" rally Roth argues that if Europe opens its market to foodstuffs produced more cheaply in North America, still more German farmers will be put out of business. The agreement would also allow genetically modified food into Europe. Recent studies indicate as many as 80 percent of Germans oppose this. \"There is a German saying that is very well known, every child knows it, it says: \\\\\\'Du bist was du isst\\\\\\' - you are what you eat.- And I think it is true,\" says Roth. Many in Europe see agreements that would harmonize conditions between Europe and North America as a threat. Karen Hansen-Kuhn works for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in the US. She says although small farmers are generally better off in Europe than they are in North America, things could shift. Public pressure \"What I hear from a lot of our EU partners is that we shouldn\\\\\\'t underestimate all of the pressure that is being put on EU policy makers to change,\" she told DW. This year\\\\\\'s demonstration put a special focus on helping young people to get into small-scale farming The risk is that if Europe were to step into line with countries like the United States, laws and subsidies could see small producers priced out of the market. But Hansen-Kuhn believes activists are making a difference. Food and farming have become an important public concern, and European lawmakers are having to listen to voters. \"You wouldn\\\\\\'t find the same thing in the US if you talked to a policymaker that they would be able to tick off, consistently, the same four sets of demands that they are hearing from local populations,\" she says. Part of that activism is about getting people out of the streets, as happened in Berlin last weekend. But Kiefer says the size of the crowd is less important than the dialogue between farmers, civil society and consumers. \"I think only if we go together, hand in hand, consumer and farmer, we can change our system-of food production.\"\\'\\n \\'Trump\\\\\\'s war on the environment has begun - and information is its first target. After ordering a contract freeze and media blackout-at the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday (24.01.2017), the administration on Wednesday went even further by mandating that any studies or data from the public agency undergo \"review\" by political appointees before being released to the public. The administration also reportedly instructed the EPA to remove the climate change page from its website, proving-citizen-driven efforts to collect and protect climate data-prophetic. The Department of Agriculture-also on Tuesday-issued an order banning scientists and other employees in its main research arm, the Agricultural Research Service, from publicly sharing results of its work. The Trump administration temporarily shut down the National Parks Service\\\\\\'s official Twitter account last Friday after it retweeted, among other things, a note that the new government-had removed references to climate change from the White House website. Specific offices of the National Parks Service, which is under the Department of Interior, were also targeted by the Trump administration after tweeting facts and information about climate change. While some tweets from the Badlands National Park account were deleted, rogue actions seem to be spreading to other park service accounts. Under a broad call to \"resist,\" National Parks Service employees have even set up an alternative Twitter account. Add to Trump\\\\\\'s acts of suppression sweeping executive orders, including to \"fast track\" development of controversial oil pipelines and build a border wall (which may never happen). Trump is also reportedly preparing an executive order to cut funding to the United Nations and review multilateral treaties including the Paris Agreement on climate change. Taken together, this paints a frighteningly undemocratic picture of unilateral control over public institutions. In fact, the picture it paints is reminiscent of another world power: China. From authoritarian to totalitarian Information is power - and the authoritarian-Chinese government is notorious for suppressing it. This applies to environmental matters as well. Recently, Chinese authorities told weather forecasters to stop issuing smog alerts. The Chinese government also ordered an app that collects air quality information to stop releasing data that exceeds official pollution caps. It\\\\\\'s trying to cover up how bad its air pollution problem really is. But China, at least, acknowledges the very real risks of climate change. The country is pledging to reduce emissions, and building out its renewable energy capacity. As climate deniers are poised to serve in prominent positions of Trump\\\\\\'s administration, environmentalists have taken to the streets amid worries they could roll back environmental protections. Trump himself, who initially called climate change a \"hoax,\" eventually conceded \"some connectivity\" between humans and climate change, and has now said he is keeping an \"open mind\" on the issue. Pruitt is poised to become the head of the Environmental Protection Agency - an agency he repeatedly sued since becoming Oklahoma Attorney General in 2011. He opposes the Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing carbon emissions. He has also blocked implementation of the Clean Water Rule, which expanded protection for bodies of water and requires polluters to clean up wastewater. Secretary of State nominee Tillerson worked for petroleum giant ExxonMobil for more than 40 years. During his confirmation hearing, when pressed, he acknowledged climate change risks. He said the increase in greenhouse gases is \"having an effect,\" but added \"our ability to predict that effect is very limited.\" ExxonMobil is accused of covering up climate research over several decades. Environmentalists are concerned that as Secretary of Energy, the former Texas governor will boost oil and gas rather than focusing on renewables. In the past, Perry said he intended to axe the whole energy department. He has called global warming a \"contrived phony mess.\" He\\\\\\'s likely to support the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. However, Texas did increase wind power production under Perry. Zinke, an ex-Navy SEAL commander from Montana, keeps changing his position on climate change. Initially in favor of climate protection, he later denied it even exists. At his confirmation hearing he told Senate, \"I don\\\\\\'t believe it\\\\\\'s a hoax.\" As head of the Interior Department, he would oversee about a fifth of all US land - and make decisions about coal mining, and drilling for oil and gas. Author: Sarah Steffen Therein lies an important difference: Trump\\\\\\'s America is all about handing out gifts to his fossil fuel cronies. On the same day he ordered the EPA media blackout, he sat down with beaming automobile executives to talk about how \"out of control\" environmental regulations are. Make no mistake: This is special-interest politics at its most extreme. United States environmental policy under Trump goes beyond China\\\\\\'s authoritarianism, since it doesn\\\\\\'t acknowledge - indeed, is trying to suppress - the basic fact that climate change exists. If China with its single-party system is authoritarian, Trump with his actions is totalitarian. Muzzling public agencies, strangling down their funding, removing their regulatory authority - will benefit only a few already wealthy businessmen. At the expense of the people. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior are taxpayer-funded institutions - therefore by the people, for the people. They exist to ensure clean air and clean water, and land use that manages wildlife and ecosystems in balance with human needs. Americans who support their right to clean air and clean water, and public lands managed in the public interest:-It\\\\\\'s time to stand up totalitarian policies. It is time to resist. Lest we allow special interests to complete their takeover of the US government.

Tuesday\\\\\\'s symbolic motion, which was proposed by the Scottish government led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, was backed by 90 votes to 34. It argued that the triggering of Article 50, which starts the two-year Brexit process, should be rejected because the UK government has left too many questions unanswered. OPINION: Scotland is trapped in a zombie union It said the Westminster parliament is not guaranteed a say in any new trade relationship once Britain has left the EU and the decision to proceed \"does not respect the majority vote to remain part of the EU that was returned in every council area in Scotland\". Scotland was told it would be an \"equal partner\" in the British union if it rejected independence, which it did by 55 percent in a 2014 referendum. In June 2016, Scotland voted to remain in the EU by 62 percent, but it was outvoted by England which has a vastly larger population. Brexit succeeded overall with 52 percent of the vote. Sturgeon has repeatedly demanded that the interests of Scottish people be taken into account during upcoming Brexit negotiations and says Scotland must have a choice on holding a new independence referendum if that is not the case. \"(This vote) is a key test of whether Scotland\\\\\\'s voice is being listened to and whether our wishes can be accommodated within the UK process,\" Sturgeon said ahead of the vote. OPINION: Nicola Sturgeon - The new champion of liberalism The Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland\\\\\\'s Place in Europe, Mike Russell, said the Scottish government will never allow Scotland to be humiliated and its democratic choice rejected. \"We will never, ever, turn our back on Europe and the world,\" he said. Russell said there was still time for London to avert another independence bid by Scotland if it accepted a \"compromise\" - a differentiated solution that would keep Scotland in the European single market even as the rest of Britain leaves. Britain\\\\\\'s highest court ruled last month that the launch of Brexit talks must be approved by the British parliament, but Prime Minister Theresa May has no legal obligation to consult the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amendments to May\\\\\\'s European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill currently making its way through the House of Commons, which would have given the regional governments a voice in the Brexit process, were rejected on Monday during a British parliamentary debate in London. Analysts say the Scottish parliament vote sends a clear signal to London that the Brexit process is proceeding without their support, but the UK government has no compulsion to listen. \"The UK government will continue our engagement with the Scottish government and with people and groups across Scotland as we prepare to leave the EU to secure the best deal for Scotland and the UK,\" a British government spokesman said.

The so-called \"Regulation Bill\"-instantly drew wide condemnation-as it was voted in by members of the Knesset late on Monday with a 60 to 52 majority. The law applies to about 4,000 settlement homes in the West Bank for which settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned Palestinian land and had received encouragement from the Israeli state to do so. Three Israeli NGOs - Peace Now, Yesh Din and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel - and numerous Palestinians said they intend to petition the Supreme Court to cancel the law.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday in a statement: \"This bill is in contravention of international law and will have far reaching legal consequences for Israel.\" The EU\\\\\\'s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that the bloc-\"condemns\" the law and urges against its implementation-\"to avoid measures that further raise tensions and endanger the prospects for a peaceful solution to the conflict\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the law was an aggression against the Palestinian people. \"That bill is contrary to international law,\" Abbas said following a meeting with French President Francois Hollande in Paris. \"This is an aggression against our people that we will be opposing in international organisations. \"What we want is peace ... but what Israel does is to work toward one state based on apartheid.\" Hollande called on Israel to go back on the law, saying it would \"pave the way for an annexation, de-facto, of the occupied territories, which would be contrary to the two-state solution\". Hours before Abbas\\\\\\' meeting with Hollande, Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, told the Associated Press news agency that the law puts \"the last nail in the coffin of the two-state solution\". Calling the move \"theft\", Erekat said the ruling showed \"the Israeli government trying to legalise looting Palestinian land\". AL JAZEERA\\\\\\'S SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, MARWAN BISHARA: \"What you have here is a crazy number of settlers in the [Knesset]. Ten percent of the Israeli parliament are settlers; indeed the speaker of the Israeli parliament is a settler. The settler lobby within the Israeli parliament is quite strong, even when they know that what they are doing is unconstitutional and will probably not pass the Supreme Court. The idea is that the government gets in on it ... even if they don\\\\\\'t get their way this time, they will be compensated if the Supreme Court rejects it. All in all, there isn\\\\\\'t much room for international pressure on Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows it, he knows he has a president in the White House who\\\\\\'s going to back him.- Israel is basically going on a spree to increase the settlements in the West Bank. At the end of the day, this is a moving, explosive situation that I cannot see in any shape or form in the intermediate run is simply going to go by without real, major repercussions in Palestine or outside.- Developing, over the last 50 years, is a dual system of government: one for the Jews in the West Bank and one for the Palestinians. There is only one name for that: apartheid. The Arab League also accused Israel of \"stealing the land\" from Palestinians. \"The law in question is only a cover for stealing the land and appropriating the property of Palestinians,\" said the head of the Cairo-based organisation, Ahmed Aboul Gheit. Palestinian owners will be compensated financially or with other land, but cannot negotiate their terms. The law is a continuation of \"Israeli policies aimed at eliminating any possibility of a two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state\", Aboul Gheit said. Jordan, one of the few Arab states to have diplomatic ties with Israel, also denounced what it called \"a provocative law likely to kill any hope of a two-state solution\". According to the UN envoy for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov,-the law crosses a \"very thick red line\" towards annexation of the occupied West Bank, and sets a \"very dangerous precedent\". Speaking to the AFP news agency, he said: \"This is the first time the Israeli Knesset legislates in the occupied Palestinian lands and particularly on property issues.\" He also raised the possibility the law could open Israel up to potential prosecution at the International Criminal Court, a threat Israel\\\\\\'s own top government lawyer, attorney general-Avichai Mandelblit,-has also warned of. Mladenov called for strong international condemnation of the legislation but declined to criticise the US after President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s administration refused to comment on it. READ MORE: Israeli settlement law \\\\\\'violates rights and dignity\\\\\\' Trump is more sympathetic to Israel\\\\\\'s settlement policies than previous US presidents; the Israeli government has approved plans to build thousands of new homes on occupied territory since the far-right leader settled into the White House. \"I think that is a very preliminary statement,\" Mladenov said. \"Obviously they do need to consult, this is a new administration that has just come into office and they should be given the time and the space to find their policies.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US was likely to discuss the law with Netanyahu when the Israeli prime minister visits on February 15, but did not comment further in a press briefing on Tuesday. David Harris, head of AJC, the global Jewish advocacy organisation, said that \"Israel\\\\\\'s High Court can and should reverse this misguided legislation\" ahead of Netanyahu\\\\\\'s meeting with Trump in February. That was also the message from Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who said last week: \"The chance that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court is 100 percent.\" International law considers all settlements to be illegal, but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not, dubbed outposts. A Palestinian Cabinet minister also called on the international community for support. \"Nobody can legalise the theft of the Palestinian lands. Building settlements is a crime, building settlements is against all international laws,\" said Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Minister Rula Maayaa. \"I think it is time now for the international community to act concretely to stop the Israelis from these crimes.\" Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the law \"unacceptable\" and urged the international community to act immediately. \"This is an escalation that would only lead to more instability and chaos,\" Rdeneh -said. Palestinians want the occupied West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip - territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war - for their future state.

Shortly before leaving office, US President Barack Obama allowed the UN Security Council to pass a resolution declaring settlements illegal. Tobias Ellwood, Britain\\\\\\'s Middle East minister, also condemned the land grab bill, saying it \"is of great concern that the bill paves the way for significant growth in settlements deep in the West Bank\". Yuval Shany, an-international law professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said the law violates basic rights, interferes with property rights and is discriminatory because it regulates only the transfer of land from Palestinians to Jews.

A meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Tuesday pushed back the refugees\\\\\\' legal right to stay from the previous deadline of March 31, state-run APP news agency-reported. There are currently about 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees resident in Pakistan, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Many fled violence in their country more than 30 years ago, during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, with others fleeing the US-led invasion in 2001. There are also about a million unregistered Afghan refugees present in the country, Pakistani officials say. A recent crackdown by Pakistani authorities, citing security concerns, has seen a sharp rise in both deportations and voluntary repatriations of Afghan nationals from the country. READ MORE: A hard winter - Afghan refugees return from Pakistan Last year, more than 600,000 Afghan refugees left Pakistan to return to their home countries, data from the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) shows. For registered refugees, that number represents a more than six-fold increase from the previous year, according to UNHCR. At least 22,559 Afghans were also deported by Pakistani authorities in that period, IOM says. Refugees and rights groups say increased harassment by police and stricter restrictions on crossing and returning from Pakistan\\\\\\'s northwestern border with Afghanistan have been responsible for the rising numbers.- The cabinet meeting on Tuesday reaffirmed those tighter controls on the border. \"It was also decided that the Afghans cross-border movement would now be regulated through the visa regime and their entry passes would be linked with it,\" reported APP. In November 2015, US-based rights group-Human Rights Watch documented a campaign of abuse and harassment of Afghan refugees by Pakistani police, involving confiscation of their registration cards, bribes and raids on their homes.

Source:-Al Jazeera News\\'\\n \\'On the afternoon of February 5-citizens in Bucharest marched simultaneously from several neighbourhoods across the city, converging on Piata Victoriei where the government building is located. The symbolism of this march was splendid: the grassroots coming together from the smallest corners to stand up to a central government perceived as abusive. For the past fortnight, hundreds of thousands have been demonstrating, first weekly, then daily, across all of Romania against two government proposals that would have seen those guilty of abuse in office pardoned or having their sentence reduced.  Then on the night of February 4, the Social-Democratic Party (PSD) which controls the government had announced tht it would withdraw the executive decree reducing some corruption sentences which had drawn the most public criticism. While people gathered in Piata Victoriei and elsewhere celebrated this victory, they also knew that the PSD would still try to push ahead with the measures. In the most likely scenario, the proposed legal changes will be put to vote in a parliament dominated by the PSD. The continuation of protests on February 5 despite the government\\\\\\'s announcement was meant to show the executive that it was being watched carefully. Protests may quiet down over the next days but they will most likely pick up once the laws get close to a parliamentary vote. The legal jargon around the two PSD legislative proposals was so complicated that even legal experts were struggling to figure out what was going on. But the nuances of the debate were not lost to protesters. As some in the crowd started asking for the resignation of the government, others immediately pointed out that the government had to stay until it withdrew the executive order and only then resign, otherwise the measures would have legal effect. This is evidence of the high level of sophistication among protesters, many of whom have participated in several waves of demonstrations in Romania since 2012 and become skillful at calling public institutions to account, communicating and organising. The strength of the protests of the past week cannot be understood without looking back at the past years of social mobilisation in Romania. This did not come out of the blue. Protest mobilisation coalesced for the first time during anti-austerity protests in 2012 but it became really powerful during 2013 when weekly protests were staged across the country to save the village of Rosia Montana from a cyanide-based gold mining project. It defeated the PSD government then, which emboldened it. Street protests stopped for a while but returned whenever there was something at stake: fighting deforestation, protecting green spaces in cities or changing electoral laws to make space for smaller parties and independents. New independent media and local activist groups were born. Mass demonstrations happened again after the Colectiv nightclub fire that killed 64 people in Bucharest in 2015. That tragedy revived investigative journalism that revealed criminal flaws in the functioning of the Romanian medical system. A few years ago, during one of the protests, an activist held a banner with the words \"A quarter of century of solitude\". Referring to the famous novel of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the protester, a historian and activist who had dedicated his adult life to mobilising young people towards civic involvement, was possibly reflecting on how daunting the task was. Like other post-communist countries, Romanian society was known for its low levels of civic involvement and solidarity. Fear of the Securitate - the secret police - during communism followed by the aggressive individualism of capitalism had left Romania\\\\\\'s social fabric in tatters. Those speaking about collective political action were seen as freaks. But within little more than five years this has changed. When the PSD unveiled the corruption laws, people knew what they had to do - get together in the streets and protest. It had become a familiar practice. Last week\\\\\\'s protests were the biggest since the fall of communism and participation was diverse, across age groups, economic class and political values. Moral outrage against a government ready to circumvent democratic process to serve its members\\\\\\' interests united people. At the same time small gestures of solidarity popped up such as restaurants offering free food and warm tea and hotels offering accommodation to those travelling to Bucharest to protest. Romania\\\\\\'s street protests will not solve the country\\\\\\'s problems. - A historical photograph from the bloody 1989 anti-communist revolution has been in circulation recently showing a young man holding a sign saying: \"We are here so that our children can be free\". It was echoed last week by young people, the children of the 1989 demonstrators, holding banners saying: \"We are still in the streets protesting\". The post-communist transition failed in many ways in Romania: primarily, because poverty levels are still staggering and the lives of working people still precarious. The PSD\\\\\\'s attack on democratic practices in order to pardon the corrupt indicated another failure: even the fundamentals of democracy have been under threat. But while a decade ago, Romanians would complain that they are a passive society not responding to abuse from the rich and powerful, today it is different. On February 4 in Bucharest, a children\\\\\\'s protest took place in Piata Victoriei, with families bringing their youngsters out on to the streets to teach them the value of civic involvement. The Romanian state is still failing most of its citizens, but something changed. Many are ready to do their it to help. Authoritarian regimes are rising everywhere in the world, not just in post-socialist Eastern Europe where democracies were always thought to be fragile. Last week, the-PSD gave a first sign that it was ready to sacrifice democratic processes for its own interests-and justify it with redistributive measures that are desperately needed. OPINION: Romania - Keep the corrupt in jail, where they belong The citizen response this past week has dealt a severe blow to the PSD. The party may have thought that winning elections by 45 percent allowed it to do whatever it wanted for the next four years, but protesters insisted the election result was not a blank cheque. Romania\\\\\\'s street protests will not solve the country\\\\\\'s problems. Failing public institutions, poverty and inequality, racism among others are very real problems that need to be addressed by wise policies and the political will to carry them through. If they are not dealt with, parties like the PSD will always try to exploit those failures for political benefit.-Romania desperately needs an alternative to the PSD on the left that could tackle these issues effectively. The demonstrations show that citizen power can check abuses by the powerful. In a world where our tolerance for such abuse seems to be increasing by the day, that\\\\\\'s an extraordinarily hopeful development. Claudia Ciobanu is a Romanian freelance reporter based in Warsaw.

One of the two investigating magistrates in charge of the case decided that it should go to trial,-a legal source told AFP news agency on Tuesday.  The prosecution claims Sarkozy spent nearly double the legal limit of $24m on his lavish campaign, using false billing from a public relations firm called Bygmalion. It is understood that 13 other individuals will also go on trial over the so-called \"Bygmalion Affair\".- Sarkozy\\\\\\'s lawyer announced plans to appeal the decision. Bygmalion charged $16.2m in campaign events to Sarkozy\\\\\\'s party - which at the time was called the UMP but has since been renamed the Republicans - instead of billing the president\\\\\\'s campaign. Sarkozy, who failed in a presidential comeback bid last year after losing to ex-Prime Minister Francois Fillon, has previously told investigators he knew nothing about the billing and put the responsibility squarely on Bygmalion and the UMP. OPINION: Old Sarkozy does not match new France\\\\\\'s needs If convicted,-Sarkozy, 62, faces up to a year in a prison.-He could yet be spared trial, however, given that the second investigating magistrate in the case disagreed that Sarkozy be put in the dock. Only one other president - Jacques Chirac - has been tried in France\\\\\\'s Fifth Republic, which was founded in 1958. He was given a two-year suspended jail term in 2011 over a fake job scandal.- The son of a Hungarian immigrant father, Sarkozy, was nicknamed the \"bling-bling\" president for his flashy displays of wealth. His trial will focus on whether he himself caused the over-spending in 2012 by demanding that additional rallies be organised towards the end of his campaign, even though they were bound to blow the budget. The judicial source said he was accused of having ignored two warnings from advisors in March and April 2012 about his spending, which came to \"at least $45.7m\". While the so-called Bygmalion case is the most pressing, Sarkozy has been fighting legal problems on several fronts. He is charged with corruption and influence peddling for allegedly offering to help a judge swing a plum retirement job in return from secret information about another case. He has also been accused by former members of-Moammar-Gaddafi\\\\\\'s regime of accepting millions in cash towards his first presidential campaign in 2007 from the-toppled Libyan leader- claims he has vehemently denied. After retiring from politics following his 2012 defeat by the Socialist Party\\\\\\'s Francois Hollande, he returned to take the helm of the Republicans and sought the party\\\\\\'s presidential nod in this year\\\\\\'s election. In a surprise result, he was eliminated in November in the first round of a primary contest, trailing the eventual winner, Fillon, and Alain Juppe, another ex-prime minister. News of Sarkozy\\\\\\'s trial comes as Fillon faces his own scandal over parliamentary jobs for his family. The presidential candidate apologised on Monday for employing his wife over 15 years as an aide - which is legal - but continued to deny the more serious allegations that she barely worked for her average monthly salary of around $3,950.

Ismail Kawasi, the public health ministry spokesman, said 41 people were also wounded in Tuesday\\\\\\'s explosion, which hit near a side door used for court employees to leave the building at the end of the work day. The attacker was on foot and detonated his suicide vest packed with explosives near the employees and other people as they were coming out of the main court building,-Najib Danish, deputy spokesman for the interior ministry, told the Associated Press news agency. INTERACTIVE: Afghanistan civilian casualties reaches record high No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but Taliban fighters have attacked the top court and its employees in the past, as well as court buildings in the other provinces. \"This is not the first attack that targeted Afghan justice system,\" Al Jazeera\\\\\\'s-Qais Azimy, reporting from Kabul, said. \"In fact the exact location, the car park of the supreme court, was targeted before in June 2013 by a suicide bomber, which killed 17 people.\" \"That\\\\\\'s why this part of the compound is heavily guarded and the employees of this court know that they are targets for Taliban,\" Azimy said. The armed group has repeatedly issued statements threatening to target employees at Afghanistan\\\\\\'s justice system \"because they are not happy with the way they are working\", our correspondent added. The Kabul bombing came hours after a roadside bombing killed the top government official of a district in western Farah province. Taliban spokesman Qari Yusouf Ahmadi said the group claimed responsibility for that attack. A Farah police spokesman, Iqbal Baher, told AP that Abdul Khaliq, the top official in the Khak-e-Safed district, was on his way home from the mosque when the explosion took place in the city of Farah, the provincial capital. Taliban fighters frequently use roadside bombs and suicide attacks to target government officials as well as Afghan security forces across the country.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday that at least 26 people were killed and casualties were expected to rise as rescue workers searched for bodies under the rubble. \"Ten civilians, mostly women, are among the dead,\" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based monitoring group tracking development\\\\\\'s in Syria\\\\\\'s conflict, told AFP news agency. READ MORE: Idlib\\\\\\'s rebel split - A crossroads for Syrian opposition Abdel Rahman said the raids were probably carried out by Russian fighter jets - allied with Syria\\\\\\'s government - or by a US-backed air coalition. The strikes also wounded scores of people and levelled several multi-storey buildings in residential areas of the northwestern city, according to witnesses, who told Reuters news agency that the extent of the damage and the debris bore the hallmarks of a Russian attack. But Russia\\\\\\'s defence ministry said later on Tuesday media reports that its planes had bombed Idlib were not true, Interfax news agency reported. The Civil Defence, a volunteer rescue group operating in rebel-held areas, gave a different death toll, saying 15 bodies were pulled from the rubble and that 30 wounded people were taken for treatment. READ MORE: Syria hanged 13,000 in notorious prison, says Amnesty Video footage by activists on social media showed civilians, including young children, being treated in a main city hospital where the injured had been taken for treatment.  \"We are still pulling bodies from the rubble,\" Issam al Idlibi, a volunteer civil defence worker, told Reuters. Russian planes have targeted a number of towns and villages in the area since entering the Syrian conflict in September 2015 to back ally President Bashar al-Assad. Activists and residents said there had been a reduction of Russian strikes in Idlib province since a Turkish-Russian brokered cessation of hostilities late December. Planes from the US-led coalition have launched a number of attacks in the rural province, a major stronghold of fighters, many of them formerly affiliated to al-Qaeda. Idlib\\\\\\'s population has been swollen by thousands of Syrian fighters and their families evacuated from villages and towns around Damascus and Aleppo city, which was retaken by the government in recent months.

Without question, and largely due to Trump\\\\\\'s obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations, she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious Glenn Beck. She is, without question, a wolf in sheep\\\\\\'s clothing. While Trump is unbelievably hard to take, constantly, we need to focus on one simple question, which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first?\\\\nI suspect it would be Hillary Clinton who would be most inclined toward involving Americans in another military conflict, and she doesn\\\\\\'t go small, as she constantly demonizes Russia with threats of military action. In Clinton\\\\\\'s own words, \"You\\\\\\'ve seen reports, Russia has hacked into a lot of things, China has hacked into a lot of things, Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee, maybe even some state election systems. So we\\\\\\'ve got to step up our game, make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us. As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.\"\\\\nMilitary responses to a nation the US stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades? Military response against Russia? Over suspected hacking? Hillary Clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with Donald Trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences.\\\\nIt all stems from the Wikileaks release that included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from leaders at the Democratic National Committee. Clinton says the Russians did it, the national mainstream media parroted those words. It\\\\\\'s the American media\\\\\\'s political conditioning system at its finest, convincingly reaching tens of millions of Americans, and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the Russians. In a USA Today article from July 2016, Elizabith Weise wrote, \"Computer security researchers say itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the Democratic National Committee subsequently posted online by Wikileaks was the work of Russian hackers, as some media outlets have reported.\"\\\\nRussia\\\\\\'s leader, Vladmir Putin, says the US long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction, well before the Cold War even ended. Peace with Russia should be a top priority for any US Presidential candidate. The truth is that American politicians, perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves, created a road block on the highway to peace during the Vietnam War. Putin said during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2016, \"It is not in my nature to scold someone -- but when the United States unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty (in) 1972 they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security. That was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world\".\\\\nMORE... 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cLesser Evilâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Now we have Clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations.\\\\nWorld Rivals in the Air\\\\nThere is a decades-old history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology. While American designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better, the fastest jet fighter ever made is the Russian MiG-25; it can break Mach III, more than three times the speed of sound. Such demands lessen the life of an aircraft. The MiG-25 is typically not flown at anything close to that speed. As an interceptor however, it was supreme, no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it.\\\\nThe Korean War was the first test. Soviet MiG-15\\\\\\'s initially dominated the skies. With Russian and Chinese pilots often at the controls, the MiG\\\\\\'s were deadly.\\\\nOn 1 November 1950, at least sixteen American F-51 fighters (P-51 Mustangs) were shot at by six Soviet MiG-15 interceptors led by Soviet WWII ace Mayor Nikolay V. Stroykov. The WWII \"prop\" planes like the Mustang, along with the U.S. F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters, had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable MiG fighters.\\\\nEverything changed when the U.S. Air Force launched the F-86 Sabre. Wikipedia explains that the F-86 Sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest. Foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six .50 caliber machine guns, which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target. F-86 pilots were also equipped with G-suits, which prevented pilot blackout in high-speed turning maneuvers.\\\\nIt is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and \"kill\" ratios over \"MiG Alley\" during the Korean War.\\\\nThe Soviets claimed 1,106 United Nations planes of all types shot down, including about 650 Sabres. (The USAF only admits to losing less than 200 aircraft in air combat.)\\\\nThe F-86 pilots claimed 792 MiG-15s shot down, while B-29 gunners claimed a further 16. These numbers were later reduced to 379 MiGs. The Chinese air force claimed only 85 kills.\\\\nIn Vietnam, the competitors varied. The MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters were widely used by the North Vietnamese Air Force. They fought planes like the F-100 Super Sabre, F-5 Tiger and the F-4 Phantom. Once again, if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part, the U.S. planes dominated in most air to air combat, though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the Americans. During the end of the Cold War in the 1980\\\\\\'s, the Soviet MiG-29 was the terror of the skies. There was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first. While MiG aircraft were only built in odd numbers, the movie Top Gun references the aircraft by calling them MiG-28\\\\\\'s - \"MiG-28\\\\\\'s, no one\\\\\\'s been this close before!\" The planes used in the movie were actually American F-5 Tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails. Today the United States spends obscene amounts on planes like the F-22 Raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern Russian planes like the SU-30. Both in this case, are capable of \"thrust vectoring\" which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight. The ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the AV8/b Harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter. Hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war, but with Clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the US used to hold over the Russian military have evaporated into thin air.\\\\nRussia\\\\\\'s Modern Approach to Warfare\\\\nDuring the decades-long Cold War, the Soviet Union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander, or a pilot, from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order. Kemp Freund, a US Army sergeant major that I met while I was covering the war in Afghanistan, was Quote: d in my 2007 video report \"Camp Joyce: Remote Fire Base Near Afghanistan-Pakistan Border\" saying, \"We\\\\\\'re trying to break the old Soviet methods that they use and the Soviet method had that Lt. Col. completely in the dark until he needed to move.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d He added, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\\\'re still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill.\" The Soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now. Today\\\\\\'s Russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than US taxpayer funded military planes, they also utilize tactics of Western pilots. Hillary Clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another \"war president\" which was so important to former President George W. Bush, and Obama too for that matter.\\\\nOther Looming Conflicts\\\\nLest we forget, Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s unwavering support of Israel, the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by US taxpayer money and military hardware. The government of right wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of Palestinians constantly, while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law. Then there are the attacks in Gaza that target schools and hospitals, leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured. Never does Clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment Israel reserves for non-Jews, never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call Iran hasn\\\\\\'t attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years.

Kara-Murza\\\\\\'s wife, Yevgenia, told CNN that doctors have tried to bring her husband out of a medically-induced coma but that when they did so, he \"had almost no reaction at all, except to his name being called.\" He is currently on dialysis and artificial ventilation. She said doctors have diagnosed him with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance\" and that there is \"no prognosis,\" adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness. Prokhorov told CNN that an investigator from the Khamovniki district of Moscow contacted him last Friday to inquire about the circumstances which led to Kara-Murza\\\\\\'s hospitalization, but has not received any further updates about the ongoing investigation. \"The problem is that they are not paying any real attention to this,\" Prokhorov said. \"The investigative committee is only interested in this situation because of the media coverage.\" He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in Kara-Murza\\\\\\'s 2015 illness. Moscow denies involvement in 2015 health scare CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after a mysterious illness nearly killed him. \"I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver,\" he said at the time. He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. \"Frankly there is no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don\\\\\\'t have any money dealings. I don\\\\\\'t have any personal enemies. I didn\\\\\\'t steal anybody\\\\\\'s wife.\" The case had parallels with the killing of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London. A British public inquiry into that 2006 poisoning found two former Russian agents responsible for carrying out the poisoning with the radioactive isotope Polonium-210. Its final report concluded that Putin was \"probably\" aware of the operation. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated and the Kremlin said Russia wasn\\\\\\'t involved. In February 2015, a leading Russian opposition figure and friend of Kara-Murza, Boris Nemtsov, was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. US lawmakers urge investigation Kara-Murza\\\\\\'s hospitalization has triggered an outcry from US lawmakers, who have called on the Trump administration to speak out on his behalf. US Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Putin should be held accountable if there is evidence the government poisoned Kara-Murza. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,\" said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. \"I am praying that Kara-Murza\\\\\\'s condition improves.\" He urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. Kara-Murza, who splits his time between Russia and his family home in Virginia, is a dual Russian-British citizen. He is part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. When he fell ill last week, Kara-Murza was touring Russia for screenings of a documentary about Nemtsov.\\'\\n \\'Somalia\\\\\\'s capital is on lockdown a day before the parliament meets to elect a new president, with ongoing security concerns and warnings of famine expected to top the agenda for the incoming administration.- Roads in Mogadishu were closed, businesses asked to shut, and schools and universities gave students a two-day break. In the run-up to the election, al-Shabab fighters have stepped up their attacks against government installations and- hotels in the capital .- Bishar Abshir, Mogadishu police chief, told Al Jazeera that security forces were working to ensure that the election is concluded peacefully. \"We appeal to the public to be patient and cooperate with us as we deter the enemies of peace from carrying out attacks,\" he told Al Jazeera. Al-Shabab, which aims -to topple the country\\\\\\'s UN-backed government,- has carried out- hundreds of attacks -in Somalia.- INTERACTIVE: Al-Shabab attacks in Somalia (2006-2017) The presidential election had been due to take place in August, four years after the previous vote in which just 135 clan elders chose MPs who then voted for the country\\\\\\'s leader. But political infighting and insecurity, mainly due to al-Shabab, which controls swaths of countryside and strikes at will in Mogadishu, saw the plan ditched for a limited vote running months behind schedule. The troubled Horn of Africa nation, which has not had an effective central government in three decades, had been promised a one-person, one-vote election in 2016. Elections instead began in October with an electoral college system that excluded ordinary citizens and instead involved 14,025 delegates voting for candidates for both parliament and a new upper house. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of the conservative Peace and Development Party is seeking a second term after more than four years in office, during which he has faced criticism from the public and western donors about corruption. Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, a former diplomat, and former president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed are also among the 24 candidates registered for the election. About a third of MPs are loyal to the president\\\\\\'s party. While this gives Mohamud an advantage in the race, it is not enough to guarantee him victory. The elections have been marred by widespread allegations of vote-buying and intimidation. In a report on Tuesday, Somalia-based anti-corruption watchdog Marqaati said the elections \"were rife with corruption\".  READ MORE: Al-Shabab attack at Mogadishu hotel \\\\\\'kills 28\\\\\\' While falling well short of the direct election that was promised, the process is more democratic than in the past and is seen as a step towards universal suffrage, now hoped for in 2020. Wednesday\\\\\\'s voting will see members of the 275-seat parliament and 54 senators cast ballots inside a hangar within the heavily-guarded airport. No candidate is expected to get the two-thirds majority needed for a first-round win, with two further rounds permitted before a winner is declared. In the absence of political parties, clan remains the organising principle of Somali politics. The overthrow of president Siad Barre\\\\\\'s military regime in 1991 ushered in decades of anarchy and conflict in a country deeply divided along clan lines.  The clan rivalries and lawlessness provided fertile ground for al-Shabab to take hold and seize territory, frustrating efforts to set up a central administration. Al-Shabab has been in decline since 2011, but still launches regular, deadly attacks against government, military and civilian targets in the capital Mogadishu and elsewhere. Security and overcoming Somalia\\\\\\'s adversarial and divisive politics will top the agenda for whoever wins the vote, as will dealing with a growing humanitarian crisis. The United Nations warned last week of \"possible famine\" in Somalia as a severe drought has pushed nearly three million people to the edge of starvation. After two failed rain seasons, aid workers fear a repeat of a 2010-11 drought which left more than 250,000 dead. \"The levels of suffering in the country, triggered by protracted conflict, seasonal shocks and outbreaks of disease, are typically hard to bear, but the impact of this drought represents a threat of a different scale and magnitude,\" the UN\\\\\\'s office for humanitarian affairs said in a statement last week.

This gentleman came and brought it out into the open in the election and after the election.\" He referred to the case of a young Iranian boy who was pictured in handcuffs at a US airport following Trump\\\\\\'s ban on visas from Iran, among other countries. \"By what he does - handcuffing a five-year-old child - he shows the true meaning of American human rights,\" Khamenei said. Iran is one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries that the Trump administration tried to ban from entering the US. The related executive order last week was frozen by the US judiciary and an appeals court is to hear Trump\\\\\\'s latest arguments to reinstate the ban. Khamenei-also responded to Trump\\\\\\'s tweet of February 3, when the US president said: \"Iran is playing with fire - they don\\\\\\'t appreciate how \\\\\\'kind\\\\\\' President Obama was to them.\" He ridiculed the idea of being grateful to former President Barack Obama, saying he was the one who placed \"paralysing sanctions\" on Iran and helped create the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group through his destabilising actions in Iraq and Syria.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani earlier criticised Trump\\\\\\'s statements regarding his country\\\\\\'s nuclear deal with Washington and other major powers. He called the nuclear agreement \"a win-win agreement\", in response to Trump, who said it was \"the worst deal in history\".  \"The nuclear talks should be used as an example for other talks for stability and security in the region,\" he said. World powers and Iran reached a landmark deal in July 2015 to curb the country\\\\\\'s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that with Trump in the White House, Tehran faced \"difficult days ahead\" on the nuclear deal. \"I believe Trump may try to renegotiate\" the deal, but \"clearly, neither Iran, nor the Europeans or the international community will accept new negotiations,\" Zarif told Ettelaat newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday. Source:-Al Jazeera and news agencies\\'\\n \\'The first Grad multiple launch rockets were fired from areas under Kremlin-backed militant control hit Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine only a day after US President Donald Trump held his first official phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. While some viewed the timing of this attack as a chilling confirmation of the new United States administration\\\\\\'s willingness to make deals with Moscow at Ukraine\\\\\\'s expense, neither the motives behind the sudden escalation, nor-its-effect on the current situation are that straightforward. There were certainly grounds for concern and the feeling of-angst, only strengthened when a Kremlin spokesperson said that the recent escalation in Ukraine proved the need for \"dialogue\" between the US and Russia.- It is implementation of the Minsk Agreement that is required, not \"dialogue\". This, however, includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of all heavy weapons-and, eventually, the securing of the Russian-Ukrainian border. But Russia is actively trying get the Minsk-linked sanctions lifted without fulfilling the commitments it made. The fears of some Ukrainians that the new US administration may be amenable to make deals with Russia that bypass the conditions of the Minsk Agreement are not unfounded. Even if we ignore the US intelligence report demonstrating that Russia directly interfered in the US elections to get Trump elected, Trump\\\\\\'s own statements have given Ukraine reason to fear for the future of US support to Ukraine and its commitment to the sanctions. Since Russia\\\\\\'s invasion and annexation of Crimea, Trump has on numerous occasions praised Putin, even calling Russia\\\\\\'s aggression against Ukraine \"smart\". During the election campaign, he stated that they \"would be looking into\" recognising Crimea as a Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Moscow. He has even dismissed-Russia\\\\\\'s involvement in the downing of the Malaysian MH17 airliner over militant-controlled territory in July 2014 despite compelling evidence. It was after that disaster that hard-hitting sanctions were imposed on Russia and these sanctions were tied to Moscow\\\\\\'s compliance with the Minsk Agreement. Trump\\\\\\'s people have been actively meeting with Russians and fuelling Moscow\\\\\\'s hopes that sanctions will be lifted. There is also an ongoing campaign-to push the claim that sanctions \"don\\\\\\'t work\" and that Ukraine may have to \"give up\"-Crimea in exchange for some kind of a peace deal in Eastern Ukraine. The sanctions, including those over Crimea, are hurting Russia hard and the Kremlin needs them lifted. But if it hoped to steer \"dialogue\" on to such deals by escalating the conflict, its plan may have backfired. Avdiivka, a strategically important city under Ukrainian control, came under attack on January 28. A Bellingcat report has confirmed reports and videos indicating that the intensive shelling of the city was carried out from residential parts of militant-controlled Donetsk. Moscow\\\\\\'s attempt to blame Ukraine for this escalation was largely rejected by the international community, since the scale of the attack, and the use of Grad missiles and other heavy artillery makes it inconceivable that this attack was carried out without Moscow\\\\\\'s approval. Andrei Piontkovsky, a Russian political analyst, suggested that Russian military personnel may have been in charge of the operation. Western journalists who visited Avdiivka have also reported evidence of \"a psychological warfare operation of a sophistication that suggested Russian involvement\".-Ukrainian soldiers, for example, were bombarded with text messages saying: \"You\\\\\\'re just meat to your commanders.\" Another reason for assuming Russian military involvement in this attack is that the the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) officials in Vienna were warned of a likely escalation on January 26. Daniel Baer, the former US ambassador to the OSCE, recently pointed out that even if fighting is on both sides, this is still a situation where \"Ukraine is the victim and Russia the aggressor\". Baer, however, was removed on January 20, and it remains to be seen whether the new US Mission to the OSCE will continue to take a firm stand on this issue. This is, after all, the critical question. Whether or not the order came from the Kremlin directly, Ukraine is in no doubt that Moscow\\\\\\'s primary aim remains the same - to retain its grip on Ukraine through the debilitating and destabilising effect of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People\\\\\\'s Republics are entirely artificial creations, propped by Russian money, weapons and fighters. Real implementation of the Minsk Agreement would almost certainly lead to their collapse. The militants themselves have acknowledged having no interest in the Minsk Agreement working. READ MORE: Losing everything in Avdiivka Russia knows this and does not want to relinquish its control over Ukraine. The Russian-backed militants continue to delay releasing hostages and violate ceasefires. The White House was very slow in reacting to the new escalation and during his phone conversation with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Trump only mentioned, rather oddly, that the US is willing to help \"restore peace along the border\". Nonetheless Nikki Haley, the new US Ambassador to the UN, has come out with a clear statement indicating that there is no change in policy, either on Crimea or on the Minsk agreements. This leaves Russia with the option of trying to discredit the Minsk agreements inside Ukraine or to prove that Kiev is at fault. One motive for the carnage and suffering caused in Avdiivka may have been to convince Ukrainians - and perhaps the US - that the Minsk accords are not working and should be abandoned. If the Trump administration is hoping to come to some kind of arrangement with Putin, it would probably want to avoid doing so by lifting sanctions when agreement conditions have not been met, and when other countries are standing by them. There are certainly voices of disgruntlement inside Ukraine, but there is understanding that the removal of sanctions against Russia will encourage its aggression further. As political commentator Serhiy Taran warned, if Ukraine turns away from the Minsk Agreement, there will be no western leverage to put pressure on Russia. Moscow may, however, have made one other miscalculation. In 2014, Ukraine was in no state to defend itself properly after four years of the Viktor Yanukovych regime. During the latest offensive, the country showed its strength. There was extraordinarily efficient cooperation between the military, government agencies and civilian organisations ensuring that people in the besieged city cut off from electricity and heating had somewhere to go. In other cities, hundreds waited patiently to donate blood. Ukraine is not broken and will defend itself. The latest offensive has, nonetheless, demonstrated how cynically Moscow will use weapons of death and destruction for its own questionable gains. This is a lesson the new Trump administration would do well to heed before attempting any deals with Putin. Halya Coynash is a journalist and member of the Kharkiv Human Rights Group.

This week, I will outline what to expect from a Hillary Clinton Presidency. The great migration of Republicans into the Democratic Party tent of Hillary Clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic US Presidential elections. Corporate media outlets have collaborated with Clinton to instill deep popular fear of a Trump administration. Fear of Trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the US who are fed up with both corporate parties. This has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once Hillary Clinton actually takes office.\\\\nThe corporate media has exploited the general population\\\\\\'s distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process. Trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement, all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist. It is critical that the left in the US extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day. However, Trump\\\\\\'s vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. His characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a Clinton Presidency.\\\\nOne could endlessly debate Clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim. Trump\\\\\\'s vulgar and putrid presentation has provided Clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice. Yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the 2016 elections. It is reasonable to assume that a Hillary Clinton Presidency will be far less effective than Obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony. This is why her support system, the entire ruling class, has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a Russia-Trump collaborative threat in every sphere of US political life.\\\\nHere are ten things to expect from a Clinton Presidency. I will leave it to readers to judge as to whether Clinton represents a \"lesser evil\" than Trump or just plain evil.\\\\n1.) The Privatization of Social Security - Hillary Clinton has stated publicly and privately to her Wall Street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program. Wikileaks exposed Clinton\\\\\\'s support for the Obama\\\\\\'s Administration\\\\\\'s \"deficit reduction\" commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare in 2012. Clinton donors on Wall Street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of Social Security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit.\\\\nMORE... Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cLesser Evilâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d John Pilger: Clinton policies will bring great aggression to the US and the world 2.) World War III - Hillary Clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a no-fly zone in Syria. That means US airstrikes would rain down on Syrian and Russian assets in Syria. Such a move would place the US military in direct confrontation with the Russia. Clinton has been caught stating that the Syrian and Russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits.\\\\n3.) The Transpacific Partnership - Often called \"NAFTA on steroids,\" the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of Asia Pacific region has been a major talking point in the 2016 elections. Clinton has supported the agreement in the past, only to switch her position due to pressure from the Bernie Sanders campaign. With Sanders firmly in the Clinton camp, there is currently nothing in the way to stop Clinton from moving forward with the TPP\\\\\\'s passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality.\\\\n4.) Maintenance and Expansion of the Surveillance State - Not much needs to be said here. The Obama Administration\\\\\\'s vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of Ed Snowden and Julian Assange. Wikileaks additionally revealed Clinton\\\\\\'s desire to drone Julian Assange for releasing Washingtonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s secrets to the public. A Clinton Presidency has every intention of following up on the Obama Administration\\\\\\'s passage of bills such as the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. This bill gave the US government the right to militarily detain \"terror\" suspects indefinitely.\\\\n5.) Trump\\\\\\'s Wall - Hillary Clinton was Obama\\\\\\'s Secretary of State from 2009-2013. Over this time, she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in US history. Furthermore, she oversaw the detention of thousands of Central American children during the great migration from the 2009 fascist coup in Honduras, a coup that was drawn up by Clinton herself. The US-Mexico border is more militarized than it has ever been. Trump\\\\\\'s wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip, but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current US immigration policy.\\\\n6.) Servitude to the Bankers - Hillary Clinton has received over forty million in support from Hedge funds in the 2016 elections. Before selling out, Bernie Sanders made it a point to request public access into Clinton\\\\\\'s private, quarter million dollar speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs. The deregulation of the banks with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act was a Clinton project. Both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbandâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class.\\\\n7.) Maintenance of the Mass Black Incarceration State - Hillary Clinton is the enemy of Black America. From her callous use of the term \"super predator\" to describe working class Black men to being the architect of the 1994 crime bill, the Clinton dynasty virtually built the mass Black incarceration state. Under Bill and Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s two terms, the prison population rose by 673,000. This was facilitated by draconian \"three strikes\" laws, mandatory drug sentence, and the deep militarization of local police departments. With her record, it isn\\\\\\'t too difficult to assume what another four years of Clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons.\\\\n8.) Austerity and More Austerity - It was the first Clinton Administration that eliminated \"welfare as we know it.\" The evisceration of Aid to Families and Dependent Children (AFDC) and its replacement, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), threw millions of women and children into poverty. Obama has followed up with draconian cuts to SNAP (foodstamps). There is nothing on Clinton\\\\\\'s track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the US.\\\\n9.) A Boost to the Privatization of Education - Hillary Clinton received boos in July when she urged teachers\\\\\\' unions and charter operators to \"work together\" for the greater good of students. Ever since, Clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of Sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her. Her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education, but that hardly matters. Clinton receives broad support from school privatizers (like Wal-Mart) and should not be expected to roll back the \"shock and awe\" war on public education waged by the Obama Administration.\\\\n10.) An Economic Crisis - Bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of 2016. Capitalists everywhere were given free rein to \"recover\" with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in 2008. The internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates. Whether Clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well Obama has remains to be seen.\\\\nClinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season. Her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than Donald Trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class. The question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the two-party corporate duopoly. Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka are attempting to build the base of the Green party ticket. Whatever method is chosen, it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a Clinton Administration.\\'\\n \"Wet and wintry weather has caused widespread disruption across the Pacific Northwest of the United States, with-the heaviest snowfall to hit the area in several years. The storm started on Sunday night and made for a nasty Monday morning commute across the greater Seattle area. The snowstorm that blanketed Seattle and Western Washington State, causing huge travel delays and major power cuts. Dozens of schools were forced to close, much to the delight of many of the pupils. Dozens of flights were cancelled at Seattle-Tacoma Airport-due to snow and ice and more than 90,000 customers found themselves without electricity at some stage. Snow accumulations amounted to 36cm in places. It is still snowing and forecasters predict as much as 75cm of snow could fall in the Cascade Mountains by the end of Tuesday. Snow is actually quite rare in Seattle because it is so close to the relatively warm waters of the Pacific Ocean. - Portland was also badly affected, and there were concerns that the city would be hit by a major snowstorm. Those concerns did not materialise because temperatures remained high enough above freezing. In the event, Portland, which is a very wet place at the best of times, had more than half a month\\'s worth of rain in just 24 hours. Some 52mm fell on Sunday, making a total of 80mm in three days. The February average is 80mm. It was even wetter in the state capital, Salem, with a downpour of 64mm on Sunday, and 122mm in three days. That easily surpassed the February average of 116mm. Many rivers in the western side of the state have been pushed close to flood levels. More rain is forecast for much of this week so flooding is possible before drier weather arrives this weekend.

The so-called Regulation Law, passed on Monday night, allows for the retroactive legalisation of about 4,000 homes built by Jewish settlers on privately owned Palestinian land. \"The law sets a new legal framework that implements the Israeli political interest and puts it above international humanitarian law,\"-Suhad Bishara, a lawyer at the Adalah legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel, told Al Jazeera. The law violates both the right to property and the right to dignity, Bishara said. \"The most obvious case here is that it violates property rights, because it basically confiscates private property for the sake of the illegal settlers,\" she said. \"But we cannot avoid the aspect of dignity here, and humiliation, and no value at all for the rights of the Palestinian owners of the land.\" READ MORE: Israel\\\\\\'s settlement bill \\\\\\'big step towards annexation\\\\\\' Before the bill was passed, Israel\\\\\\'s attorney general said that it was unconstitutional and that he would not be able to defend it. Along with other rights groups, Adalah is set to file a petition against the law to Israel\\\\\\'s Supreme Court later this week, as well as asking for a temporary order not to implement the law until Israel\\\\\\'s highest court gives a final decision. According to the Israeli rights group Peace Now, the law will allow for the expropriation of land in more than 50 settlements and outposts. There are 16 cases where demolition orders have already been issued by Israeli authorities, including land in the settlements of Ofra, Eli and Beit El, among others. As a result of the new law, the settlers in these illegal outposts would be allowed to remain in their homes. Palestinian lawmakers in the Knesset denounced the law, calling it a direct challenge to the international community in the wake of December\\\\\\'s United Nations Security Council resolution that called for an end to settlement building. \"From the political point of view and from the legal point of view, this law should not have been legislated. This is a law that is meant to implement the creeping annexation of Palestinian occupied lands to Israel,\" Aida Touma-Suleiman, an MK with the Arab Joint List, told Al Jazeera. \"This is a law that is challenging the international community. It\\\\\\'s arrogant behaviour by this government, who are not willing to pay attention to what the international community is [saying]. It is about time to hold them responsible for the decisions and laws they are legislating.\" Gilad Grossman, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights NGO Yesh Din, said that the law has stripped Palestinian landowners of any chance to reclaim their land. \"What it means is that Palestinian landowners can\\\\\\'t get their land back, whether they want to or not,\" he said. READ MORE: Palestinians call Israel settlement expansion a \\\\\\'war crime\\\\\\' As a result of the new law, Palestinian landowners only have the option of financial compensation, Grossman added - \"to go through the system of the people who stole your land and to ask for them to give you some money, as much as they decide to give you, on the conditions they decide with the proof they demand\". The ownership of the land itself will remain in the hands of the Palestinian landowners, although they will not be able to access or use it. \"It\\\\\\'s a very cynical law,\" Grossman noted. \"It basically means that they own the land and can get it back in the future, if there will be some kind of political agreement and decision regarding the West Bank. It was stolen and now it\\\\\\'s being leased against their will basically, and there\\\\\\'s nothing they can do about it.\" On Tuesday morning, Israel\\\\\\'s high court ruled that 17 buildings in the illegal outpost of Tapuach Maarav would have to be demolished by 2018.

Back in 2007, Al Jazeera\\\\\\'s Andrew Simmons travelled to The Gambia to meet then-President Yahya Jammeh and found himself spending time with a charismatic leader who believed he could personally cure asthma and even Aids. To update the film,-REWIND spoke to Al Jazeera correspondent Nicolas Haque about the curious staying power of the country\\\\\\'s former dictator. \"This idea that he could heal HIV and Aids, this disease that affects so many people, was seen in Gambia as a way for him to enforce his position of power,\" Haque said.

Its recapture last August by Iraqi forces was a significant gain in their advance towards Mosul. Before fleeing, ISIL fighters used explosives to torch several oil wells, initially as a defensive measure to thwart coalition air strikes. But as the group began losing ground to Iraqi forces, they adopted a scorched-earth strategy, destroying as many oil wells as possible. The operation to extinguish the fires, now in its fifth month, is proving to be a difficult, dangerous and time-consuming task. Teams of firefighters, machine operators, mechanics, engineers and safety experts have come from across the country to join the effort - but regardless of when the flames are extinguished, the human and environmental costs will probably linger for years.\\'\\n \\'There is plenty of proof the machines are rigged whic also means trhe polls are rigged to match the machines so they must all know about it .

Although Trump has not yet elaborated on his policy towards Afghanistan, his harsh and blunt criticisms of Washington\\\\\\'s ills, of the-opportunistic and duplicitous US-allies and of the US\\\\\\' failure to win wars resonate with many Afghans. Trump is the fifth US president to deal with Afghanistan as a central foreign policy issue and national security concern. For his four predecessors - Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George W Bush and Barack Obama - Afghanistan was an inescapable crisis and an inherited challenge.  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the terrorist attacks of 9/11 made the country one of Washington\\\\\\'s foreign policy priorities for nearly four decades. Trump has now inherited a 16-year-old conflict with direct US military involvement and a political quagmire within a regime it helped install. Kabul is paralysed by a stalled political process, rampant corruption, a resilient terrorist group and Pakistan\\\\\\'s stubborn obsession with making Afghanistan its strategic depth. On his first day of his presidency, Trump encouraged US soldiers based in Afghanistan, saying, \"Keep fighting. We\\\\\\'re going to win. We\\\\\\'re going to win.\"-As a hyper self-confident businessman with impeccable corporate skill, to win in Afghanistan where Obama failed, Trump needs to know that he cannot go about business as usual. In the coming weeks, Trump and his national security team will be reading and listening to many assessments and proposals on the way forward in Afghanistan. The new US administration must begin by critically examining Washington\\\\\\'s assumptions, approaches and partners in Afghanistan in a broader regional and global context. One prevailing assumption in Washington is the perception of the US\\\\\\' misplaced priority in promoting \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan, compounded by rampant Afghan corruption. OPINION: No consensus in Afghanistan on how to deal with Taliban Both Obama and Trump have criticised US involvement in \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan and promised to end it. However, neither of them defined or clarified their understanding of \"nation-building\". This confusion has been exacerbated by Washington\\\\\\'s simplistic and partial understanding of the root causes of corruption in Afghanistan and its denial of western entities having a role in it. The massive waste, incompetence, corruption, hypocrisy, and unaccountability within western entities are actually significantly under-reported. The recently released report on the massive $125bn waste in the Pentagon, or the leaked information on the monthly payment of $150,000 by Ashraf Ghani\\\\\\'s election team to influence Washington\\\\\\'s view on fraud during the 2014 Afghan presidential election, show that corruption is not exclusively an oriental sin. To paraphrase former US Sectary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the mission no longer determines the coalition in Afghanistan; instead, the many coalition members determine the mission, which results in incoherence and contradictions. - Afghanistan is the place where Trump\\\\\\'s criticism of NATO and European performance are valid. The US has two types of European and NATO partners in Afghanistan: the reluctant partners and the dubious ones. The former are some European allies, who would literally not fight after tea time due to the restriction on their combat role; the latter are those who systematically undermine US objectives by legitimising the Taliban in the guise of peace talks and shielding Pakistan\\\\\\'s detrimental policies in Afghanistan. To paraphrase former US Sectary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the mission no longer determines the coalition in Afghanistan; instead, the many coalition members determine the mission, which has resulted in incoherence and contradictions. Regional policy and the choice of regional partners is another area where Washington made a huge mistake. US policies have been primarily Pakistan-centric. As early as 2003, Pakistan\\\\\\'s duplicitous role was recognised by US intelligence and diplomatic stations in the region, but Washington chose to ignore their warnings. Despite growing evidence of Pakistan\\\\\\'s systematic support to various terrorist groups and its nuclear proliferation, Pakistan was recognised as US\\\\\\' major non-NATO ally in 2004 and has received more than $30bn of military and economic assistance since 2002 (PDF). On the other hand, US\\\\\\' natural ally in the region, India, has been constantly discouraged from assuming an active role in stabilising Afghanistan. Washington\\\\\\'s wrong assumptions about Afghanistan and its unreliable Afghan partners compounded its other misfortune. Washington allowed British colonial thinking, Pakistan\\\\\\'s hegemonic agenda and a number of Afghan-Americans\\\\\\' personal and ethnic ambitions to manipulate Washington\\\\\\'s mindset and shape US policies and strategies in Afghanistan. These intellectual manipulations and misunderstandings resulted in three principal political and institutional errors. One is imposing one of the world\\\\\\'s most rigid centralised political orders on one of the world\\\\\\'s most diverse societies. This was followed by the institutionalisation of patronage politics and of political domination enjoyed by self-proclaimed representatives of one ethnic group at the expense of the consolidation of democratic politics. Washington\\\\\\'s ambiguous relations with the Taliban was the third mistake. Despite Taliban\\\\\\'s consistent actions and rhetoric confirming they are an integral part of radical Islamist movements, the US diplomats and Obama administration treated the Taliban as a-misguided-indigenous rural Pashtun group. Unlike Syria which has become a land of no options, the post-Taliban political structure in Afghanistan still enjoys broad domestic, regional and international support, including bipartisan backing in the US.  The new US administration has to strengthen the principal foundation of this architecture: democratic and inclusive politics, regional consensus, and long-term international support, including US commitment to the Afghanistan-US Bilateral Security Agreement. This has to be reinforced by addressing the wrong assumptions of the previous administrations, confronting Afghan and regional spoilers and fixing incompetencies in Washington and within the coalition. Obama\\\\\\'s Afghan policy was premised on the idea of \"peace through appeasement\". But the Afghan war can only be won by \"peace through strength\", which can only be achieved through a functioning democratic and sovereign political order in Kabul. Afghanistan is the place where Islamic radicalism was born and nurtured by the West, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and even Maoist China, in their ideological and geostrategic competition with the Soviet Union (PDF). Although the US succeeded in defeating its arch communist rival in Afghanistan in the 1980s, it has been struggling to defeat its new global enemy: terrorist groups. Its victory in Afghanistan will also affect the global struggle against this threat, both symbolically and strategically.

Methods include slapping the head \"to hurt sensitive organs like the nose, ears, brow and lips\", forcing a handcuffed individual to squat against a wall for long periods of time, and placing the suspect bent backwards over a chair with his arms and legs cuffed. The interrogators\\\\\\' accounts echo what Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups-have long documented. Prisoners\\\\\\' rights NGO Addameer said that such practices \"are known to be routinely and systematically used against Palestinian detainees\". Other torture methods used against Palestinians include sleep deprivation and threats against family members, an Addameer spokesperson told Al Jazeera. READ MORE: Palestinians forever changed by Israeli torture Rachel Stroumsa, the executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), said that her NGO was aware of hundreds of complaints and allegations along these lines. In addition to interrogation being used to gain information about future acts, \"our experience is that torture is also used to obtain confessions regarding past acts\", Stroumsa told Al Jazeera. In its annual-report-last year, Amnesty International found that Israeli forces and Shin Bet personnel had \"tortured and otherwise ill-treated Palestinian detainees, including children, particularly during arrest and interrogation\", with methods including \"beating with batons, slapping, throttling, prolonged shackling, stress positions, sleep deprivation and threats\". A representative of Defence for Children International - Palestine told Al Jazeera that the group\\\\\\'s research had shown that almost two-thirds of Palestinian children detained in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces had endured physical violence after their arrest. Interrogators use position abuse, threats and isolation to coerce confessions from some children, and Israeli military court judges seldom exclude these confessions. Ayed Abu Qtaish, accountability programme director at Defence for Children International - Palestine \"Palestinian children are regularly subjected to coercive and violent interrogation techniques intended to extract confessions,\" said Ayed Abu Qtaish, the group\\\\\\'s accountability programme director. \"Interrogators use position abuse, threats and isolation to coerce confessions from some children, and Israeli military court judges seldom exclude these confessions.\" Torture and ill-treatment are so rife, human rights campaigners say, that convictions of Palestinians for \"security offences\" are fundamentally unreliable, not least because the abuse is part of a wider lack of due process. According to one study, as many as 91 percent of Palestinian detainees interrogated by the Shin Bet in the occupied West Bank-are held incommunicado for either part or all of their interrogation. Stroumsa says this practice is \"an enabling element for torture\". In the military court system, which has a 99 percent conviction rate, Palestinians can be held for 60 days without access to a lawyer - compared with-the United States, where the average length of interrogations producing false confessions is 16 hours. \"As Palestinian children continue to experience systematic ill-treatment and denial of due process rights, it becomes evident that military courts have no interest in justice,\" Abu Qtaish said.  In addition to the torture and lack of access to counsel, Palestinians are asked to sign confession sheets in Hebrew, which they often do not understand. All of this \"creates a coercive environment which results in confessions made under duress\", Addameer noted.- A recent example is the case of Mohammad el-Halabi, a Gaza-based employee of World Vision who was charged by Israel with funnelling money to Hamas. Halabi, who is being tried in a Beer Sheva civilian court, has protested his innocence, saying that he was tortured by his interrogators. These claims were also made by his lawyers, who Halabi was prevented from seeing for three weeks after his arrest. The new Haaretz report draws attention to a topic that is not often in the limelight. In November 2015, a video of the interrogation of 13-year-old Ahmad Manasra sparked outrage, while Israel\\\\\\'s appearance at the United Nations Committee Against Torture last May - which referred to \"coerced evidence\" being used in courts - also gained coverage. But many other events fly under the radar. An academic study published in November 2015 in a peer-reviewed medical journal revealed dozens of cases of sexual torture and ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel. READ MORE: Report details \\\\\\'inhuman\\\\\\' treatment in Israeli jail Activists on the ground say that an international spotlight on Israel\\\\\\'s torture practices is urgently needed, not least because of the institutionalised nature of the problem.- Although an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in 1999 prohibited \"physical means\" of interrogation, Shin Bet agents were effectively given impunity for torture and ill-treatment by the so-called \"necessity defence\" or \" ticking bomb\" exemption. According to anti-torture campaigners, this exemption has served as a green light for torture ever since. Since 2001, hundreds of formal complaints have been made against Shin Bet interrogators, but not a single criminal investigation has been opened. \"I think international pressure is essential, and has on some issues proven its efficacy,\" Stroumsa said. \"It is also the duty of the international community to speak out on abuses, given the massive economic and political support for the State of Israel from abroad.\" Source:-Al Jazeera\\'\\n \\'Dutch far-right MP Geert Wilders, known for his comments attacking Islam and Muslims, has triggered a fight over fake news, after posting a Twitter message showing a digitally altered picture of another party leader at a rally. Some five weeks before key elections in The Netherlands, Wilders on Monday posted the fake picture of D66 leader Alexander Pechtold supposedly at a rally with Muslims holding up signs reading: \"Islam will conquer Europe\" and \"Shariah for The Netherlands\", referring to Islamic law. Wilders\\\\\\' anti-Islam and anti-immigrant platform has helped propel his Freedom Party (PVV) to the top of the opinion polls in recent months in advance of the March 15 vote. In his tweet, he accused Pechtold, who heads the pro-European, social-liberal D66 party of \"demonstrating with Hamas terrorists\". D66 wil Amsterdam afsplitsen als de verkiezingsuitslag tegenvalt. Pechtold demonstreert met Hamas-terroristen. Is dit de volgende stap? pic.twitter.com/U07jHfQmyh D66 is one of 28 parties contesting the election and is currently trailing fifth in the polls. Wilders\\\\\\' taunt prompted an angry reaction from Pechtold. \"Usually, I laugh at Photoshopped pictures on the internet. But not this time,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \"Not because I can\\\\\\'t stand up for myself ... but because it gives people false impressions.\"  Last year, Pechtold sued a PVV supporter over photos that sparked death threats against him. \"In these times of fake news and alternative facts, we can\\\\\\'t just ignore the consequences that such a fake image can have,\" he said. \"I draw the line today.\" The AFP news agency reported that other politicians also sided with Pechtold.

Asa Hutchinson, and goes into effect later this year. It prohibits dismemberment abortion, the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. A clause in the law states that the husband of a woman getting the abortion can sue the doctor to stop his wife\\\\\\'s abortion. The husband has to be the father of the child. And because there\\\\\\'s no exemption in the law for rape or incest, a woman\\\\\\'s rapist could theoretically file suit to stop the abortion. The ACLU of Arkansas claims the law is unconstitutional and plans to challenge it in court before it goes into effect. One Arkansas lawmaker said there wasn\\\\\\'t much debate about those parts of the law. \"It was not something that was talked about on the Senate floor,\" Arkansas state Sen. Joyce Elliott told CNN affiliate KARK. \"If we cannot make headway on something like an exception for rape and incest, I think it just felt kind of fruitless to make some sense out of the rest of what was in the bill.\" Elliott added, \"They don\\\\\\'t see the outrage in constantly putting the thumb on women to dictate what they can do and not do.\" But another lawmaker believes husbands should have a voice in these decisions. \"I think a woman does have control over her own body, but when you have created a life, you created a life with someone else,\" said state Sen. Missy Irvin. Kansas and Oklahoma passed similar abortion laws which are tied up in the courts, according to CNN affiliate KFSM. A few states, with conservative lawmakers emboldened by Donald Trump\\\\\\'s election, have passed strict new abortion laws, including Ohio, which passed a measure banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\\'\\n \\'Residents of Yakla, an impoverished Yemeni town that was targeted last month in the first US military raid in the country authorised by President Donald Trump, have said more than a dozen civilians were killed in the botched operation. Locals told Al Jazeera that at least-16 civilians, including women and children, were killed in the raid in Bayda province that also resulted in the death of one US commando and injured three others. The Pentagon said the raid, which included-helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones,-targeted al-Qaeda leaders. But local journalist Mujahid al-Selalee said Abdulraouf al-Dhahab,-a tribal leader whose house was attacked in the raid,-had repeatedly denied being a member of the armed group.- \"He [Dhahab] made clear on numerous occasions that he has no ties with al-Qaeda. He denied that over and over and we know that based on those living with him,\" Selalee told Al Jazeera. \"One of his brothers was associated with al-Qaeda, but he was killed by a drone a while back.\" Al-Qaeda mourned Dhahab\\\\\\'s death, calling him a \"holy warrior\", and vowed to avenge him and other slain fighters. In an initial statement, the Pentagon-said it killed 14 members of al-Qaeda, but soon released a second statement admitting that the raid \"likely\" killed civilians as well. Nora, the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born Yemeni preacher who was killed in a 2011 drone attack, was among the victims, family members said. Her grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, a former minister of agriculture, said:-\"She was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours\".- He told reporters that she was visiting her mother when the raid took place.

Al-Qaeda has-exploited Yemen\\\\\\'s two-year-civil war that pits Shia Houthi fighters against the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and has carried out assassinations and bombings, mostly in areas across the south. The US has stepped up its use of drone strikes in recent years and, while it acknowledges some of them, it generally declines to comment on specific attacks. Source:-Al Jazeera News\\'\\n \\'Israel has passed a controversial bill that retroactively legalises thousands of settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, drawing widespread anger by Palestinian leaders and rights groups. The Israeli Knesset voted 60 to 52 to approve the contentious bill late on Monday- despite warnings by the government\\\\\\'s top lawyer who had previously called it \"unconstitutional\". Minutes after the vote, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) slammed the new law as a means to \"legalise theft\" of Palestinian land. The law demonstrated \"the Israeli government\\\\\\'s will to destroy any chances for a political solution,\" the PLO said in a statement, stressing that the \"Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the two-state solution\". The so-called \"Regulation Bill\" applies to about 4,000 settlement homes in the West Bank for which settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned land and had received encouragement from the Israeli state to do so. The bill is seen as another step towards at least partial annexation of the West Bank, and could lead to a host of illegal settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land being legalised retroactively. Three Israeli NGOs - Peace Now, Yesh Din and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel - said they intend to petition the Supreme Court to cancel the law. \"This law will make theft an official Israeli policy by retroactively legalising illegal construction on private lands,\" said Anat Ben Nun, a spokesman for the -anti-settlement organisation-Peace Now. READ MORE: Israel\\\\\\'s settlement bill \\\\\\'big step towards annexation\\\\\\' International law considers all settlements to be illegal, but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not, dubbed outposts. The bill was a key demand for parts of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\\\\\'s right-wing cabinet, including the hardline Jewish Home party, which argues that-settlers would be able to live without fear of being driven from their homes - many of which they have lived in for years.  The government\\\\\\'s attorney general, however, has said that the bill was unconstitutional and would contradict Israel\\\\\\'s legal obligations under international law. Israeli MK Tzipi Livni warned that it would lead Israeli soldiers to the International Criminal Court. The bill would apply to 53 other outposts and homes within existing settlements recognised by Israel built on Palestinian land, according to Peace Now. More than 3,800 homes would be \"legalised\", the NGO said. READ MORE: Palestinians decry Israel\\\\\\'s settlement bill The parliamentary session before the final readings began on Monday afternoon but was adjourned a short while later after all opposition members withdrew their reservations. Dov Khenin of the Arab Joint List said the opposition would not cooperate with the bill\\\\\\'s legislative process, accusing its proponents of acting counter to regulations. Though passed, the bill could still be challenged. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week: \"The chance that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court is 100 percent.\" Al Jazeera\\\\\\'s Imran Khan, reporting from West Jerusalem, said -the Palestinian land owners could take their case to the Supreme Court as early as Tuesday. \"The Palestinian Authority says it has to see what happens next, and [will decide] whether they have to go to the ICC or the UN,\" he added. Last week, a few hundred residents of the Amona outpost in the West Bank were evicted after the Supreme Court ruled that their homes were built on private Palestinian land. In parliament on Monday, Shuli Mualem, of Jewish Home, dedicated the law to the people evicted from Amona. The lengthy Amona saga - including the evictions broadcast live on Israeli television - directly inspired the bill.  Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations envoy for the Middle East peace process,-said on Monday that he was \"concerned\" by the recent bill as it would \"enable the continued use of privately owned Palestinian land for Israeli settlements\". \"If adopted into law, it will have far-reaching legal consequences for Israel and greatly diminish the prospects for Arab-Israeli peace,\" he added. Bezalel Smotrich, of the Jewish Home party, who was one of the forces behind the legislation, thanked the American people for electing Donald Trump as president, \"without whom the law would have probably not passed\". The White House\\\\\\'s immediate response was to refer to its statement last week that said the construction of new settlements \"may not be helpful\" in achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. The state department later said: \"The Trump administration will withhold comment on the legislation until the relevant court ruling.\" Since Trump\\\\\\'s inauguration, Israel has announced more than 6,000 new homes in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, seen as key parts of any future Palestinian state. While Trump\\\\\\'s administration last week expressed reservations over Israel\\\\\\'s settlement expansion, it also broke with previous administrations by saying settlements were not an obstacle to peace. \"President Trump hasn\\\\\\'t been as strong on condemnation of settlements as previous US administrations,\" Al Jazeera\\\\\\'s Khan said.- \"With this bill, Netanyahu is playing to his domestic audience ... supporters have been pushing him to go even further. He can simply turn around and say, \\\\\\'I tried my hardest\\\\\\'.\" Under the bill, Palestinian owners would be financially compensated by Israel, but could not sell their land.

In 2011, what became known as the \" Arab Spring \" revolts toppled Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . That March, peaceful protests erupted in Syria as well, after 15 boys were detained and tortured for having written graffiti in support of the Arab Spring. One of the boys, 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb , was killed after having been brutally tortured. The Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, responded to the protests by killing hundreds of demonstrators and imprisoning many more. In July 2011, defectors from the military announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group aiming to overthrow the government, and Syria began to slide into civil war. Initially, lack of freedoms and economic woes fuelled resentment of the Syrian government, and public anger was inflamed by the harsh crackdown on protesters. Successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt energised and gave hope to Syrian pro-democracy activists. Many Islamist movements were also strongly opposed to the Assads\\\\\\' rule. In 1982, Bashar al-Assad\\\\\\'s father, Hafez, ordered a military crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama, which killed between 10,000-40,000 people and flattened much of the city.  Even global warming has been claimed to have played a role in sparking the 2011 uprising. A severe drought plagued Syria from 2007-10, spurring as many as 1.5 million people to migrate from the countryside into cities, which exacerbated poverty and social unrest. Although the initial protests were mostly non-sectarian, armed conflict led to the emergence of starker sectarian divisions. Minority religious groups tend to support the Assad government, while the overwhelming majority of opposition fighters are Sunni Muslims. Although most Syrians are Sunni Muslims, Syria\\\\\\'s security establishment has long been dominated by members of the Alawite sect, of which Assad is a member. The sectarian split is reflected among regional actors\\\\\\' stances as well. The governments of majority-Shia Iran and Iraq support Assad, as does Lebanon-based Hezbollah ; while Sunni-majority states including Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others staunchly support the rebels. Foreign backing and open intervention have played a large role in Syria\\\\\\'s civil war. An international coalition led by the United States has bombed-targets of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group since 2014. In September 2015, Russia launched a bombing campaign against what it referred to as \"terrorist groups\" in Syria, which included ISIL, as well as rebel groups backed by western states. Russia has also deployed military advisers to shore up Assad\\\\\\'s defences. Several Arab states, along with Turkey, have provided weapons and materiel to rebel groups in Syria . Many of those fighting come from outside Syria. The ranks of ISIL include a sizeable number of fighters from around the world. Lebanese members of Hezbollah are fighting on the side of Assad, as are Iranian and Afghan fighters . Although the US has stated its opposition to the Assad government, it has hesitated to involve itself deeply in the conflict, even after the Assad government allegedly used chemical weapons in 2013, which US President Barack Obama had previously referred to as a \"red line\" that would prompt intervention. In October 2015, the US scrapped its controversial programme to train Syrian rebels, after it was revealed that it had spent $500m but only trained 60 fighters.  On November 26, the Syrian army launched a military offensive on Aleppo . In less than a month, Syrian troops, with unfettered Russian air support, were able to recapture 90 percent of the eastern part of Aleppo. On December 13, the Syrian army claimed that 98 percent of east Aleppo was in the hands of Syrian government forces. Besides, Aleppo, the Syrian government currently controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria and Deir Az Zor, much of the area near the Syrian-Lebanese border, and the northwestern coastal region. Rebel groups, ISIL, and Kurdish forces control the rest of the country. Rebel groups continue to jockey against one another for power, and frequently fight each other. The Free Syrian Army has weakened as the war has progressed, while explicitly Islamist groups, such as the al-Nusra Front, that- has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda , became empowered. Last July, al-Nusra front leader,-Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, announced his group\\\\\\'s name has also changed to Jabhat Fateh al Sham, or The Front for liberation of al Sham. In 2013, ISIL- emerged in northern and eastern Syria after overrunning large portions of Iraq. The group quickly gained international notoriety for its brutal executions and its energetic use of social media. Meanwhile, Kurdish groups in northern Syria are seeking self-rule in areas under their control. This has alarmed Turkey\\\\\\'s government, which fears its large native Kurdish population may grow more restive and demand greater autonomy as a result. Last August, Turkish troops and special forces, backed by the Free Syria Army, launched operation \"Euphrates Shield\" against ISIL to liberate the strategic Syrian city of Jarablus on the border with Turkey. Euphrates Shield operation is considered to be the first Turkish ground intervention in Syria since the Syrian crisis started in 2011. WATCH:- Unseen footage takes us into the lives of Syrian rebels. The Syrian war is creating profound effects far beyond the country\\\\\\'s borders. Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan are now housing large and growing numbers of Syrian refugees, many of whom have attempted to journey onwards to Europe in search of better conditions. Fighting has occasionally spilled over from Syria into Lebanon, contributing to the country\\\\\\'s political polarisation. Several rounds of peace talks have failed to stop the fighting.- But with much of the country in ruins , millions of Syrians having fled abroad, and a population deeply traumatised by war, one thing is certain: Rebuilding Syria after the war ends will be a lengthy, extremely difficult process.

Perhaps the timing of his ministerial appointment is fortunate: The Brexit referendum made Murphy realize Ireland could become the new gateway into the European market for Chinese firms, and lost no time in promoting this message. \"With so much uncertainty in the world at the moment, we see ourselves as a rock of certainty and stability,\" says Murphy. Citing Chinese President Xi Jinping\\\\\\'s recent speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on the benefits of globalization and free trade, Murphy stresses that Ireland\\\\\\'s openness to foreign investment fits exactly into those values. \"We have a pro-business government, we want companies to come in and make investments to create jobs.\"    Those words bear great similarities to the \\\\\\'open for business\\\\\\' message that Britain\\\\\\'s former prime minister David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne used to strengthen Chinese ties during their time in government. But with Cameron and Osborne having left office after the 2016 referendum vote, hints of the new British government, led by Theresa May, somewhat reducing its level of openness emerged when May announced new legal guidelines to closely scrutinize foreign investment in national security-related infrastructure. Within this context, perhaps Murphy\\\\\\'s message chimes more pleasantly with China. For Murphy, strengthening Chinese relations is not empty rhetoric, as Brexit uncertainties have sent a warning to Ireland about overreliance on the UK as a trade partner, and Murphy sees China as an assuring partner in its work to diversify and balance trade. \"We\\\\\\'ve had a close relationship with the UK. Slowly over time we\\\\\\'ve exported to new markets and found new opportunities, and this process is happening more quickly because of Brexit.\" For instance, the sudden devaluation of the pound was a \"dramatic\" consequence of Brexit-related uncertainties already felt by Irish exporters. \"President Xi spoke about commitment to globalization and countries working together to improve the benefits of globalization for their citizens. I suppose this leads to greater ambition for Chinese firms overseas, and that increases opportunities for a country such as Ireland, which has a global outlook.\" He stresses Ireland\\\\\\'s unique advantage as the only English-speaking country in the European Union post-Brexit, its common-law legal system\\\\\\'s similarity to the UK\\\\\\'s legal framework, and its government\\\\\\'s open-for-business attitude, all of which are factors making Dublin attractive for Chinese firms who once went big on UK investment as a means of European expansion, but who are now adopting a wait-and-see attitude while Britain negotiates its exit terms. In addition to attracting Chinese investment into Dublin, Murphy also holds a vision for Dublin to engage with China through the Belt and Road Initiative, financial technology cooperation and educational exchange. The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by President Xi Jinping three years ago to strengthen Asian European trade links through infrastructure investment, has gained momentum, receiving support from more than 100 countries and international organizations, more than 40 of which have signed cooperation agreements with China. In May, Murphy will visit Beijing for the China-led Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, where he will explore possibilities for Ireland\\\\\\'s further participation. In addition, Murphy is eagerly waiting for the AIIB\\\\\\'s approval for Ireland\\\\\\'s membership, which would enable Ireland help fund infrastructure projects in Belt and Road countries and share its own infrastructure development lessons with the AIIB. \"I think the AIIB plays an important role for countries that need infrastructure investment to increase the capacity and scope of their economies, we want to bring our knowledge to use in the AIIB whenever we can.\" He stresses that Ireland\\\\\\'s engagement with AIIB is not entirely centered on self interest, and that the potential financial gains are less important than the geopolitical gains. \"There may not be returns for the Irish state in terms of financial returns, but there\\\\\\'ll certainly be a return for helping other economies to increase their scope and improve the standards of living for their people\". Murphy praises the AIIB\\\\\\'s operating model, explaining it achieves efficiency, quick delivery speeds while maintaining low operating costs. Murphy says the infrastructure funding AIIB helps to channel into developing countries is crucial at a time when the global economy is searching for new sources of growth. He says: \"It\\\\\\'s going to be a whole new source of funding in parts of the world that may not necessarily have the resources. The AIIB has come along at an important time to make sure that type of funding can continue and that model can continue.\" As a country that has also developed on the back of heavy infrastructure development, Ireland has experience to share with the AIIB, such as lessons in public-private partnership investment, Murphy says. Public-private partnerships, in which initial government investment helps to reduce the risk of the private sector\\\\\\'s investment, attract a great deal of private-sector investment and are also at the core of AIIB\\\\\\'s philosophy. In addition, Murphy sees great opportunities in broader Irish-Chinese fintech collaboration, explaining that Ireland\\\\\\'s system of fintech innovation and supply chain could be the fertile soil where Chinese fintech firms strengthen their products and solutions. Education is an additional area in which Murphy hopes to further Irish-Chinese collaboration, not least because he personally developed an interest in China through teaching Chinese students English during his university days. In the early 2000s, Murphy taught English as a foreign language to Chinese and other Asian immigrants to Ireland at the Able Academy in Dublin and developed valuable friendships with his Chinese students, whom he describes as \"especially committed to family, culture and creativity\". \"It was very much interaction outside the classroom that allowed me to understand the Chinese people. They\\\\\\'d always invite me to cultural festivals - films, dance, music. On occasion, we\\\\\\'d all go out as a group and have food and drink and spend time together, and that\\\\\\'s how I got a sense of the importance of family in Chinese culture.\" Those fond memories and precious friendships prompted Murphy to take up Mandarin lessons when he attended King\\\\\\'s College London studying for his master\\\\\\'s degree, although he admits to finding it difficult. \"I quickly failed at Mandarin. It was very difficult for me. There\\\\\\'s the language, the writing, the tonal aspects. I was trying to continue my relationship with China through language, but wasn\\\\\\'t able to keep it up.\" Despite not learning Mandarin, Murphy has today found not just one but many ways to continue his relationship with China, including encouraging educational exchanges between Irish and Chinese universities. He says: \"From my visits to the country, I have realized China places a strong emphasis on education. We do as well. We are constantly trying to think of different courses that suit people, help them up-skill, and that\\\\\\'s the approach China is taking.\" cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page32)\\'\\n \\'Firm developing submersible and maritime nuclear power plant to plumb the depths China has begun to upgrade the design of its first-ever floating nuclear demonstration platform and has nearly finished building a new manned submersible capable of reaching the majority of seabeds in the world, says China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, the primary contractor for the country\\\\\\'s navy. A floating nuclear platform is a maritime nuclear power station. The technology can be installed in vessels and provide a stable source of electricity to oil rigs or remote areas such as the South China Sea. It can also provide power to offshore engineering ships, desalination ships or projects. \"This technology can be applied in the development of nuclear-powered icebreakers, nuclear-powered research ships for the polar region and other high-power marine engineering projects in the long-term,\" says Wang Junli, a senior specialist at CSIC\\\\\\'s technology and information department. The construction of China\\\\\\'s first maritime nuclear power plant is scheduled to be completed by 2018, and it is due to be operational by 2019, according to information released last year by China National Nuclear Corp, CSIC\\\\\\'s partner in this project. Eager to enhance its earning ability, China National Nuclear Corp also signed a cooperation agreement with state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corp, a domestic rival of CSIC, to develop similar equipment last week. In another key project, Shao Kaiwen, deputy general manager of CSIC, says developing deep-sea manned submersibles for rough seas will be one of the group\\\\\\'s priorities in 2017, with the assembly work and shakedown tests for the vessel due to be completed by the end of this year. The project is dominated by the group\\\\\\'s 702 research institute that led the development of Jiaolong, China\\\\\\'s first manned deep-sea submersible, capable of diving to 7,062 meters deep in the ocean. While Jiaolong is able to carry out research and exploration missions of 99.8 percent of the world\\\\\\'s seabed areas, CSIC is now building a new manned submersible that can reach a depth of 4,500 meters. The vessel is now under final assembly and testing phase. The submersible will be equipped with five observation windows and three seats. Compared with Jiaolong, the new vessel boasts wider commercial usage and lower cost, according to CSIC. Meanwhile, a CSIC shipyard is building a mothership, with displacement of around 4,000 tons, for Jiaolong. The vessel is expected to be put into service in March 2019. \"We have also made breakthroughs in big-ticket projects such as the installation and operation of a high-efficiency liquefied natural gas gasifier engineering project, and a measurement system for nuclear reactors with a capacity in excess of 1 million kilowatts, as well as a number of electric propulsion products and chemical cells,\" says Shao. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn   - Workers try to put cables onto Jiaolong, China\\\\\\'s first manned deep-sea submersible, after the completion of a research program.

New targets in cutting excess capacity in major sectors such as steel and coal have been set this year, as unveiled at the annual sessions of provincial legislatures in January, they add. The local sessions, which review and approve government economic and social development blueprints, come ahead of the annual sessions of the national legislature and the top political advisory body in March.   - An employee works with steel at a mill of CITIC Heavy Industries in Luoyang, Henan province. Huang Zhengwei / For China Daily  After a reduction of 33 million tons in steel capacity last year, China\\\\\\'s northern Hebei province aims to further slash about 32 million tons in the current year, according to the provincial government work report earlier this month. \"2017 will be our toughest year in capacity reduction,\" says Governor Zhang Qingwei. \"No matter how difficult it is, we are determined to succeed,\" Zhang adds. Hebei produces a quarter of the country\\\\\\'s iron and steel. Yu Yong, chairman of Hesteel Group, the biggest steel company in Hebei, says properly cutting capacity will make room for restructuring and upgrading of the steel sector.    The company cut 3.2 million tons of iron and steel capacity last year and is targeting a reduction of 4.4 million tons in 2017, Yu adds. Coal-rich Shanxi and central Henan both set the targets of cutting 20 million tons of coal capacity this year. The two provinces each slashed 23 million last year. \"Coal overcapacity reduction should be achieved through market means,\" says Lou Yangsheng, governor of Shanxi, adding that mergers and reorganizations will be encouraged. Hubei says that it will close all its coal production firms in two years. Southwestern Guizhou province will slash 15 million tons of coal capacity by closing 120 coal mines this year. As part of the reform, local governments will also focus on handling poor-performing zombie companies. Eastern Zhejiang province plans to close 300 zombie companies and 1,000 firms with outdated capacity this year. Southern Guangdong province aims to close 74 private zombie firms after it closed more than 2,000 state-owned zombie companies and 39 private companies in 2016. China achieved its 2016 target of cutting 45 million tons of steel and 250 million tons of coal production capacity, affecting nearly 800,000 workers.    This year, the tasks will be heavier, and zombie companies will be focused on, according to Xu Shaoshi, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country\\\\\\'s top economic planner. So far, 27 provinces have unveiled growth rates for last year and their targets for 2017 at local annual legislative sessions. Among them, 23 had growth rates higher than the national 6.7 percent, with Guizhou, Chongqing and Tibet all above 10 percent. Beijing and Shanghai both reported 6.7 percent. Most of the provinces aim to maintain the same or slightly lower growth than in 2016. With an estimated growth of 4.5 percent in 2016, lower than most other provinces, Shanxi set its GDP growth target at 5.5 percent this year to leave flexibility for transformation and reform. Other reforms, such as market-oriented debt-for-equity swaps and administrative streamlining, are being emphasized by many provinces to reduce corporate leverage and encourage businesses. Besides structural reform in industry, officials says China will also emphasize reform in agriculture this year.

The scheme is a result of negotiations among coal, steel and power industrial associations. It is a sound system that caters to the interests of producers and consumers in the market,\" says Jiang Zhimin, president of the China National Coal Association. Last week, the National Development and Reform Commission released a notice on preventing severe coal price fluctuations in 2017, establishing specific benchmark prices for the mid-and long-term contracts between coal companies, power companies and steel smelters. The commission has formulated three price spectrums: green (500-570 yuan per ton, or $73-83 per ton; 49-56 euros; 43-49), blue (570-600 or 470-500 yuan per ton) and red (above 600 or below 470 yuan per ton). In the green region, there will be no adjustment measures. In the blue region, the government will enhance market supervision and offer guiding measures when deemed appropriate. In the red region, the government will launch the contingency plan for the adjustment of abnormal prices. \"Generally speaking, coal prices of 500 to 700 yuan per ton are acceptable for most coal companies and downstream industries. Below 470 yuan per ton, the coal industry will suffer across-the-board losses,\" says Jiang. The power coal price was around 639 yuan per ton at the end of last year, up 72.7 percent from the beginning of 2016. Jiang does not offer any prediction about the capacity reduction goal this year, saying that it\\\\\\'s being discussed and will be released by the State Council after the Spring Festival holiday. The actual capacity reduction last year was around 300 million tons, compared with the goal of 250 million tons. The capacity is increasingly concentrating in large companies. The number of coal mines has gone down from 24,800 in 2005 to the current 9,000. yangziman@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page25)\\'\\n \\'Policies will likely center around attraction and retention of investment in uncertain times China\\\\\\'s policymakers must make greater efforts to stabilize investor confidence as the country is facing the pressure of a slowdown in housing investments this year, economists said. \"Our advice for policymakers is to reduce business taxes and fees, shore up the weak spots of the economy, close \\\\\\'zombie enterprises\\\\\\' and break the monopolies of State-owned enterprises,\" says Qu Hongbin, co-head of Asian economic research and chief economist for Greater China at HSBC Holdings PLC. \"This will help stabilize the confidence of private companies and prevent private investments from declining further. It will hedge against the risk of a drop in real estate investments and ease the pressure of capital outflows,\" says Qu at a media briefing in Beijing.   - China\\\\\\'s first Skytrain is readied for trial operations in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Lyu Jia / For China Daily  He suggested the government should boost investments in metros and urban underground utilities and take measures to fight against air pollution. China could also encourage companies to increase their environmentally-friendly investments by upgrading equipment to meet higher emissions standards. It is important for the central government to continue streamlining its administration, delegating power to lower levels and reducing bias against privately owned enterprises in regard to market entry. This will help stabilize the economy in the short term and optimize China\\\\\\'s economic structure in the medium and long run, he said. Zhao Yang, economist at Nomura International (Hong Kong) Limited, agreed with Qu, saying that he expects the government to launch a more active fiscal policy to accelerate infrastructure investments related to environmental protection, urban transportation, underground pipeline networks and high-speed rails. Liu Ligang, chief China economist at Citigroup Inc, said Citi forecasts that the Chinese economy will grow by 6.5 percent in 2017, if infrastructure investments maintain a growth rate of about 20 percent, and if the growth of consumption and foreign trade remain the same as last year. \"We believe China\\\\\\'s policy priority will be economic stability over structural reform in 2017. Leading into late 2017, a \\\\\\'steady boat\\\\\\' measure in economic policy is likely to be adopted to minimize economic uncertainty. This means the 2016 policy framework could be strengthened this year, with fiscal policy leading the way to achieve a 6.5 to 7 percent growth target,\" Liu says. State-owned enterprise reform saw modest progress in the second half of 2016. Looking ahead, he says the ongoing corporatization of SOEs will continue. However, as a result of the \"steady boat\" approach to economic policy this year, SOE ownership reform - the more decisive part of the reform - may have to wait until 2018. Externally, US President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s policies may mean more trade frictions between China and the US, but Liu and other Citigroup economists believe the political and economic stakes are simply too high for the largest and second-largest economies of the world to engage in a trade war. \"Trump\\\\\\'s threats on China\\\\\\'s currency and trade could mean Beijing will need to sit down and negotiate seriously with the US on market access and protecting intellectual property rights. In some areas, if interests are aligned, these dynamics could also help accelerate China\\\\\\'s reform process,\" he says. jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn   - Maintenance technicians conduct checks on the maglev train before it enters trial operations in Changsha, Hunan province.

But last year it lagged, according to the latest official statistics released in Beijing on Jan 20. Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that in 2016, domestic consumption contributed 64.6 percent to growth in GDP, dipping 1.8 percentage points from a year ago. From 2012 to 2014, consumption contributed around 50 percent to GDP growth, and the rising ratio has indicated a solid growth in consumer spending and improvement in industrial structures, analysts say. \"The consumption sector has been a strong area of the Chinese economy, which has been dragged down by slowing exports and investments,\" says Zhao Ping, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, under the Ministry of Commerce. Currently, China is pushing to stimulate growth by focusing on supply-side reform, which aims to cut low-end industrial capacity, increase high-tech production, encourage online shopping and stimulate the service sector.

They can\\\\\\'t debate the evidence presented so they try to make it seem as you made a blanket sstatement. The Scientist say \"PROBABLY\" right there on the updated comments on their published paper. Here\\\\\\'s what they said: But they make clear that further work will need to be done to confirm or deny that hypothesis. That will need to be done by watching for the same signals on different equipment so that all other explanations can be discarded. Again, NOBODY SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY. I hate it when people do that. This is why I always ask people to quote me where I said this or that because when people can\\\\\\'t debate the evidence they try to debate against things that were never said. They also said this: ALL natural explanations need to be exhausted BEFORE Extraterrestrials are invoked as a possible explanation. WHAT!!! That makes no sense. This standard would make it almost impossible to find an Extraterrestrial signal. In most cases ALL natural explanations will never be exhausted so we will have to talk about these things in terms of probability and what\\\\\\'s most likely and least likely at least at first. Look, it\\\\\\'s easy to cherry pick after the fact. Like I said, an earlier study about the search for Extraterrestrials PREDICTED that we would see these signals and that would be evidence to support the hypothesis. That\\\\\\'s just Science. If you look at the sentence, it says BEFORE you can even invoke Extraterrestrials as a possible explanation. Again, that\\\\\\'s absurd. Extraterrestrial existence needs to be looked at as a possible explanation based on the observed evidence not an extraordinary claim. edit on 26-10-2016 by neoholographic because: (no reason given)\\'\\n \\'Anticipation of the regulator\\\\\\'s acceleration of new share sale approvals as well as the push for financial deleveraging could be a source of pressure on the Chinese stock market in the coming weeks, analysts say. There have been signs that the Chinese regulator wants to accelerate the approval of initial public offerings this year as pressure in the IPO pipeline has been mounting, with more than 700 companies queueing to issue new shares. In the past two weeks alone, the regulator has approved 24 IPOs, more than doubling the number of deals of the same period in 2016. \"This is a signal that the regulator is speeding up the approval of IPOs, which could weigh on the current market price,\" says Li Yuebo, an analyst with Industrial Securities Co Ltd. The China International Capital Corp estimated that the regulator will likely approve about 500 IPOs this year, raising roughly 300 billion yuan ($43.8 billion; 29.6 billion euros; 26.2 billion). The State-run Xinhua News Agency last week quoted experts as saying that China\\\\\\'s \"normalization\" of IPOs could help raise the financing efficiency of companies and direct more capital into the real economy. The report made the market more volatile, as investors worried that more IPOs could drain market liquidity and push down stock prices. The securities regulator also said on Jan 20 that it will adopt new measures to curb frequent refinancing deals by listed companies or a single deal that raises an excess amount of capital. The regulatory move could help channel more capital into the IPO market.    Lu Xiaofeng, analyst with BOC International Co Ltd, says that the overall market will maintain the trend of consolidation ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday as factors, including the acceleration of IPOs, will lead to a reduced risk appetite among investors. Meanwhile, Gao Ting, head of China strategy at UBS Securities, says the Chinese government\\\\\\'s effort to push for financial deleveraging will likely continue, which could be a source of pressure on the markets in the coming months. In addition, 52 percent of investors surveyed by UBS identified depreciation of the renminbi and capital outflows as the biggest risks for the A-share market this year, followed by economic weakness driven by another property slowdown (32 percent) and spillover of bond market volatility into stocks (16 percent). Nonetheless, the majority of investors polled by UBS are optimistic on Chinese stocks, with 86 percent expecting the MSCI China Index to strengthen in the next 12 months, and over 50 percent expecting at least a 5 percent increase. \"Nearly 80 percent of investors said they believe the rally in cyclical sectors will continue this year, as supply-side reform deepens and demand recovers,\" Gao says. lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page28)\\'\\n \\'China\\\\\\'s hunger for natural gas has pushed CIMC Enric Holding Ltd, one of the country\\\\\\'s biggest liquefied natural gas equipment manufacturers by sales revenue, to upgrade its products. Its newly-designed, high-performance, large-capacity LNG tankers are expected to redefine oceanic transport of natural gas. \"Once this mode of transportation is launched and widely accepted, a lot of wasted offshore natural gas will be saved,\" said Yang Baoying, deputy general manager at CIMC Enric. The new 40-foot (12.2 meter) containers passed security tests in the United States recently. Each of them can enable LNG imports in small batches, and successfully implement the LNG one-tank, multimodal transport on road, rail and water. They could also raise standards for LNG logistics in the global market. CIMC Enric also completed a sea trial for a 14,000-cubic-meter LNG carrier in November 2016. This is one of 20 LNG feeder vessels available in the world. The added value and technical content of LNG carriers are more advanced than those of oil tankers, and they will be equipped with tanks that can resist extremely low temperatures. The company produced the world\\\\\\'s first CNG transport ship capable of moving 700,000 cubic meters of CNG for its client in Tantong, Jiangsu province, in 2016.    Even though demand for LNG is depressed and under pressure, thrust on low carbon energy use will see LNG playing a key role in the optimization of the domestic energy structure, said Sun Hongli, another deputy general manager of CIMC Enric, a subsidiary of China International Marine Containers (Group) Ltd. Bao Zhangjing, director of the China Shipbuilding Industry Research Center, said: \"At present, most of the associated gas gained from offshore drilling projects is commonly burned as waste gas, including in China and other countries.\" The company\\\\\\'s product range includes storage tanks, LNG carriers, import terminals and export terminals. CIMC Enric specializes in the manufacture of equipment for energy, chemical and liquid food industries. Its equipment and engineering business covers both onshore compressed natural gas and its industrial chain, as well as the offshore LNG industrial chain. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page25)\\'\\n \\'- A man buys fireworks to be used to welcome the Lunar New Year.

It is profiting from keen interest shown by China\\\\\\'s rapidly-growing community of wealthy consumers. The British super sports brand experienced a stellar year in 2016 with a 99.3 percent increase in global sales to 3,286 cars. In China alone, McLaren sold 228 cars last year, a significant addition to the total of 300 it sold in its first three years in China.   - Mike Flewitt, chief executive officer of McLaren Automotive, feels confident about the company\\\\\\'s future in China. Provided to China Daily  It\\\\\\'s an achievement that is a little hard to believe given McLaren\\\\\\'s China office, in Shanghai, employs only 10 staff, who are mainly in charge of the sales, marketing, after-sales services and relationship management. The company works with a network of 14 Chinese retailers to distribute its cars. \"Affluent Chinese supercar customers appreciate the attributes of the McLaren car and our cars are well suited to this developing market,\" says Mike Flewitt, chief executive officer of McLaren Automotive. \"As a result, we are very confident about our prospects going forward.\" Recently, Flewitt spoke with China Daily about the luxury car maker\\\\\\'s strategy and business opportunities in China. The following are edited excerpts from the interview:    How would you describe your company\\\\\\'s prospects in China, given the current economic situation? At McLaren Automotive, we feel very confident about our future in China. We are a relatively new company and we sold our first car in China in September 2013, so went later into the market than most of our competitors. We have seen sales of a number of competitors decline. In contrast to that, in 2015, our sales grew by 56 percent compared with 2014. Awareness of the McLaren brand is developing well through a number of marketing activities, including motor shows and retailer activity. As a result, we are very confident about our prospects going forward. What has been your company\\\\\\'s biggest achievement in the mainland market? In my view, setting up a good retailer network in any market, especially a growing market like China, is vital to the success of any company and is one of our greatest achievements. We have worked hard in a very short period of time to find quality retail partners who can represent the McLaren brand well. We have 14 retailers across China and these retailers are growing sales dramatically. As a relatively new competitor in the marketplace, these retailers will be key in developing the awareness and consideration of McLaren in this rapidly developing marketplace and so their achievements will reflect our achievements. In your view, what is the secret of your business\\\\\\'s success in China? Very simply, understanding the needs, desires and expectations of our customers. Only in this way can we deliver products that meet those expectations. I and all of my executives frequently meet our customers face-to-face at company-organized events, as well as social gatherings, to listen and understand exactly what they think about us and want from us. What is an example of McLaren\\\\\\'s customer-centric approach in China? An example of this was attending the Beijing Autoshow. It was only the second time we had displayed cars in Beijing. We had an excellent presence at the show and we invited our retailers and customers to our stand to debut the new McLaren 570GT to Asian customers. While we were in Beijing, we also took the time to have a gala dinner with our affluent customers, to show them how grateful we were for their patronage but also to help us understand how we can improve what we do for them. We try and have these dinners and social gatherings wherever we are in the world, but it\\\\\\'s especially important in China because the landscape and culture changes so quickly. These meetings also help them understand more about who McLaren is, so it\\\\\\'s a mutually beneficial outcome. What essential leadership qualities do you consider important when leading your team to grow in the Chinese market? We have recruited very successful leaders in China. A very clear understanding of the local market requirements is vital, as well as the cultural sensitivities and differences between China and other parts of the world. In addition, as in other parts of the world, it\\\\\\'s key to understand how the affluent classes behave, spend their free time and so on. Only in this way can we hope to be talking to them in a way that they understand and appreciate, and build strong, long-term and trusting relationships with customers. How does your China market strategy fit in with your work in the Asia-Pacific region? China is part of our Asia-Pacific region and we have populated the leadership roles within that regional team with international people who understand the markets through experience with competitor brands, as well as Chinese employees who understand what Chinese buyers think and want. This balance of international experience and local knowledge has served us very well and has helped deliver the significant sales growth we are experiencing. How do you motivate your international team? Different people need different motivation. We are still a relatively new and small company so I know most of our employees personally. Whenever I travel abroad to events or meetings, if possible, I try to have a meeting or dinner with the local teams to get understanding and feedback from them on performance and how we can make their lives easier. In this way, everybody can feel that their ideas are being listened to and each and every one of them is inputting into the future of the company. In addition, we are fortunate to have a very motivational and passionate brand to work for, and the cars that we build are some of the most aspirational products in the world. All of our employees feel a tremendous sense of pride and motivation to be working for a globally recognized brand like McLaren. This combination makes working for McLaren a very motivational and enjoyable experience. What do you think about the Chinese Dream? What are the dreams you have for your company in China? As a young company, I have many dreams and aspirations that I would like our company to fulfill. Mainly, I would like us to ensure that our potential in this very dynamic and growing market is exceeded. We have started well and made some significant developments in a short period of time. What are McLaren\\\\\\'s long-term sales goals in China and globally? Globally, and in China, we have to remain focused on our objectives if our longer-term sales ambitions are going to be achieved. I am very confident that we build the best sports cars in the world but our brand has varying levels of awareness across the globe. In some markets, we have high levels of awareness thanks to an understanding created by our long-term participation in Formula One. But in markets where awareness of Formula One and wider motorsport is low, as a young company we have to develop that awareness. I\\\\\\'ve said this before but it\\\\\\'s a vital ingredient of our future success. Customer awareness of McLaren building the world\\\\\\'s best sports cars is how we will fulfill our potential. What are your hobbies? How do you spend your time outside of work when you are in China? As CEO of a young and dynamic company, I don\\\\\\'t have a huge amount of spare time. I try and get as close to as many of our customers as possible and this often entails traveling to, or attending events with, McLaren customers over the evenings and weekends. When I\\\\\\'m travelling in China, I\\\\\\'m keen to understand how we can improve what we do for them. When I am at home in the UK and have time, I am an avid motor racing fan, as you might expect doing the job I do and for a company like McLaren, and so I enjoy racing my own historic racing cars whenever I can. cecily@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page31)\\'\\n \\'on November 11, 2016 3:30 pm Â· \\\\nAs if the election of Donald Trump couldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s highest court. \\\\nAll year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. \\\\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nominees. I expect them to give Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t honor Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nominee, youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re making a huge mistake.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nDemocrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. \\\\nSince Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. Thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s far from the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfair shakeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. \\\\nPutting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against womenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfair shakesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s exactly what Democrats should do to Trump.

We advise them also on culture and ways of thinking in the market they are expanding into, so our role is more encompassing than, strictly speaking, the lawyer\\\\\\'s role,\" says Linda Yang, global partner and executive chairman of Yingke\\\\\\'s global board of directors. \"This is rewarding because we are able to participate in our clients\\\\\\' international expansion journey,\" she says.   Yingke international partners celebrate the 15th anniversary in 2016 in Beijing. The Chinese law firm is optimistic about doing more deals in the UK, which has become a popular destination for Chinese investors. Provided to China Daily  Yingke originally established a UK subsidiary in 2010, but its presence has significantly grown since it established an exclusive strategic partnership with London-based, mid-market corporate firm Memery Crystal in 2015. Its UK subsidiary, Yingke UK Consulting, is not a direct subsidiary of Yingke Law because Chinese law firms aren\\\\\\'t allowed to be shareholders of foreign entities, although the UK entity is directly controlled by the managing partner of Yingke Law. The two law firms have so far collaborated on half a dozen deals, ranging from property investment to cross border acquisitions in fields including football, software technology and industrial technology, although details of the deals are kept confidential. Most of those deals represent Chinese outbound investments originating from Yingke\\\\\\'s clients in China. The deals signed in the UK follow UK local law, with Memery Crystal playing a crucial part in seeing the deals through on the ground, as well as occasionally proposing local market acquisition targets if their existing UK clients are looking for investors.  Yang is optimistic about doing more deals in the UK, as her team has witnessed more interest from Chinese firms in acquiring UK targets after the June referendum vote when the UK voted to leave the European Union, leading to a depreciation of the pound. In recent years, the UK has become a popular destination for Chinese investors. According to a new study, released in November 2016 by Cass Business School, there were 91 Chinese cross-border M&A investments in the UK from January 2012 to June 2016. Popular sectors of these M&A activities include football, property, healthcare and high technology, says Yang. \"These deals allow Chinese investors to gain technology and expertise very fast, and allow them to quickly internationalize.\" Founded in Beijing in 2001, Yingke has quickly grown to become one of China\\\\\\'s most famous law firms. According to a league table released in September by The American Lawyer magazine, Yingke is China\\\\\\'s largest law firm by headcount and ranked sixth in China by 2015 revenue. Its 2015 revenue also represented a 38 percent year-on-year increase, according to The American Lawyer. Yingke signed a new partnership agreement with the UN Development Program in November focusing on South-South cooperation. The agreement made Yingke one of the five founders of the Global Coalition of Think Tank Networks for South-South Cooperation, focusing on risk management and research in law, regulations and policies. Yang says Yingke was selected by the UNDP mainly because of its global network. Yang says Yingke maintains an open corporate culture, meaning partners can \"express their own opinions and carry out services in ways they would prefer\".  Another unique characteristic of Yingke is the array of opportunities it offers young lawyers, as some of the firm\\\\\\'s young partners are only in their 30s. Yang says this youthful culture keeps the company vibrant. As an established firm in China, Yingke began its international expansion in 2010, championing a model of forming partnerships with law firms in each of the international jurisdictions it practices in. It refers its existing clients hoping to expand overseas to its partner firms abroad and, once a deal is done, revenue from the legal advice is shared between Yingke and its overseas partner. \"We think this way of expansion is more effective than sending our own teams of lawyers abroad because our partners\\\\\\' mature teams allow us to expand quicker globally as a law firm and also because law is such a regulated profession, lawyers need to understand local laws and regulations. We believe this type of partnership creates the best value for our clients,\" she says. Yang says Yingke\\\\\\'s grasp on cultural understanding is a big advantage in helping clients secure cross-border deals. \"Cultural differences can be a big setback for major international deals, but it only takes a little bit of effort to explain things to our clients and make sure they understand.\" She recalls one incident, when a Yingke client was setting up a joint venture with a Western partner. The Chinese CEO wanted to show his team\\\\\\'s interest and commitment so he made a casual remark as a gesture of friendship that the Chinese side will be the majority partner, but the Western firm insisted for this point to appear in the contract. The Chinese firm refused to include this point in a contract, believing it was only an unofficial friendly remark, so the deal was in jeopardy for a long time - that is, until Yingke stepped in to explain the cultural misunderstanding, that the Chinese firm made the comment only as a message of commitment, not in a legal sense. Examples of such cultural misunderstandings are plenty in Yang\\\\\\'s team\\\\\\'s daily work, she explains. For instance, Chinese people do not like saying no, so they often just say \\\\\\'sure\\\\\\' while listening to a point their Western partner makes, but this does not necessarily mean they agree. \"So it\\\\\\'s important to really understand what the Chinese company means when they say \\\\\\'sure\\\\\\'.\" On a more serious note, Yang says Yingke firmly believes Chinese companies should seek legal advice throughout the global expansion process, instead of relying on legal advice from their joint venture partners in an international market. She recalls a client who once expanded into Portugal initially without a legal advisor, and did not understand that all legally-binding decisions from board meetings in Portugal must be written in English and Portuguese. Its unreliable Portuguese joint venture partner took advantage of local law by translating all decisions favorable for the Portuguese side into Portuguese, leaving the decisions favorable for the Chinese side in English. The Chinese investor suffered a lot from these legal disadvantages, and in the end their Portuguese JV went bankrupt. Championing local market understanding with an extensive legal background, Yingke now has a global network covering more than 30 countries, including the UK, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Spain, Italy, Greece and Israel. In the UK, Yingke chose to partner with Memery Crystal due to similar corporate cultures. \"They are international-minded and inclusive, and keen to take on new challenges.\" Speaking about this open-minded attitude, Yang remembers when two partners from Memery Crystal visited Shanghai and asked her to take them to a local restaurant to try a famous Shanghai dish called \\\\\\'hairy crab\\\\\\' they had heard about. \"We were impressed by their willingness to try new things, so we took them to a restaurant. They tried to eat hairy crab actually, but it was very difficult to break the shell and eat it and they ended up making a mess. But we were impressed by their ability to try, as we know a lot of Westerners would just not bother at all.\" Memery Crystal CEO Nick Davis also speaks fondly about the Yingke partnership. \"Our two companies have a shared focus on serving clients and our teams share a similar outlook. Memery Crystal is a company which has a history of serving private entrepreneurs, so our corporate culture is very similar to Yingke\\\\\\'s,\" Davis says. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com ( China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page30)\\'\\n \\'Japan controls the chain and calls them the Senkaku Islands, while China calls them the Diaoyu Islands. The sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed America\\\\\\'s commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy. Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the disputed islands,-including face-offs between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces-that have been termed dangerous by both sides. EXPLAINER: How an uninhabited island chain split Japan and China China\\\\\\'s State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country\\\\\\'s Coast Guard, put out a statement late Monday saying the three ships \"cruised within China\\\\\\'s Diaoyu Islands territorial sea.\" China\\\\\\'s Defense Ministry, which is separate from the Oceanic Administration, posted a statement on its website confirming the Coast Guard ship movement. Japan\\\\\\'s Coast Guard said the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters. It was the fourth time Chinese ships have entered Japan\\\\\\'s waters this year, the Japanese Coast Guard said. There were 36 such incidents in 2016, it said. Despite the frequency of the Chinese sailings, experts said having one so soon after Mattis\\\\\\' visit to Japan sent a subtle message to both Tokyo and Washington. \"It is both a signal that China won\\\\\\'t be intimidated from defending its interests/claims and a test to see how the new (Trump) administration responds,\" said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\\\\\\'s Joint Intelligence Center. Denny Roy, an Asian security expert at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said ship movements in disputed waters could result in a shooting incident. \"The danger is especially high considering military personnel on both sides are often eager to demonstrate their determination to defend what they consider national territory,\" Roy said. And a China-Japan military confrontation could bring US forces into play. During a press conference Saturday in Tokyo, Mattis said the US would defend the islands with Japan. \"I made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands -- the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,\" Mattis said in an appearance with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. The US position was reinforced Tuesday in a phone call between Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from Japan\\\\\\'s Foreign Ministry. \"The United States will be against any unilateral action made to damage the Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands,\" Tillerson stated during the call, according to the Japanese statement. China responded quickly on Saturday to the US stance on the islands, saying it brings instability to the region. \"Diaoyu and its affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be changed. The so-called US-Japan security treaty was a product of the Cold War, and it should not harm China\\\\\\'s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. \"We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and stop making wrong remarks on the issue of the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands,\" Lu said. The US commitment to the Senkakus is not new. In 2014, the Obama administration also said the remote chain fell under the treaty. In late 2013, China-declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the East China Sea, including the Senkakus, despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. Japan also has an ADIZ over the islands. Although the Senkakus are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral and fishing rights in the surrounding waters. While the Senkakus remain a source of friction in the US-China relationship, Mattis\\\\\\' visit seemed to have soothed relations a bit in another area, the South China Sea. Although the US defense chief said \"China has shredded the trust of nations in the region\" by fortifying disputed South China Sea islands, Mattis also said no increased US military maneuvers there were needed. Lu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, on Monday welcomed that stance. \"As for Mattis\\\\\\' comment that there is no need for large-scale military operations in the area and the issue should be resolved through diplomacy, these remarks deserve our affirmation,\" Lu said.\\'\\n \\'Chinese investment in a natural gas project in the resource-rich Arctic region promises to be a game-changer later this year Amega overseas project for liquefied natural gas that will likely burnish China\\\\\\'s global profile, contribute to the country\\\\\\'s energy security, enhance its geopolitical strategy and bolster efforts for economic rejuvenation is scheduled to start production in the Russian Arctic late this year. The Yamal project - its corporate entity is called Oao Yamal LNG - is located in north-central Russia and is expected to produce 16.5 million metric tons per annum. In September 2013, China National Petroleum Corp, the country\\\\\\'s largest oil and gas producer by annual output, acting through its subsidiary, CNPC Russia, bought a 20 percent stake in Oao Novatek\\\\\\'s $27-billion (25 billion euros; 21.6 billion) Yamal project for $5.4 billion.    Oao Novatek holds a 50.1 percent stake in the Yamal project, while Total holds 20 percent and the Silk Road Fund, 9.9 percent. Novatek is Russia\\\\\\'s independent natural gas producer and the country\\\\\\'s second-biggest LNG company after state-owned Gazprom. China\\\\\\'s investment will help the Russian gas supplier to complete the project, one of the largest industrial undertakings in the Russian Arctic. The new gas production center evolving in the Yamal Peninsula is expected to transform the Russian gas industry. It is also expected to boost China\\\\\\'s oil and gas reserves substantially, ensuring a steady, long-term supply. Much of Yamal\\\\\\'s output would be supplied to China and other Asian countries, according to Novatek. CNPC pledged to buy at least 3 million tons of LNG per year, said analysts. According to Wang Lu, an Asia-Pacific oil and gas analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, imports from Yamal may account for more than 1.6 percent of China\\\\\\'s gas demand, which is estimated to be 257 billion cubic meters in 2018, assuming a 10 percent compound annual growth rate during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). \"China\\\\\\'s LNG imports will continue to be an important contributor to its supply landscape in 2020,\" she says. \"The project\\\\\\'s success and reliability will enhance CNPC\\\\\\'s investment return, so this aligns CNPC\\\\\\'s interests with Novatek\\\\\\'s.\" For CNPC, Yamal has strategic importance. It expects the project to foster greater cooperation between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, give a fillip to economic development and scientific research, and shape regional rules and norms relating to gas reserves in the region. Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a consulting company that provides analysis of China\\\\\\'s energy market, says the country had arranged for the steady import of natural gas from Russia even before the Yamal investment. Russia\\\\\\'s Gazprom has a 30-year contract with China to supply 38 billion cu m of natural gas annually beginning in 2018. CNPC\\\\\\'s participation in Yamal is part of Chinese companies\\\\\\' global strategy and signifies the country\\\\\\'s intent to be a key player in the crucial Arctic region. In the process, China will have also helped Russia with its shortage due to sanctions imposed by the US and Europe over the annexation of Crimea. The deal represents a significant step in Russian President Vladimir Putin\\\\\\'s push to boost commercial ties with China. China\\\\\\'s backing will ensure the project will roll, says an official from CNPC Russia. Elaborating, he says sanctions had rendered financing for the project in US dollars impossible. Several US and European banks have pulled out of financing deals, leaving a void to be filled with China\\\\\\'s capital, technology and massive markets. According to Evgeniy Kot, director-general of the Yamal project, the company has sold 96 percent of the project\\\\\\'s LNG production to European and Asian customers through 20- to 25-year contracts. Benefiting from the vast natural gas reserves across the Yamal Peninsula, the company signed loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank Corp for 1.2 billion yuan ($173 million; 161 million euros; 138 million ) in all. For its part, Russia will provide tax incentives to companies involved in the development of the Arctic region, including zero export duty on LNG and special tariffs for condensate oil. CNPC Russia said it is confident Novatek\\\\\\'s rich experience in operating in Arctic weather conditions will help the Yamal project. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page27)\\'\\n \\'Nobel-winning economist Robert Engle suggests improvements to capital allocation for fast-growing SMEs American economist Robert Engle gave Chinese officials some ideas on how to make China\\\\\\'s financial sector more efficient. Engle, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in economics, along with British economist Clive Granger, was invited to Beijing last week by the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs to give his suggestions on risk management in China\\\\\\'s capital market because of his expertise in studying volatility. Financial institutions should be subjected to regular stress tests to see if they remain solvent enough in the face of an economic downturn. The results of such tests should be published publicly and become benchmarks for the performance of banks so that they do a more effective job of choosing where the loans go, he says.   - Robert Engle, Nobel laureate, makes a speech at an economic forum in Nankai University in Tianjin in October 2016. Photos Provided to China Daily   - Engle and his wife Mary attend the forum at Nankai University, where he is an honorary professor.   \"I think that many more benefits will come from improving allocation of capital to the fast-growing SMEs, which are also job creators,\" says Engle, 75. He and Granger are recognized for developing the groundbreaking statistical model, called the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, designed to analyze unpredictable movements in market prices and interest rates. The method can also measure systematic risks in financial markets, especially on a short-term basis. \"If you try to predict a year in the future, it\\\\\\'s very complicated. If it\\\\\\'s a day in the future, that\\\\\\'s not so hard,\" he explains. \"If we talk about risk management for financial applications, maybe short-horizon predictions are enough.\" Engle earned a master\\\\\\'s degree in physics before he went on to acquire a PhD in economics from Cornell University in 1969. \"I decided that I wanted to work on something that more than 10 people in the world will understand,\" he says of the reason behind changing streams in academics. While studying economics was at first a \"slow and painful process\", Engle believes his background in physics and statistics eventually helped him stand out as an economist. \"Because in physics we do experiments to measure some complicated things and figure out what they really mean. That\\\\\\'s the same way we do economic analysis,\" he says. A longtime professor of economics, Engle now teaches at New York University\\\\\\'s Stern School of Business, where he is the Michael Armellino professor of financial services management. Engle paid his first visit to China in 1985, when he was invited to teach an econometrics course at Renmin University of China in Beijing. During the six-week program, which was sponsored by the Ford Foundation and China\\\\\\'s Ministry of Education, Engle and two other American teachers taught students from different parts of the country. Chinese students were rather quiet back then, and he did all sorts of things, including giving them small souvenirs, to get them to talk. As part of the trip, Engle toured Shanghai, Guilin and Chengdu and visited many tourist sites in the cities. \"China has changed so dramatically in 30 years. That\\\\\\'s extraordinary.\" People in Beijing were still wearing old-style blue outfits in the 1980s, and there were very few cars and everybody was riding a bicycle. It was also hard to find people who spoke English, and he had to get somebody to write down in Chinese the name of his hotel so that he could tell a taxi driver to take him back, Engle says. \"If they (Chinese authorities) can figure out what\\\\\\'s the right thing to do, they\\\\\\'ll do it. And they\\\\\\'ve been very good at that,\" he adds. Engle, who is on an advisory board of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, comes to China more often these days, attending conferences and giving talks. In 2014, Engle launched a Shanghai branch of the Volatility Institute of the Stern School of Business as part of a New York University initiative there. He is director of the institute. NYU Shanghai, which was established by New York University and East China Normal University, is the first Sino-US university campus. Operated in close partnership with the Stern School and applying tools such as an award-winning model to analyze data, the Volatility Institute at NYU Shanghai provides financial information and analysis of the markets on its website for economists, regulators and even the general public. The Shanghai institute has cooperated with the stock exchange and universities in the southern metropolis, and has also started an annual conference series that brings experts to discuss China\\\\\\'s financial system, Engle says. Despite his busy schedule as a high-profile economist and a regular teaching schedule, Engle tries to stick to hobbies like figure skating and dancing. But whenever he gets a chance to relax, he finds a lot of questions running through his mind. \"I always look for simple answers,\" says Engle, who rewards himself with simple pleasures like a cup of coffee every time he figures out an answer. liuxiangrui@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page21)\\'\\n \\'Apple gets Chinese artists to present traditional themes in a modern way for Spring Festival As Spring Festival approaches each year, Chinese households follow the custom of hanging paintings - usually colored woodblock prints - on their doors and walls to welcome the new year. However, the tradition has changed a little in the digital age. One such painting now appears on gadgets\\\\\\' screens, with the swords of door gods replaced by karaoke microphones. One of the door gods holds a camera and a bird\\\\\\'s cage, and behind him are skyscrapers and fancy cars.   - Above and bottom: Chinese New Year pictures take on a modern look in the creations by young Chinese artists. Photos Provided to China Daily  The peace-themed Chinese Lunar New Year painting, created by Beijing-based artist Ye Hongxing, was first designed on a computer and then turned into a physical work of art - a mosaic of tens of thousands of stickers. \"I combined modern and traditional elements to make it interesting. They can be downloaded as wallpapers on phones and computers,\" says Ye. She is one of the five artists invited by US tech giant Apple Inc to make paintings focusing on reunion, fortune, peace and harvest - traditional themes of Chinese woodblock prints for Spring Festival paintings that date back hundreds of years. Unlike Ye, whose paintings have both electronic and printed versions, the other four artists\\\\\\' works are only online. But pictures by all five artists are shown on screens at subway stops and on skyscrapers, and countless phone screens to celebrate the Year of the Rooster. \"New Year pictures are used to convey people\\\\\\'s good wishes for the coming year. They often feature fish to herald good fortune and door gods to signal peace and safety,\" says Ye.    The 45-year-old was born in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Her family would hang pictures of door gods and New Year paintings on the walls when she was a child. Apart from those heralding good fortune, some traditional works were created based on stories from Peking Opera, literature and folk legends. \"You can learn about people\\\\\\'s lives in different periods of time through these pictures, such as how they dressed or what they ate. The pictures are different in different places in China,\" Ye says. Ye\\\\\\'s work contains motifs that make the door gods look modern. The karaoke microphone, camera, bird cage, high buildings, wheels, cars and a flying astronaut all reflect different aspects of our society today, she explains. Parts of the massive image are made up of stickers that are small in size and feature popular symbols like Hello Kitty and Angry Birds. \"It\\\\\\'s the first time for me to create a Spring Festival picture in such a modern way. I thought they were only made by craftsmen, who teach apprentices,\" Ye says. Illustrator Eszter Chen also says it\\\\\\'s a new way to represent the traditional genre in the digital era and in a style typical of a younger generation. The 28-year-old, Taipei-based illustrator created an electronic version focusing on the important dinner on the eve of the Chinese New Year. In Chen\\\\\\'s picture, friends gathered around dining tables have their phones or handheld devices with them. They either send messages bearing good wishes while eating together or have a video chat with those who are away. Even a rooster has a phone in hand - well, in wing. \"It\\\\\\'s common to see such kinds of family gatherings. It\\\\\\'s interesting,\" says Chen. She recalls that, during her childhood, Spring Festival pictures were printed on calendars, featuring chubby children or various gods. After the family dinner, people set off fireworks and visited relatives. Chen moved to California after primary school. It was impossible to have many relatives at such dinners there. She says the people in her picture are friends and neighbors from a community, who gather to celebrate the occasion in the era of globalization. Dishes on their tables are from different regions of China and include hotpot, seafood, dumplings and tea. \"Times are changing, and technology is changing, too. But New Year pictures will always be our way to celebrate the festival - just through different media,\" says Chen. Xie Wei, a marketing manager from Apple Inc, says that at a time when people are complaining about the disappearing traditions surrounding Spring Festival, technology is helping to revive them in a way that appeals to youth. dengzhangyu@chinadaily.com.cn       (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page20)\\'\\n \\'Same people all the time , i dont know how you can fix this corruption http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/10_09_01_krongard.html\\'\\n \\'Editor\\\\\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. You\\\\\\'ve probably read all about it in the news - the annual exodus of migrant workers from the cities. For the past week, millions of Chinese have risked smog, snow and fog to hurry home for dinner. The migrant masses would have planned for months and booked their tickets way in advance for this crucial trip. Today is the eve of the lunar new year, a day which will start off the Spring Festival holidays. The meal we\\\\\\'re talking about is the all-important reunion banquet, the last dinner of the year for the whole family - tuanyuanfan. It is a time-tested tradition for the extended family to gather for this dinner, no matter how far away they\\\\\\'ve gone from home during the year.     - Clockwise from top: It is a happy occasion with the extended family at the all-important reunion banquet of the year. Jiaozi is a must on the occasion, which symbolizes the changeover from old to new. Mahjong is the icing on the cake. Chuai Chatu / For China Daily   For many in China, this is also the only holiday they get to spend with their family, when they can relax for a few days and catch up with friends, eat, drink, play and sleep late before they go back to the grind. It is a happy occasion, a loud raucous celebration with lots of card games, mahjong and merry-making. But most important of all, it is a time for all Chinese to reconnect with their cultural and culinary roots. It is a time to pay respects to the parents by acknowledging and honoring the effort they had invested in the family. It is a time to bond with siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles. It is also a time to feast. The reunion dinner table will be overflowing with the most delicious tastes of home, all appropriately named to usher in peace, prosperity, happiness and good luck for the new year. In the frozen north, a feast of fish is the best way to celebrate. Fish is yu, homophonic with great abundance, and an ingredient that is treasured for its rarity. Huge half-meter monsters are fished from the frozen lakes and rivers in massive operations that involve the whole community. The fish will be seared, then braised in iron pans with sloping sides on which grain pancakes will bake, later to be eaten with both fish and pan juices. Still north of the Yangtze, wheat is the staple and noodles and dumplings appear with monotonous regularity at every festive occasion. For the Spring Festival, dumplings are part of the menu of comfort foods. Jiaozi sounds like the words for transition, symbolizing the changeover from old to new. In many places, the home chefs will place little surprises in the dumplings - a red Chinese date, a little silver coin, a cooked chestnut. The fortunate bachelor who gets the red date in his dumpling will have a sweetheart in the new year, while the chestnut will bring a new baby to the family. The silver coin signifies good luck and prosperity and is probably the most coveted prize. For symbolic dishes served at the reunion dinner, no one does it better than the Cantonese. Every dish on the table is carefully named so the entire menu reflects an abundance of blessings. There will always be a whole fish, niannian youyu, for abundance every year. This dish is usually saved so it can be served again on the first day of the new year, so the riches of the past year will continue to be enjoyed. An entire pig trotter braised with black moss and mushrooms may be the next attraction, facai zhushou. This dish represents wealth and prosperity. Another popular dish is fried diced seafood and vegetables wrapped in beancurd skin and steamed. These little \"money bags\" are called jinyin mantang, or halls filled with gold and silver. Dried oysters, known as hou-see in Cantonese, are often cooked with mushrooms so the businessmen in the family will find a good marketplace for their products and services. The list goes on.    It is normally during dinner that the young, unmarried members of the family will get their yasuiqian, red packets of money that will help them enter the new year happily and safely. The festivities will slowly peak after dinner. Once the dishes are cleared and washed, the dough boards will be brought out. In the north, the whole family will start kneading dough and rolling out dumpling skins. Trays of dumplings will be set out, ready for the next day. Traditionally, there will be minimal cooking on the first day of the Spring Festival, a time devoted to welcoming close relatives and friends to the house. As the family gather to make dumplings, the television will be tuned in to the annual variety show put out by national broadcasters, China Central Television. It is entertainment designed to please the whole family, with songs, dances, skits, magic acts and the beloved acrobatic and martial arts displays. If there is an elderly person in the household, the family will be careful to keep bright lights burning as a prayer for longevity. At 11 pm, the start of the hour of the Rat, the New Year officially begins and the young ones will gather in gardens and backyards to light firecrackers and fireworks. For the next 15 days, the normal ban on fireworks will be lifted in all major Chinese cities and there will be firecrackers all day and fireworks displays each night. The card games, mahjong sessions, eating and drinking will go on almost all night, at least until the Golden Rooster crows and ushers in a brand new lunar year.

In urban China, people learn Christmas carols primarily in shopping malls and celebrate the New Year by taking advantage of holiday discounts on Taobao. In keeping with this modern-day ritual, our character this time is ä¹?(mÇ\\\\x8ei, purchase, buy). The traditional version for ä¹?is è²? on which you can still find traces of its pictographic past. On top of the character is the ç½?(wÇ\\\\x8eng, net) radical, and on the bottom, the è´?(b¨¦i, cowry shells) radical. As cowry shells were used as an early form of currency in China and many parts of the world, together, they form the image of goods exchanged with currency and put into a net.    By the same logic, the character for \"sell\" is a slight variation of \"buy\" - adding an \"out\" radical on top of the character, indicating the reverse flow of goods from the net. Originally created based on the image of grass growing out of the earth, the \"out\" radical evolved into the \"å\\\\x8d? radical. Put this simplified radical on top of ä¹? you get å\\\\x8d?(mÃ\\\\xa0i) or \"\"sell\"\". Naturally\\'\\n \\'A young woman from China\\\\\\'s hinterland, with few qualities believed necessary for success, claws her way to online respectability by following loads of chutzpah with growing sophistication. During the latest US presidential election, most Chinese pundits followed the prognostication of mainstream American media and wrote off Donald Trump as an outlier with more entertainment value than a real chance of winning. A notable exception was Luo Yufeng, who did not belong to any think tank here in China or Stateside. A month before the November election, she said, based on the Twitter accounts of Trump and Clinton that she followed, she sensed more support for Trump. On the day of the election, she posted an article about a trailer driver she knew, which ended up explaining Trump\\\\\\'s unexpected victory better than almost all Chinese-language analysis that surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the event.    The driver, who Luo claims to have known for several years, used to make a decent living by hauling big loads across the American continent. He could rake in considerable cash during the holiday seasons like Christmas because he was willing to work while others would take the time off for family gatherings. But, with the inflow of new immigrants, his pay flattened out and then started a long decline. Now he had to consider quitting the business. He legally migrated to the United States a decade ago, and his livelihood, unlike that of most middle-class American families, was threatened by the wave of illegal immigrants under a Democratic administration. Luo\\\\\\'s article did not draw any conclusions. She just gave a vivid description of one person and his quandary. Luo works in a New York beauty parlor, earning a living by clipping nails for customers. She is the furthest thing from a talking head in an ivory tower or power center. She is plugged in to the grassroots, at least the social segment that is her crowd in terms of linguistic preference and social background. Back home in China, her writing has gained a sizable following.    A following that used to mock her for her plain looks and ungainly behavior. In the past year and half, many of her early detractors have publicly apologized for their ugly words of prejudice against her. Each of her articles is followed by an endless string of apologies such as this on the iFeng site: \"Sister Phoenix, I was one of those who had ruthlessly ridiculed you. I didn\\\\\\'t know it was a complex thing to evaluate someone. I just took the surface for what it is. I have since discovered your talent and your insight and your perseverance. \"I have read all your writings. And I can say that many of those empty-talking experts are just out there for self-gain. Only you have articulated the hardships of people at the bottom of society like us. My sincerest apology to you.\" Sister Phoenix, or Fengjie, is her online moniker, patterned on a character in a literary classic. For several years it was a name people loved to hate, or at least to laugh at. A profile in People magazine called her \"China\\\\\\'s most hated reality star\". Indeed, there was reason enough to take her as a joke as she was positioning herself as more or less a clown for the purpose of public attention. Luo, born in 1985, hailed from a poor village in the hinterland. She attended college for three years and worked as an elementary school teacher for two years. Then she decided to head for the bright lights. Moving to Shanghai, she found that competition was more fierce in the big city. She was working at the checkout counter of a supermarket when she began to use the dating game as her platform for self-promotion. She turned herself into an instant laughing stock when she listed her ideal men, who included a couple of Chinese superstars and the US president.    Her outrageous remarks, such as her self-assessment as \"one with the highest IQ in 300 years and 300 more years from now\", kept her in the limelight, winning her the title \"worthy of the Nobel prize in chutzpah\". Coupled with her lack of physical beauty as defined by stars, her brazenness stood out glaringly in a culture that traditionally values modesty and self-effacement. Luo did the rounds of the nation\\\\\\'s reality shows, but rarely made it to the finals. Just as her 15 minutes of fame seemed to be used up - when a report surfaced saying that television shows that included her were considered \"too vulgar\" by the regulators and faced a regulatory crackdown - she got a visa for the US. After a few years as a footnote to the last internet dynasty, Luo reappeared, this time as a contracted columnist for iFeng, a website previously affiliated with the Phoenix television network. Surprisingly to many, she has mellowed. Yes, she still throws out the occasional repartee that blends a superiority complex with an inferiority complex. But when she uses the form and length of writing traditionally saved for old media, her persona emerges with more subtlety and maturity. She is able to discuss complicated social, political and cross-cultural issues with earthy humor and sharp insight. Luo\\\\\\'s observations of American society, seen from the ultralow perspective of a wannabe immigrant, and the contrast she provides with Chinese society in flux, have exalted her to a position rarely achieved by anyone with better education or pedigree. She gains a ringside view of the US far from the office towers of prestigious media and relays it to a Chinese public who would never bother with a newspaper, let alone its opinion page. Maybe Luo had a split personality from the start. When she was still playing the dating game, some of her poems surfaced, revealing a sensitive soul and a writing proficiency on par with professionals. But they were lost in the crazy whirlwind she had helped whip up around her. Jane Eyre would not have taken this route to fame or fortune, but Luo, a product of reform-era China, has even less to fall back on than the character in the Charlotte Bronte novel. She may not have clawed her way to middle-class respectability yet, but nobody can deny her effort. For her latest posting on Jan 12, titled \"I want your blessings and encouragement\", she received a tidal wave of empathy and appreciation, especially from the huddled masses who used to taunt her.

In China alone, enough food is discarded in restaurants annually to feed between 30 million and 50 million people. China\\\\\\'s challenges were highlighted in late November, when Cheng Shengkui from the Chinese Academy of Sciences told the Food Waste Forum in Beijing that 17 to 18 million tons of food were wasted in China each year from 2013 to 2015. Cheng and his team from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research surveyed almost 7,000 tables and 366 restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai and the southwestern cities of Lhasa and Chengdu.   - Cooks prepare food at a restaurant in Chengdu, in Southwest China\\\\\\'s Sichuan province, on Sept 8 last year. It is estimated that enough food is discarded in restaurants annually in China to feed between 30 million and 50 million people. Provided to China Daily  The team interviewed hundreds of people, collated 7,500 questionnaires and weighed 32,000 dishes. Cheng presented the findings at the seminar hosted by organizations including the United Nations Environment Programme. \"It is no secret that food loss and waste is a big problem,\" says Xie Yuhong, deputy secretary-general of the All-China Environment Federation, a nongovernmental organization supervised by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, during the forum. The problems are myriad, from the methane gas released by food waste into the atmosphere to the fact that discarded food could help to alleviate poverty. One piece of good news is that there are multiple ways to reduce this type of waste, says Luca Mantovani, a consultant at PDA cademia who specializes in facilities management. Big data, for example, can help cafeterias at large companies cut down on waste. Some are tying food production to data from smart cards that employees use to enter buildings. In effect, cafeteria operators can know almost exactly how many people are in the building and how many will go to eat. Big data can also determine what dishes are popular and what dishes are not on given days, depending on who is at work. \"There are buildings that go all out,\" says Mantovani. \"The recycling business in China is quite big.\" The food that consumers throw away is at the tail end of a chain of waste that starts much earlier. In a 2015 study, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum found that 54 percent of waste comes from production, handling, storage, processing and packaging - in other words, in the supply of food. The remaining 46 percent is on the demand side of the equation, including distribution and consumption. Campaigns are under way to reduce this massive footprint. In 2013, for example, the United Nations Environment Programme along with partners launched the Think.Eat.Save initiative to reduce waste. At a more local level, the issue is also significant. In Hong Kong, waste of all types is straining the city\\\\\\'s infrastructure to its breaking point. Most discarded food in the city ends up in landfills along with other types of municipal solid waste, which is general garbage from the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Some 5.5 million tons of solid waste ended up in Hong Kong\\\\\\'s landfills in 2015, with a full third of that being food. The numbers have risen every year since 2010. \"The current practice of disposing of biodegradable food waste at landfills is not sustainable,\" says the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department. \"Reducing food waste disposal at landfills is an important part of the government\\\\\\'s plan for waste management.\" Food is the single largest category of waste in Hong Kong\\\\\\'s landfills and the amount is growing every year. Programs are in place to deal with the problem and the government is working to implement a strategy. \"Our wasteful habits put tremendous pressure on the entire waste chain,\" noted the Hong Kong Environment Bureau (which formulates policies to protect the environment and also enforces related legislation) in a blueprint for the sustainable use of resources for 2013 to 2022. \"We have a large \\\\\\'waste load\\\\\\'. Over the years, Hong Kong people have become more, not less, wasteful,\" it says. Implemented in 2014, the blueprint called for a reduction of solid waste disposal of 20 percent by this year and 40 percent by 2022. By 2013, the daily per capita rate of municipal solid waste had risen to 1.27 kilograms, from 0.97 about a decade earlier. The numbers continued to rise through 2015. At the same time, recycling rates dropped by about a quarter in the decade leading up to 2015. \"It is a pretty protracted process,\" says Gerald Patchell, an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Municipalities in Japan, South Korea and North America all move much faster. In the United States, for example, San Francisco processes all of its waste. \"People make excuses for Hong Kong, and to a certain extent it is valid, about the structure of the city and the environment in a lot of the buildings not having facilities for this type of thing,\" Patchell says. \"Probably the biggest bugbear is this idea that everything is dealt with in Hong Kong.\" In other large cities around the world, trash is sent to the outskirts or hinterland. Hong Kong does not have a big enough region to do that, unless it sends its waste to the Chinese mainland. Personal space is also smaller in Hong Kong, so not a lot of room exists to store, say, multiple containers for different types of trash. One effective program is run by the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the government body which manages the international airport. Since 2003, it has been building and expanding the infrastructure to recycle and dispose of food waste, which is composted into soil used for landscaping. In 2011, the program expanded to collect waste from 17 partners and distribute it to a company that converts it into animal feed. A pilot program in 2014 included a shopping mall near the airport. Some 1,200 tons of food waste were collected from the airport in 2015. That same year, 32 tons of surplus food was picked up in Hong Kong by Food Angel, a nongovernmental organization, and was used to produce 25,000 meal boxes for the city\\\\\\'s poor. The airport program is unique but relatively small compared to the thousands of tons of waste that ends up in Hong Kong\\\\\\'s three operating landfills. The Hong Kong government aims to develop five to six organic waste treatment facilities that can recycle as much as 1,500 tons per day. The first of these plants began construction in 2014 and is expected to be commissioned this year. It has the capacity to treat as much as 200 tons per day. A second plant, with a daily capacity of 300 tons, is still in the planning stages. But the sheer amount of food waste is creating or exacerbating problems in Hong Kong. There is simply no space to put all that waste. Already, the city\\\\\\'s three landfills are running out of space and will all be full by 2019. Hong Kong has already closed 13 landfills. Joyce Chan is the chief operations officer at the Foodlink Foundation, a Hong Kong charity dedicated to reducing food waste. She noted that repurposing food to feed those in need would \"not have an enormous impact on the total amount of food waste that is being disposed into our landfills, but it is still necessary, especially when there is a social need for good-quality, edible food\". But dealing with the issue will require a holistic approach, according to Chan, who says the biggest issues relate to the \"displacement of responsibility\". \"We should not assume that food waste is the responsibility of the food industry, as it is largely demand-driven,\" says Chan. \"If consumers are more conscious of the amount of food waste they generate and everyone plays a role in minimizing their personal food waste, then we can do better as a community.\" For China Daily (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page18)\\'\\n \\'When Ahmed Asim was a boy his career path had already been laid out before him \"My job is to make people feel at home, literally, since this has been my home for the past 30 years,\" says Ahmed Asim, room director of the St. Regis Vommuli hotel in the Maldives. Between his generation and that of his parents, his country has turned from a gathering of specks in the Indian Ocean to one of the world\\\\\\'s best-known and most desired escapes. Yet for Asim, the notion of escape is virtually nonexistent, if not laughable.    \"For me, this only provides an initiation to the outside world as they are coming to us in planeloads.\" His entry into this world came early, he says. When he was at primary school, property owners invited him and his classmates to tour the resort islands, where human endeavor tries to emulate natural beauty in creating paradise on Earth - sometimes with unintended results. \"\\\\\\'Wow!\\\\\\' was my reaction,\" Asim recalls, casting an incredulous look. \"Then I told myself: \\\\\\'Someday I\\\\\\'m going to work here.\\\\\\'\" The wide-eyed child has given way to a soft-spoken man with a confident air, and in the meantime he has gained a diploma in hospitality and worked as a trainee butler and then as a butler for many years in a number of hotels, some of them luxury ones. He joined the St. Regis at Vommuli as room director in October, when preparations were being made for the hotel\\\\\\'s grand opening. \"Between 50 and 60 percent of our 300-strong staff are Maldivians,\" Asim says. \"Quite a few of us, including me, are in management.\" Spending the bulk of his time in air-conditioned rooms or traveling in buggies from villa to villa, Asim\\\\\\'s life is a world apart from that of his parents, who have seven children in total. \"Like most Maldivian families of their generation, my father made a living out of fishing while my mother did household chores. The sea around here is probably the calmest on Earth. I\\\\\\'ve never heard of anyone who died out fishing in the sea. But still, the sun and the wind can be unforgiving; that\\\\\\'s why few young people are involved in fishing today.\" His father usually left home about 5:30 am and fished for tuna all day before returning in the evening, he says. \"Ours was a small boat. There were also bigger boats on which one can go out fishing in the sea for weeks at a time. But whatever you go out in, small or big, fishing in the Maldives has to be by pole instead of by net. We do angling all the time. The fish nets are reserved only for the capture of baitfish - fish used as bait when angling. \"Our government has been very aggressive when it comes to environmental protection. That\\\\\\'s why we still have what we had 20 or 30 years ago.\" Asked whether angling is a financially viable way of fishing, Asim says that on a good day, a good angler can catch up to 2,000 tuna. The fish tend to appear in groups, and when you really think about it, that kind of catch suggests the fish must be virtually jumping onto the hook, if not directly into the boat. These days, though, fishing has decreased compared with 20 years ago. Asim\\\\\\'s parents stopped fishing about 15 years ago and now live in Male, the country\\\\\\'s capital. The catch, apart from fulfilling local needs, goes on to the dining tables of tourists. At the St. Regis, amid offerings of caviar, lobster, truffle, foie gras and Kobe beef, I discovered a course unpretentiously titled \"Catch of the day\". I tried it and did not regret my decision. Later, as I spent my last day in the Maldives at the Sheraton on Full Moon Island, I encountered the same offering and realized that it was a local signature dish. Ayyoub Salameh, director of culinary service at the St. Regis, says the hotel buys 600 kilograms of fish each day from local fishermen for the consumption of guests and hotel staff. It also buys produce from local farmers. \"I don\\\\\\'t think I\\\\\\'ll stay in the country for life, so I\\\\\\'m going to deliver something for it,\" says the master cook, a Jordanian, who is also creating a garden for local spices and herbs. Similar willingness is also expressed by Wong Chiu Man and his wife Maria Warner Wong, the architectural duo and Harvard graduates who designed the St. Regis at Vommuli. \"The Vommuli House is inspired by the extending roots of banyan trees,\" Warner Wong says. \"The parts were prefabricated and pre-engineered before being sent to Vommuli for rapid erection with the help of Maldivian workers. In this way we have tried to be environmentally friendly while passing on construction skills to locals.\" Once, the couple was invited for a drink at a nearby island, only to discover that the hostess, a Maldivian who had previously worked on the construction site at Vommuli, had fashioned her little bar using discarded plywood she had gathered from the St. Regis site. Wong Chiu Man, asked about any misgivings he has about the hotel\\\\\\'s design, said that if he had his chance again he would pay greater heed to any risks such a project posed to the environment. \"The construction of the water villas did cause the bleaching of corals on a scale I hate to see.\" But as tourists pour in, won\\\\\\'t further stress be put on the country\\\\\\'s unspoiled beauty and fragile ecosystem? \"I don\\\\\\'t see that happening,\" Asim says. \"First of all, the Maldives is a high-end tourist destination, as we cater to a niche market. This is especially true in our case. For the moment, the government has adopted a very positive attitude toward developing tourism. A college in Male offers a master\\\\\\'s degree in hospitality and tourism.\" However, he acknowledges that even though tourists started coming to the Maldives in the 1970s, it is only in the past five years that the country\\\\\\'s tourism industry has really taken off. Asim, married with a two-and-a-half-year-old son, sees differences in the ways childhoods were spent before and now. \"For me it was just the sun, sand and sea; for him it\\\\\\'s more about colorful toys.\" Because of Asim\\\\\\'s job, he can see his wife and son as often as he would like to. Fan Qianyi, a Chinese diving coach at Vommuli, says this kind of family living arrangement is common among young Maldivians. \"I\\\\\\'ve been here for four years but haven\\\\\\'t seen many Maldivian women. Usually men work outside, on resort islands, while women and children stay behind, in what\\\\\\'s known as the local islands. It reminds me of migrant workers in China - certainly not the best solution.\" Twenty years ago, when Asim first visited a luxury hotel at a resort, he dreamed of being part of what he saw. He has higher hopes for his son. \"I won\\\\\\'t object if he wants to go into the tourism industry - my parents have been very encouraging and all my brothers work in catering - but it would be great if he becomes a doctor or a lawyer.\" For some Maldivians, a simple life, though hard, may have started to change along with their long-held sense of contentment. But with all the building and opening of luxury hotels, is there any talk about possible gentrification, the effect of which might be mitigated by the geographical isolation of each island? \"Such an idea has yet to come to the Maldives,\" Asim says.

A survey by Spring Professional, a subsidiary of human resources company Adecco Group, found that interest among top foreign talent in working in China has risen nearly 150 percent over the past five years. Yet fears over the environment and climate have also increased. Fifty-five percent of 2,000 foreign employees that Spring Professional polled last year - who had each lived in the country for at least five years - said they had concerns about air quality, up from 23 percent in 2012.   - China has been watched closely by foreign job applicants in recent years due to the rapid development of its economy and its openness to overseas talent, but air pollution has hurt the recruitment. Guo Junfeng / For China Daily  Air pollution has hurt recruitment for the past two years, says Ma Erman, head of overseas recruitment for language training company EF English in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province. \"During interview processes, foreign applicants frequently check the air quality index,\" she says. \"Many will turn down an offer after thinking carefully about their health. For those who work here in Shijiazhuang, all of them will visit the hospital several times, especially during winter. \"Hebei doesn\\\\\\'t have many advantages to compete with coastal provinces, which have better economies and offer higher salaries, and air pollution is making recruitment even more difficult.\" According to data provided by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the average daily concentration of PM2.5 - small particulate matter that is hazardous to health - in the country\\\\\\'s 31 provinces, autonomous regions and provinces was 47 micrograms per cubic meter last year, down by 6 percent from 2015 levels. He Kebin, dean of Tsinghua University\\\\\\'s School of Environment, predicts it could take 10 to 15 years for most of the heavily polluted Chinese cities to meet the national air quality standard. China has been watched closely by foreign job applicants in recent years due to the rapid development of its economy and its openness to overseas talent. Hu Xin, a senior consultant at Spring Professional, says China has become more competitive in the talent war compared with five years ago. \"China has an advantage over European countries, whose economy, social order and political situations are deteriorating,\" Hu says. \"In 2015 and 2016, many private firms in China had a growing demand for high-end overseas technical talent and they are willing to provide attractive salaries and opportunities for promotion.\" However, many expats are having second thoughts as air pollution has become a long-term issue.

Tired of being pestered by relatives for still being single, he has placed an online ad offering to pose as a fake boyfriend for a low fee, mainly out of curiosity and in the hope of helping someone else in the same situation. \"I\\\\\\'m a victim of my parents\\\\\\' dissatisfaction,\" says the 32-year-old, who works in Shanghai and usually returns to his hometown in rural Anhui province for the holiday. \"Instead of enduring more nagging, I\\\\\\'d rather pretend to be a woman\\\\\\'s boyfriend to ease the pressure on her.\" Bian uploaded his ad to 20py.com, one of about five websites that have popped up in recent years to cater to the growing trend of people taking fake partners - often total strangers - to family reunions. Business for such websites has been booming ahead of Spring Festival. \"For the month leading up to Chinese New Year, we\\\\\\'ve handled more than 1,200 connections. Normally, it\\\\\\'s about 100 a month,\" says Wang Jianhua, a spokesman for Zunvyou, a website based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. (The name means \"rent a girlfriend\".) Prices soar at this time, too. \"It costs about 1,000 yuan ($145; 135 euros; 116) a day right now, compared with about 600 yuan on average,\" Wang says, and that doesn\\\\\\'t include transportation and meals. Demand is so high that such websites, which first began to emerge in 2014, make as much at Spring Festival as they do during the rest of the year combined. To post an ad, users must register with their personal information, including age, occupation and height, and upload a headshot. Clients can list special requirements. They are required to pay a deposit - usually half the rental price - and must submit proof of identity and employment. Platforms charge a service fee of 10 to 20 percent. Wang says most of Zunvyou\\\\\\'s clients work in large cities but come from smaller cities or rural areas, where people are generally expected to be married by their mid-20s. 20py.com, based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, has more than 3 million registered members. The ratio of men to women is 10:1. Such a gender imbalance is common, which Wang put down to women having more safety concerns. He says Zunvyou and other sites have introduced measures to prevent potential threats to personal safety and property. \"We make clients meet first in a public venue and send their location to our employees when they take a \\\\\\'partner\\\\\\' to their hometown,\" he says. \"We also encourage them to keep their cellphones switched on at all times in case of emergency.\" While some offer themselves up for rent as a way to make money, Bian says he is charging only 200 yuan a day.

The attack at around 3:45 p.m. local time targeted Supreme Court employees as they were leaving for the day, Mojahid said. At least 35 people were wounded in the blast, according to Saleem Rasooli, head of Kabul hospitals. There have been no initial claims of responsibility. An eyewitness told CNN that he felt the explosion shake the ground as he was leaving his office, opposite the Supreme Court. Nimatullah Mati said the area is home to several residential apartments and was crowded Tuesday afternoon with people who were heading home from work. Ambulances and firetrucks arrived on the scene within five minutes, Mati said. Afghanistan\\\\\\'s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, expressed his condolences on Twitter. \"The blood of our people isn\\\\\\'t cheap & won\\\\\\'t be wasted,\" he said. NATO also condemned the attack. \"Anyone who seeks to destabilize the pillars of a functioning government are enemies of Afghanistan,\" Italian army Lt. Gen. Rosario Castellano, deputy commander of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement. The blast comes a month after at least 36 people were killed and dozens wounded in two suicide bombings near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for those January 10 attacks. Tuesday\\\\\\'s blast underscores the growing concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, where the country\\\\\\'s security forces and its international allies have been fighting Taliban militants and other radical groups for years. A new report Monday from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said more than 11,000 people were killed or injured in 2016. That\\\\\\'s the highest number of civilian casualties in a single year since the United Nations began systemically documenting those in 2009. The report also shows a record spike in the number of children killed in the long-running Afghanistan War. Of the 3,498 killed last year, 923 were children, the report said. Anti-government forces, mainly the Taliban, were behind almost two-thirds of the casualties, according to the report.

China will firmly safeguard its maritime sovereignty, as it holds talks with countries directly involved, to maintain stability in the region, she said. Hua had been asked to respond to White House spokesman Sean Spicer\\\\\\'s comment on Jan 23 that \"the US would make sure that we protect our interests\" in the South China Sea. On Jan 11, Trump\\\\\\'s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson said that China should be denied access to the South China Sea islands. Hua, when asked whether China worried that the Trump administration would take further steps regarding the sea, said that China is not the only country concerned about that. \"China\\\\\\'s position on the South China Sea is consistent, and our actions are justified,\" she said. Tensions have cooled over the South China Sea issue since China and other countries involved, including the Philippines, agreed to peacefully solve disputes through negotiations. In October, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte made a state visit to China, during which the two nations agreed to restore bilateral ties that had been jeopardized by the ruling of an arbitration unilaterally launched by his predecessor, Benigno Aquino III. \"Any responsible country should be glad to see this trend, and play a positive role in promoting regional peace and stability,\" Hua said on Jan 24. Li Haidong, a professor of US studies at China Foreign Affairs University, said the Trump administration\\\\\\'s attitude toward the South China Sea is similar to his predecessor\\\\\\'s - namely, emphasizing disputes there. \"While Obama dealt with it in so-called multilateral and legal ways, Trump might try to get rough and try to overwhelm China with force there,\" he said. The South China Sea will continue to be an increasingly disputed area between the two countries, he speculated. However, Li said, it remained to be seen whether Washington would follow up on Tillerson\\\\\\'s proposal because of \"Trump\\\\\\'s unpredictability and the different opinions within the Cabinet\". \"The Trump administration might make an adjustment, adopt a more practical China policy after six months, when it sees it has failed to force China to concede to its aggressive manner regarding issues Washington believes are critical,\" he added. Teng Jianqun, a senior US studies researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, said the Trump administration will continue to test China on various issues, including trade and security, but China will never compromise on territorial issues.

The number of newborns increased by 1.31 million compared with 2015. The portion of the births to couples who already had at least one child rose quickly to at least 45 percent last year, Yang Wenzhuang, a division director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference on Jan 22. The proportion was around 30 percent before 2013. \"It demonstrates that the universal second-child policy came in time and worked effectively,\" Yang said.   - Second-child policy implemented early last year was a major factor in raising the number of births in China to 17.86 million last year. Provided to China Daily  \"Some regions, mostly large cities in eastern areas, began recording second children as comprising more than half of local newborns,\" he added. Yang expected that by 2020, the number of new births each year would stand between 17 and 20 million in China, citing expert estimates. Ma Xiaowei, deputy director of the commission, said recently a baby boom triggered largely by the new policy would probably come within the next two years. For that, the commission plans to add 140,000 more maternity health workers in the coming years, he said. The top decision-makers intensified efforts in late 2013 to adjust birth policies in place for three decades that limited most couples to just one child, hoping to address major demographic challenges such as an aging population and a looming labor shortage. Starting in early 2014, couples of which one person was an only child could have a second child. The universal second-child policy was implemented at the start of 2016. \"The long-term effect of the universal second-child policy is very helpful to China\\\\\\'s sustainable development,\" says Yuan Xin, a professor of population studies at Nankai University in Tianjin. By 2050, the policy is expected to bring about an extra 30 million working-age people and reduce the nation\\\\\\'s aging rate by 2 percent, commission projections show. But matching policies have not yet been refined to provide good support for couples willing to have more than one child, particularly in terms of maternity education and health services, Yang conceded. A 2015 survey by the commission found nearly 75 percent of respondents were reluctant to have a second baby, largely due to economic burdens. Other major concerns are age, parents\\\\\\' career development and a lack of caregivers, it showed. Yuan suggested the government introduce support measures like favorable tax policies, prolonged maternity leave and education for families with two children. shanjuan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page14)\\'\\n \\'Officials representing Beijing and Manila shook hands on joint projects worth $3.7 billion on Jan 23 during a meeting in the Chinese capital.

While the specific types of deals and locations were not revealed, the package is the initial installment of planned cooperative projects aiming to improve livelihoods, Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng told reporters at a news briefing. The briefing came after discussions with a delegation led by Philippines Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Dominguez, in China from Jan 22 to Jan 24, led a heavyweight delegation, including ministerial officials responsible for areas such as economic planning, telecommunications, financing and public projects. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that several Filipino ministers have led delegations to China recently to discuss such areas as trade, infrastructure and energy. It has \"fully showcased the consistent increase in mutual trust and increasingly deepened cooperative relationships,\" Hua said on Jan 23. Also on Jan 23, the two sides agreed to a speedy resumption of meetings of the China-Philippines Joint Commission on Economic and Trade Cooperation, an important body that ground to a halt in 2012 as the relationship deteriorated over territorial sovereignty issues. Vice-Premier Wang Yang, who met with the Philippines delegation, said the countries also should gear up their joint efforts in drafting a plan for bilateral economic and trade cooperation and press ahead with their priority bilateral projects. China is now the second-largest trade partner of the Philippines. The relationship warmed markedly after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte paid his first state visit to China in October. Duterte is expected to make a second trip to China in May to attend an international forum on building the China-led Belt and Road Initiative.

The smog is expected to gradually disperse from north to south due to winds. The National Environmental Monitoring Center also forecast severe smog for parts of Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces, though it said the forecast for the coming weekend might not be accurate due to the changing weather and emissions situation.

Even if he did not say precisely that, it is how his pithy aphorism is best remembered. It is a handy phrase for democrats to fall back on when democracy appears to be under pressure. China\\\\\\'s People\\\\\\'s Daily reflected recently that Western-style democracy used to be recognized as a historical driver of social development. But now, it has reached its limits. In an analysis that will find an echo among many disgruntled voters in the West, it suggested democracy had been hijacked as a weapon for capitalists to boost their profits. A widespread sentiment within Western electorates, that they have been ignored and left behind by self-perpetuating elites, is seen as a key factor in recent election and referendum results in the US and Britain and may play a role in future outcomes of 2017.    On the face of it, the Brexit referendum vote in Britain and Donald Trump\\\\\\'s victory in the US should be regarded as a vindication of the democratic system - the people were given a choice and they have made their decision. Both results, however, have spurred soul-searching about what these outcomes mean for the future of a political system that is intended to safeguard the interests of all its citizens, not just those who picked the winner. A worrying trend that has emerged is a \"winner-takes-all\" attitude among the victors. Among some who voted for Brexit on the ostensible grounds that it would allow the UK to regain its democratic rights from an undemocratic European Union, a discomfiting tendency has emerged to delegitimize the views of those who continue to warn about the negative consequences of that decision. For example, the UK\\\\\\'s pro-Brexit Daily Mail newspaper described a legal challenge to launching Brexit without the assent of Parliament as an unpatriotic attempt to subvert the will of the people. It is an attitude of \"We won, you lost, shut up\". Similarly, in the US, there are fears that the new administration has little tolerance for the kind of dissent displayed by demonstrators on the streets of Washington the day after President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s inauguration. Those fears may be misplaced and, to be fair to Trump, he conceded that \"peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy\" after earlier castigating the demonstrators for overlooking the results of the election.    A prevailing view among liberal analysts, however, and more than a few conservative commentators, is that Trump\\\\\\'s brand of populism poses a threat to American democratic values. A Washington Post article by veteran conservative commentator George Will referred to Trump\\\\\\'s \"feral cunning in manipulating the masses and the media\" and implicitly criticized the hostile tone the new president has adopted toward China and others. Others have decried the authoritarian tendencies Trump displayed during his campaign and his alleged anti-democratic behavior since the election. \"Donald J. Trump\\\\\\'s election has raised a question that few Americans ever imagined asking: Is our democracy in danger?\" academics Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt told readers of the New York Times back in December. Little over a quarter-century ago, the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama was arguing that the spread of liberal democracy and free market capitalism might be the endpoint of humanity\\\\\\'s social evolution. It has been something of a rocky road since then. But it is perhaps a little premature to write off democracy as a system that has brought no positive benefits to those societies where it has evolved. Recent events should, however, generate some humility within the democratic camp and a recognition that other societies with other histories and cultures have taken a different road. Within the international context, what is important is to reinforce the partnerships that have evolved since World War II among societies at various stages of social, political and economic development to tackle the daunting challenges that we all face.

This report is the result of groundbreaking, new research that provides tremendous insight into the brand-building progress made by Chinese companies in overseas markets. The research methodology focuses on overseas consumers\\\\\\' attitudes, beliefs and feelings toward Chinese brands. Chinese companies and China\\\\\\'s image have been subjected to considerable investigative research over many years, but rarely have Chinese product and service brands been singled out with an in-depth, mainly qualitative research study. In total, 167 established Chinese brands were included in the study, for which consumers were surveyed across seven of the world\\\\\\'s most developed market economies: the United Kindom, France, Spain, Germany, the United States, Australia and Japan. World-leading advertising and public relations agency WPP and global market research company Kantar Millward Brown collaborated with Google to produce the pioneering report.    The report\\\\\\'s overall findings make for extremely encouraging reading for those Chinese brands hoping to continue their expansion deeper into overseas markets. More and more Chinese brands now enjoy increasing brand awareness levels. But the report\\\\\\'s most significant claim concludes that the circumstances are now very favorable for Chinese brands to build powerful brands based on their high quality and emotional connections with overseas consumers. Lenovo, China\\\\\\'s PC giant and the world\\\\\\'s largest producer by sales volume, was named the most powerful Chinese global brand builder at present. This should come as no surprise, given Lenovo\\\\\\'s clear commitment to international expansion ever since its audacious acquisition of the IBM PC brand well over 10 years ago. Close behind Lenovo comes another consumer electronics brand success story in the shape of Huawei, China\\\\\\'s giant multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company, headquartered in South China\\\\\\'s city of Shenzhen, in Guangdong province. In recent years, Huawei has proven it can compete with even its fiercest rivals, such as Apple and Samsung. Huawei\\\\\\'s acclaimed P9 smartphone provides demonstrable proof of the company\\\\\\'s commitment to technological innovation, high quality standards, brand building and it is rumored that an even better model, the Huawei P10, could be launched very soon. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is ranked third, which should also come as no surprise, given its fairly recent listing on the US stock exchange.    Chinese consumer electronics brands represent a large share of the higher-ranked brands, with smartphone brand Xiaomi coming in at number 5, the third consumer electronics brand in the top 5. The report finds that these higher-ranked brands now compete far less in price than they used to and have gained an enviable reputation for quality, reliability and service in the minds of overseas consumers. But in addition to a cluster of strong consumer electronics brands, Chinese internet brands are also making more than a good name for themselves around the world and are seen by many overseas consumers as very competitively innovative. The report does still present challenges facing Chinese brands in their quest for global recognition and relevance. Overseas consumers, despite growing acceptance of and trust in Chinese brands, reveal an almost habitual reach toward longer-established global brands, rather than the Chinese \"new kids on the block\". But even this habit appears to be waning, as Chinese brands prove themselves more and more and rely on price less and less. It is also apparent from the report that consumer likelihood of purchasing a Chinese brand over an established, non-Chinese rival brand varies from country to country. In France, Germany and Spain, for instance, consumers appear far more likely to consume a Chinese brand, while Japanese, British and American consumers still hold stronger attachments to locally produced brands. Furthermore, geographical proximity can, at least partially, contribute to brand recognition. There may also be some sort of \"hangover\" effect taking place, due to which American and Japanese consumers still hang on to the past, even the very recent past, when their countries were widely seen as technological pioneers. But now, according to the study, consumers are increasingly looking to China and Chinese companies for the latest technology breakthroughs, making now the most opportune time for Chinese brands to penetrate global markets. Gone is China\\\\\\'s image of low prices and low quality in its products and brands. This decline in negativity, which dogged Chinese brand building in the past, has also been matched by an increase in consumer involvement when deciding on brand consumption choice. The report finds that fame alone is no longer as significant a factor as it once was when consumers choose brands. Instead, a more rational, conscious and self-confident consumer now places tangible benefits and relevance higher. This has helped Chinese brands compete with brands which have enjoyed international fame for far longer. Harnessing the power of the internet also explains the international rise of many Chinese brands, such as Alibaba and Tencent. Chinese, internet-driven brands have shown that it is not necessary to initially focus on the domestic market to ensure steady growth, but that internet-driven innovation can allow a brand to explode on to the global scene with almost overnight success. Despite a welter of positive findings, the report does also provide a sobering assessment of the challenges facing Chinese brands in increasingly competitive overseas markets. High among these challenges is the need for even more creativity and innovation, perhaps not in the use of the latest technology, but in brands\\\\\\' marketing initiatives. Innovation in technology is an absolute necessity on today\\\\\\'s global battle of the brands, but it is not on its own sufficient. Brands have to build on this very tangible form of growth with layer upon layer of emotional meaning that resonates with consumers\\\\\\' increasing need for emotionally-fulfilling lifestyle experiences. Creativity in all aspects of a brand\\\\\\'s appearance and promotion is now the next hurdle for Chinese companies to overcome. But even here, there are encouraging signs, with Chinese companies such as Huawei investing heavily in sports and entertainment sponsorships to build emotional connections with overseas consumers, augmenting its reputation for quality and service. So what could this all mean for European businesses? Should Chinese brands be seen as friend or foe? At a glance, the answer to this question may appear to be the latter, but looking into the question further should yield a different conclusion. This is good news for European industries in which the rise of Chinese brands internationally represents many substantial opportunities. Chinese brands will now be seeking more long-term cooperation with European partners all along the supply chain, for example. European brands can also now see their Chinese competitors as an opportunity to learn from their technological excellence, in particular. The idea that the rise of Chinese brands internationally poses a significant threat should be dispelled when pinpointing the sources of Chinese brands\\\\\\' success. It was, and still is, the firm presence of Western brands across the China mainland that initiated this brand-building path. Chinese companies learned extensively from these newly arrived Western brands and were spurred on to become even more competitive than their established Western rivals. If Chinese brands can rise to the arrival of Western brands in China, then surely European brands can do likewise now that more and more Chinese brands have arrived in their backyard.

But whether there will be a full-scale trade war is up to Donald Trump, because that\\\\\\'s what he said he wanted. What the Chinese should do is not just talk, explaining that trade war isn\\\\\\'t a good thing. They can do many things, starting right now, to make the economy less vulnerable to outside influences and stronger against imminent trade war attacks. No matter on how many fronts and how seemingly powerful the trade war is, it comes from the outside after all. How much resistance an economy can mobilize depends primarily on internal factors. Having long foreseen the unsustainability of its export-driven growth since the 1990s, China has, beginning almost 10 years ago, been gradually reducing its dependence on foreign trade.    Not only has the total volume of its exports been in decline, the ratio between export and total GDP fell from 37 percent 10 years ago to around 20 percent, according to the World Bank. Although it is higher than the US level, it is lower than that of many trading nations in Asia and Europe. Admittedly, in volume, the figure for China\\\\\\'s export of goods to the US is still much larger than that for imports, registered as $482 billion versus $116 billion by the Office of the US Trade Representative. But a large proportion of it was made-for-US consumer brands. Should US businesses discard the production they have partnered with in China and ship the $300 billion-plus-worth of business entirely home, that would be more than 2 trillion yuan ($308.6 billion; 208.6 billion euros; 184.9 billion), as compared with China\\\\\\'s total GDP of some 74 trillion yuan in 2016, or less than 3 percent of the latter. It may not be extremely hard for China to redirect that amount of productivity to other markets, domestic and foreign. At least mathematically, Chinese society has become different from the way it was 20 years ago. A rise in the general income level in coastal cities should have created enough middle class consumers who want to spend more, evidence of which is also seen in data for the spending of Chinese tourists abroad. With smart management, China may better utilize that new potential of its society, to provide its middle class consumers with goods of better quality and better services.    One handy example is the rapid expansion of the high-speed rail network. At the beginning of the rail modernization program, many people doubted its commercial viability. In fact, many of the long, hugely expensive railways cannot be expected to generate a profit in a just two to three years. But the nation\\\\\\'s consumer behavior has changed quickly, with an increasing number of people willing to travel for holidays and weekends on the speedy and decent train rides to cities other than their home towns. In 2015, by serving 4 billion visitors, the nation generated 4 trillion yuan in tourist revenue, a much larger amount than its merchandise trade surplus with the US. In 2017, some major high-speed railways were completed to link the more developed coastal cities with the scenic towns in the mountainous West China. With good security protection and more entrepreneurial initiatives, China\\\\\\'s \"high-speed rail economy\" alone can generate enough to compare with the GDP of a medium-sized nation. So in the face of Trump\\\\\\'s statements, the best defense China can have is to never get distracted by his attacks and deceits and be steadfast in pursuing its own economic reform. This is the most effective way China can win the future trade war. The government should do a better job not only in investing in large infrastructure, but also in protecting small enterprises and private initiatives - with good laws and policy terms. It should start acting now. The author is editor-at-large of China Daily. Contact the writer atedzhang@chinadaily.com.cn.

Real GDP growth edged up to 6.8 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2016 as services output momentum picked up. This brought whole-year GDP growth to 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 but comfortably exceeding the \"bottom line\" of the 6.5 to 7 percent target range. However, this was at the cost of a further rise in leverage. Overall credit - total social financing excluding equity financing, but including local government bond issuance - grew 16.1 percent in 2016. Rebalancing continued last year. With the service sector outpacing industry and price changes also in favor of services, its share in GDP climbed by 1.2 percentage points to 51.9 percent.    Investment momentum picked up in the fourth quarter of 2016, having weakened mid-year, with growth of fixed asset investment rising to 7.9 percent, supported by some improvement in corporate investment. Surprisingly, real estate fixed asset investment also accelerated again in the fourth quarter in spite of measures taken in large cities to contain housing price increases. Consumption remained robust in the fourth quarter, with real retail sales growth 9.1 percent, although passenger car sales slowed in December. The growth in exports of real goods slowed to 1.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. But the three month moving average, the seasonally adjusted monthly export volume, rose a full 4 percent in December, pointing to solid export momentum going into 2017. Consumer price inflation eased in December to 1.9 percent year-on-year on lower food price increases. While the producer price index rose a full 5.5 percent year-on-year, we expect the spurt to run out of steam in the first half of 2017 and forecast consumer price index inflation to remain comfortably below the likely target of 3 percent in 2017, suggesting no major monetary policy implications.    Looking ahead, recent global trade indicators show a decent momentum going into 2017 and we expect it to grow by 2.7 percent this year, from 1.4 percent in 2016. Indeed, China should in principle benefit from any pick-up in growth in the US from more expansionary fiscal policy under the new Trump administration. But, while we do not expect across-the board tariffs, it is clear to us that China\\\\\\'s exports to the US will face a harsher climate. Overall, we expect the export outlook to improve somewhat next year. Domestically, infrastructure investment should remain solid. And corporate investment should benefit from renewed profit growth. But the tightening of housing purchasing restrictions in many large cities will weigh on real estate investment. We expect consumption growth to ease further on moderating wage growth, but to remain relatively solid. Meanwhile, the messages from the Central Economic Work Conference and other recent statements suggest policymakers are moving to put somewhat more emphasis on reducing financial risks and less on ensuring at least 6.5 percent GDP growth. The Central Economic Work Conference provided a mandate for further fiscal expansion but called for a less generous monetary stance. We do not expect a benchmark interest rate rise this year but expect policymakers to guide overall credit growth down to around 14 percent in 2017. Overall, we expect GDP growth to slow to 6.3 percent this year. High uncertainty means Chinese economic policymakers will want to keep their options open. But at least the reasonable current growth momentum gives policy some two-way leeway. The author is the Hong Kong-based head of Asia economics for Oxford Economics.

(China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page12)\\'\\n \\'China should strengthen communication about its policies and takes steps to stabilize its exchange rate According to the latest Central Economic Work Conference of China, preventing and controlling risks is a very important part of its policies. While the global market is in a period of flux, preventing and controlling financial risks in China is more meaningful than ever. Developed countries, such as European countries and the US, have seen the effects of globalization and are taking steps to encourage overseas capital and manufacturing industries to come back to the developed economies. Meanwhile, many countries, including China, no longer have the advantage of cheaper labor costs. These factors could result in some changes in the global industrial chain\\\\\\'s specialization and then influence international capital flow. To the emerging markets, including China, this can mean capital outflow and more challenges in export. The differentiation of global monetary policies and the expected rise of interest rates would help drive capital to flow from emerging markets to the developed countries. China should prevent the risks brought by both the real estate industry and RMB exchange rate at the same time. In the past few years, a large amount of global capital entered the emerging markets in different ways and gathered at the real estate industry and stock market, where the profit rates were relatively high. As China\\\\\\'s own currency was not the international reserve currency, there are problems with currency and maturity mismatch.    Once policies change, the previously in-flowed capital will be evacuated rapidly, which could cause the collapse of assets value, depreciation of the RMB, the slump of the stock market and other systematic risks. At present, the US dollar is becoming stronger, and the RMB is under great pressure of depreciation. Meanwhile, the domestic real estate market is under stricter control and capital outflow is growing stronger. If the real estate market is over-cooled or causing individuals to sell their properties and invest overseas, this will aggravate the depreciation of the RMB. Under these circumstances, the control policies over real estate should be tailored for different cities, rather than being the same throughout all of China. A certain degree of capital control needs to be maintained, especially the supervision of capital outflow of companies that are following China\\\\\\'s \"going out\" strategies. For example, some companies are disregarding cost when doing overseas acquisitions, paying high prices for no reason. China should strengthen communication about its policies and take steps to stabilize its exchange rate. China should also be cautious of unexpected, rapid inflation. Since last year, the producer price index (PPI) of industrial products has been much higher due to supply-side reform and exchange rate fluctuation. The consistent rise of the PPI will affect the consumer price index (CPI). If we take international factors into account, Donald Trump\\\\\\'s policies to help with the US\\\\\\' inflation and economic recovery could also lead to global expectation of inflation, which would indirectly influence China\\\\\\'s domestic bonds, stock market and commodities prices. Moreover, if the inflation exceeds expectation, it would restrict what China\\\\\\'s monetary policies could do, making it difficult to prevent and control future financial risks. It is also crucial to prevent global sources from spreading financial risks to China in the current global political and economic environment. In Europe, political turbulence has affected the financial market in the Eurozone. Several important elections will be held this year, including those of the French president and German chancellor, and Brexit is to be carried out soon. The banking system in the eurozone also faces challenges, especially the fragile banking system in Italy, which could affect other banks in the eurozone. These factors will affect the eurozone, even global trade and monetary policies, and have a huge impact on the global financial market. In the US, new President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s policies could raise uncertainties and influence global expectations for inflation and the global financial market. Trump might make big changes to the US\\\\\\' current macro policies. Trump\\\\\\'s stated policies on trade are a form of de-globalization, which may, in a short time, affect China\\\\\\'s exports and apply more pressure to the RMB. At present, it seems China has underestimated the changes that might take place in the China-US relationship after Trump takes office. As many low-income people in developed countries didn\\\\\\'t benefit much from globalization, Trump\\\\\\'s policies will cater to their desires. China should negotiate on that, should the free trade process be blocked. If Trump\\\\\\'s fiscal policy is carried out, it will encourage the rising expectation of inflation, likely causing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to deal with inflation, further pressuring China\\\\\\'s RMB depreciation.

Amnesty\\\\\\'s report, Human slaughterhouse, says prisoners are moved in the middle of the night from their cells under the pretext of being transferred. They are taken to the grounds of the prison, where they are hanged, likely unaware of their fate until they feel the noose around their neck, Amnesty alleges. The report is the culmination of a year-long investigation, including interviews with 84 witnesses including security guards, detainees, judges and lawyers, Amnesty says. Most of those hanged were civilians \"believed to be opposed to the government,\" the report finds. \"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" Lynn Maalouf, the deputy director for research at Amnesty\\\\\\'s Beirut office, said in a statement announcing the report. Amnesty International says there are two detention centers at Saydnaya prison. In the \"red building,\" the majority of detainees are civilians who have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, according to the organization. In the \"white building,\" the detainees are mainly military officers and soldiers. CNN has asked the Syrian government for comment. The report contends that the executed detainees were given a sham trial by \"a so-called Military Field Court.\" \"The judge will ask the name of the detainee and whether he committed the crime. Whether the answer is yes or no, he will be convicted ... This court has no relation with the rule of law. This is not a court,\" a former judge said, according to Amnesty. Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty International researcher, elaborated on the horrific conditions prisoners allegedly face. \"They have been actually dying in massive numbers as a result of repeated torture in combination with the systematic deprivation of food, water, medicine and medical care,\" she told CNN. \"(The report) has gotten the attention it deserved,\" Waldman said. \"It\\\\\\'s a big story.

They have to be brought to an end. Mass killings of civilians and extermination so that people are dying of starvation, of illness, of treatable diseases must stop, and Russia has a very special responsibility to uphold peace and security in the world,\" Waldman said. \"We are calling on them to use their influence with the Syrian authorities to push for access to independent monitors to all of the prisons in Syria run by the government where these atrocities are taking place so the perpetrators can be held to account.\" Speaking at the UN, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Peter Wilson responded to the report\\\\\\'s allegations. \"We have seen the report of Amnesty International on atrocities in Syria,\" he said. \"Our foreign secretary has said he is sickened by that report. We strongly condemn these atrocities, and we continue to effort to shine a light on what\\\\\\'s happening in Syria and to hold people accountable for these actions.\" \\\\\\'Just a headline\\\\\\' President Assad\\\\\\'s regime has previously been accused of extrajudicial killings and war crimes during the country\\\\\\'s civil war, which broke out in 2011.

One of the report\\\\\\'s authors called it a \"smoking gun\" proving the use of torture. But Assad has steadfastly maintained that many of the accusations leveled against him are politically motivated. \"I\\\\\\'m just a headline -- the bad president, the bad guy, who is killing the good guys,\" Assad told a group of western visitors, including The New York Times, in November. \"You know this narrative.

The performance in the fourth quarter bucked the trend of decline for the first time in the past two years. Industrial production grew steadily last year, with high-tech industry rising by 10.8 percent year-on-year. The economic structure also improved, with the service sector accounting for 51.6 percent of the total GDP, according to NBS data. Second-child policy increases births by 7.9% The universal second-child policy implemented early last year was a major factor in raising the number of births in China to 17.86 million last year, an increase of 7.9 percent and the highest annual number since since 2000, according to the top health authority. The number of newborns has increased by 1.31 million compared with 2015. The portion of the births to couples who already had at least one child rose quickly to at least 45 percent last year, Yang Wenzhuang, a division director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference.   - Premier Li Keqiang meets with Scottish-American chemist Sir James Fraser Stoddart, winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize in chemistry, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Wu Zhiyi / China Daily  (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page2)\\'\\n \\'As Trump calls on manufacturers to return to the US, what are the prospects for China\\\\\\'s industrial strategy? Where next for manufacturing? The geographic location of factories and production has become one of the more hotly debated issues in recent months. At an executive meeting of the Chinese State Council, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Dec 28, a guideline was issued to encourage more foreign investment in high-end manufacturing in China. This would underpin the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy for the country to become a global leader in such areas as rail transport, robotics, motorcycles and industrial design within the next decade.    Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has called upon US manufacturers to return their production from China and elsewhere to the United States to create jobs there. Ford has already canceled plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and will build one in the US instead. Arguably, with labor costs (once the primary driver for offshoring) now a smaller component of overall production costs because of increased automation, manufacturing is becoming increasingly mobile and can be located in developed countries with higher labor costs. In October, Fuyao, the Chinese autoglass maker, opened the world\\\\\\'s biggest glass plant in Moraine, Ohio, where labor costs are eight times higher than in China. It wants to get a larger slice of the US market and some believe that this might be part of a trend of Chinese manufacturers playing a role in Trump\\\\\\'s so-called jobs revolution. The Chinese government wants its own companies to invest in manufacturing in China, partly to stem the flow of capital out of the country which has a weakening effect on the country\\\\\\'s currency. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a notice in January saying it was to monitor overseas investment by state-owned companies in certain sectors.    Peter Williamson, professor of international management at Cambridge University\\\\\\'s Judge Business School, says China is aiming to build an advanced high-end manufacturing sector which will be a core platform for the overall economy. \"It knows full well it can\\\\\\'t build a high-income economy based on low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing,\" he says \"It needs to build a more high-value industrial base, some of which it will be able to do itself, but some of it will rely on investment by foreign companies.\" Williamson, a leading expert on Chinese innovation, believes China will have little difficulty attracting such investment. \"One of the advantages of the Chinese market is that it is the fastest growing, and in many cases the biggest, market in the world. If you take a company like Apple, almost a quarter of its profits and almost all the growth in its volume came from China.\" Eric Thun, the Peter Moores associate professor in Chinese Business Studies at Oxford University\\\\\\'s Said Business School, says that despite progress there are still challenges for China in upgrading its industry. He cites the semi conductor industry, which receives large government subsidies but is still heavily reliant on imported chips - in particular from the US - for its high-end gadgets. \"There are still limitations as to what Chinese semiconductor companies can do,\" says Thun. The American academic, who is an authority on the China automotive sector, says there have been challenges in the past in opening up these new sectors for investment. \"Sometimes it has worked and sometimes it hasn\\\\\\'t. There have been these concerns in the international business community over the past couple of years about uncertainty,\" he says. \"There is frustration that the government wants to loosen things up for investment in some areas but makes it difficult for everyone else in others.\" Whether the new US administration succeeds in persuading more of its native companies to base their operations back in their homeland remains to be seen. There is, however, already an established trend for companies moving some of their activities back. According to research by the non-profit organization Reshoring Initiative, some 249,000 jobs were moved back in the five years up to the end of 2015. This was more than the 220,000 that left between 2000 to 2003, seen as the peak period for offshoring globally. He Weiwen, vice-president and senior fellow of the Center for China and Globalization, China\\\\\\'s leading independent think tank, believes there is a limit on what can be moved back. He points to US Department of Commerce statistics, which show that the value added per employee for US multinational overseas operations is 29 percent higher than that within the US. \"The only way to bridge that would be for Trump to cut the corporation tax rate from 35 to 20 percent and then impose a 10 percent tariff on goods of these companies coming back into the US. That would still not account for the higher medicare and legal costs involved in employing people in the US,\" he says. \"All this, however, would be a major violation of World Trade Organization rules.\"    He, a former economic and commercial counselor at the Chinese Consulate General in New York and San Francisco, believes it will be a challenge to get US companies to invest more in Chinese manufacturing. \"In my exchanges with American businesses in China, they are not concerned with manufacturing, but getting more access to services, not only financial services like banking and insurance but also legal consulting, leisure and medical services.\" Williamson at Cambridge, who was speaking from Switzerland after attending the Davos forum, says the problem with some of the current debate is that it is couched in terms of manufacturing still being vertically integrated and companies doing everything in one location. He says that model began to die out in the 1990s - driven to a large degree by China - and now the whole production system is built on global supply chains. \"When Donald Trump talks about bringing manufacturing back, what exactly is he talking about? The real question is what bits of this complex global supply chain can be moved and the economics are going to be different depending on which part of the chain you are taking about because some bits are capital-intensive and some labor-intensive.\" \"It would be quite some paradox if the bit that gets moved back to the US is the final assembly operation.\" Fuyao was not the first Chinese manufacturer to set up a production facility in the US. Wanxiang Group, based in Hangzhou, has made a series of acquisitions in the US, including buying bankrupt A123 Systems, a battery maker, for $256 million. Edward Tse, chairman and founder of Gao Feng Advisory, the management consultancy, says a pattern is emerging of Chinese companies doing relatively low-end manufacturing in the US and buying up high-end facilities in Europe. \"We have had a lot of clients come to us looking to make acquisitions in the US, particularly in automotive parts, consumer retail and areas like building materials,\" he says. \"When it comes to areas like high-end manufacturing, they are looking to make acquisitions in Germany, the UK and places like Switzerland and Austria.\" Tse, author of The China Strategy, says this separation has emerged mainly because of US resistance to Chinese technology companies like telecommunications giant Huawei making investments in the US. \"What you are seeing instead is Chinese money in start-up investments in Silicon Valley, Seattle and on the east coast around Boston and Cambridge. They are often part American and part Chinese ventures and because they are small, they are subject to much less scrutiny.\" Jeffrey Towson, professor of investment at Peking University\\\\\\'s Guanghua School of Management, says even if there is a major wave of Chinese manufacturing investments in the Rust Belt or major reshoring by US companies, it is unlikely to create the jobs that Trump craves. \"The biggest impact on manufacturing jobs in the US has not been offshoring to Asia or China but the advance of technology,\" he says. \"It is wiping out jobs far faster than offshoring ever did. It is going to be an increasing phenomenon and is not a trend that will reverse itself.\" Thun at Said Business School believes China is following the right strategy in trying to upgrade its manufacturing by partnering with foreign firms. \"This has so far involved acquiring German firms. There is some concern in Germany about losing their crown jewels, particularly the family-owned mittelstadt (small to medium-sized) companies which are often willing to sell out.\" \"For China to be successful in high-end manufacturing, they need to acquire some of these German institutional and educational structures that promote this type of precision engineering. If you can\\\\\\'t beat them at their own game, you can always acquire them,\" he says. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn             (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page1)\\'\\n \\'For Cui Yanbing, the fruit platter on the table of the guest room is an apt metaphor for the existence of those who live on the island of Vommuli, in the central western Maldives, including hers. \"The fruit you see here comes from all over the world,\" she says, pointing to the lemon, plum and passion fruit, none native to the island country. Cui, who goes by her English name Ice, first came to the Maldives in October 2013. \"It was part my own choice, part destiny,\" says the 24-year-old, who was first hired by a photo studio in Dubai in 2012.   Luxury hotel St. Regis at Vommuli Island in the central western Maldives. Photos by Zhao Xu / China Daily; Lin Xiaoli, Wong Chiu Man, Fan Qianyi / For China Daily        \"My job was to try to persuade customers to pay for touristy pictures taken of them with, and sometimes without, their consent. I hated the fact I had to be pushy all the time and asked to leave after a mere six months.\" But it was not as easy as she had thought. The company, which had paid her relocation expenses, wanted its money back. \"There was a second choice - to go to the Maldives.\" So she went. And despite having no experience with a camera, she found herself behind the shutter, snapping pictures for tourists, many of them Chinese. The work continued for some time before Cui landed another job as a receptionist at a luxury hotel. When the St. Regis announced its pre-opening last October, Cui joined the team as the hotel\\\\\\'s only Chinese butler. \"In a way, I feel that I\\\\\\'ve been carried to the shore of the Maldives, and to Vommuli, by the current of fate.\" Yet it has also been an upstream swim - the position of butler is considered much more challenging and is, of course, higher-paid than that of a receptionist. People come to the Maldives to relax and be free of worries. But for those who are here for a living, the daily problems, from overcoming language barriers to battling loneliness, often teem below the surface. \"My English vocabulary was very limited when I first came,\" Cui says. \"Now I have absolutely no problem communicating with my English-speaking clients and colleagues. The secret? Before, I learned by brain; now I learn by heart.\"  Apart from Cui, the St. Regis Hotel at Vommuli has a guest experience manager and a dive center coach who are also Chinese. The hotel\\\\\\'s spa has one masseuse who is Chinese Malaysian, and when I was there in early December, the hotel had also invited a Chinese chef from the St. Regis Shenzhen to work with local chefs on Chinese cuisine with a twist. Xue Rui, the associate director of St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, Greater China, says the hotel management clearly has its high-end Chinese customers in mind. \"It\\\\\\'s true that the Maldives, the country of a thousand islands, has myriad choices, and the bulk of Chinese customers still head for middle-priced destinations. However, we believe in the potential the Chinese market holds for luxury travel.\" Fan Qianyi, 37, is the Chinese dive center coach. A former merchandiser bitten by the travel bug, she decided to be a coach not long after she learned diving. Over the past few years, the job has taken her to some of the world\\\\\\'s most beautiful beaches, from Thailand and Malaysia to the Maldives. \"The Maldives is different from all the rest, in the sense that the islands are all very separated. The result is a rather encapsulated way of existence that can in some ways wear you down.\" Fan reckons that these days there are about 60 Chinese diving coaches in the Maldives, of whom she knows about 25. \"Since we live on different islands we don\\\\\\'t see each other very often.\" Indeed, friendships made in this part of the world are subject to change from the very beginning, as Cui has learned over the past year or so. \"In the Maldives, we usually have one hotel for one island. So a change of job usually involves island hopping,\" says Cui, who shares one bedroom with three of her workmates at the St. Regis. \"When I went to Dubai, 10 girls from the same tourism school went with me. Three of us eventually came here. Now I\\\\\\'m the only one who\\\\\\'s still here.\" And Fan believes that in the Maldives, the constant sense of fluidity inevitably seeps into relationships that elsewhere would probably have lasted longer. \"Romance does blossom here but is often short-lived. I\\\\\\'ve seen as many marriages (often involving a foreign woman and a Maldivian man) end up as divorces. To be frank, the Maldives is probably one of the most open Muslim countries.\" Asked what she does in her spare time, Fan, whose contact with the wind and the sea is burnished on her face, smiles and says: \"Gossip. This is a small place.\" Once every year she spends time with her husband, who introduced her to scuba diving, outside the Maldives. \"He has only come here once, because I need have to go somewhere else.\" The couple plans to migrate to Australia, where Fan can do scuba diving and more. \"For me, the Maldives is a free long holiday; too long, I\\\\\\'m afraid.\" For Cui, who has an older brother, the pressure is mounting. \"When I first left China, in April 2013, I promised my parents that I would return within two years, a promise that has been broken.\" She went back to her home in Henan province, central China, and stayed for about three months between May and August last year. Her father underwent a minor operation. \"One thing that\\\\\\'s constantly on my mind is my parents\\\\\\' medical expenses - they are OK now, but there may come a day when they need costly treatment. I\\\\\\'ve seen people left untreated for financial reasons. And I decided that this is not going to happen to my parents.\"  Almost all the money she has earned in the Maldives has gone into her savings account, she says. The monthly income, including salaries and tips, is usually between 7,000 yuan ($1,022.7; 951.3 euros; 822.7) and 10,000 yuan. \"It\\\\\\'s easier to save here because you don\\\\\\'t have many places to spend on a tiny island. \"I\\\\\\'ve asked my parents to come, but they didn\\\\\\'t want to, worrying about the cost. When they became aware that here we commute in boats and sea planes instead of buses, they became seriously worried about me.\" With the full knowledge that in a few years she will be back in China - probably her hometown, where a suitable marriage and a stable life awaits - Cui believes that the Maldives has given her much more than better English and darker skin. \"My birthday is in October, so when my last birthday came, I had just joined the St. Regis. I expected nothing, but my work mates and friends gave me the biggest surprise,\" she says, beaming. \"They handmade a birthday cake, sang Happy Birthday to me in Chinese and, in a typical Maldivian way of celebrating a birthday, threw me into the sea. \"This is going to be my last stop in the Maldives.\" When Cui first left China, she was a second-year student at a Beijing occupational school for would-be tour guides. \"To be honest, attending that school was more about paying money for a certificate than about receiving a quality education, so I quit as soon as the right opportunity came up.\" What sounds like a natural choice today must have been a bold move for a 21-year-old who had never been abroad before. The Maldives, despite its soothing calmness, is in fact for dreamers and risk-takers, those who dare to live differently. Fan the diving coach knows all about that. \"For the Maldives, each one of us is merely a passing ship, but as we do so the ocean waves leave their mark. Under Maldives law you\\\\\\'re not allowed to take anything away from this country, not even a tiny branch of dead coral. For me, a net full of memories is more than enough.\" zhaoxu@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page1)\\'\\n \"Instead of opponents, the two nations could be partners assisting the Trump administration in achieving its stated aims On Jan 20, Donald Trump took the oath of office and was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, but his aggressive remarks on economics, trade and geopolitics add more uncertainty - even potential tension - to Sino-US relations. In fact, the two countries are major trading partners and according the research Report on Chinese Enterprises Globalization - published by the Center for China and Globalization, China has become a net capital exporter for the first time. In 2015, China\\'s total direct investment to the US exceeded the FDI amount from the US to China for the first time. Also, China-US bilateral investment has experienced a rapid increase in the past few decades. This astonishing development has resulted in an immense spillover effect for both countries, promoting domestic employment, upgrading technological development and stimulating industrial restructuring. Thus, the two countries should prioritize economic diplomacy and seek more opportunities for collaboration. To make America great again, Trump has promised to bring manufacturing companies back to US, and increase infrastructure investment to create more jobs for unemployed Americans. In this case, China is probably the best partner America can have to help it achieve its ambitions. It is believed that during Trump\\'s administration, policy initiatives will be heavily deployed to revitalize American manufacturing and bring jobs back to the country. Whether Trump will be successful in his attempt to encourage more manufacturing companies to move operations to the US depends not only on re-shoring but also on Chinese manufacturers. These manufacturers might be a solution to Trump\\'s Rust Belt jobs problem. CCG\\'s research shows that, while sectors for China\\'s outbound investment are quite diversified, manufacturing comes out first. And, most importantly, private enterprises have become the main force for outbound investment. More private enterprises have gone up to the high-end of global value chain. Last year, I was invited as a guest to attend Fuyao Glass America\\'s opening ceremony for its newest US facility in Moraine, Ohio. This investment accounts for $450 million, which represents the largest Chinese investment in Ohio and the eighth largest direct foreign investment in the US in the past decade. Currently, this factory employs about 2,000 people and expects to recruit 300-500 people more by the end of 2017. As is planned, this investment will be enlarged to $1 billion and create 5,000 jobs for local people. Fuyao Glass is not the only enterprise that is committed to investing in the US. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions are a growing trend and have become the main focus of Chinese companies\\' outbound investment. Resources, technology, brands and market channels are the main motivations for cross-border M&A. In January 2016, Chinese home appliance maker Haier Group made a deal to buy General Electric Co\\'s appliance business for $5.4 billion. This month, Jack Ma, Alibaba executive chairman, met Trump and laid out the Chinese e-commerce giant\\'s new plan that could create 1 million jobs for small US businesses over the next five years. Another way for Trump to create more jobs is through an infrastructure revamp. This is a chance for China to play a role, since it has a great deal of experience in infrastructure construction. China can also invite the US to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. China can work with the US to foster a stronger and wider collaboration in infrastructure construction, involving the US, including by jointly exploring markets in other countries. The Chinese government recently announced a series of reforms to improve the overall investment climate, including both market access and regulation, which inevitably compete with Trump\\'s initiatives for attracting investment. The two countries still have a great potential for collaboration, and China seems the best choice as a partner to help the US become a great power again.

Via: Daily Mail  \\'\\n \\'Trump\\\\\\'s recent pronouncements about auto imports and NAFTA may knock out nation\\\\\\'s biggest competition When it comes to the United States market, Chinese and Mexican manufacturers have long been rivals. Both groups export fairly similar types of goods. Both have advantages in lower labor costs. And they are now the No 1 and No 2 exporters to the US. In most sectors, whether it is toys or laptops, Chinese manufacturers have become dominant. However, in a few key sectors, most notably cars and autoparts, Mexican manufacturers have been more successful, and most frequently because of the North American Free Trade Agreement. That is why US President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s statements about wanting to renegotiate or dismantle NAFTA and US-Mexico trade are so important. This could be very bad for Mexican manufacturers but possibly quite good for China. Either way, it looks like it will change the existing dynamic. My argument for this is three points: Point 1: In the US market, Chinese manufacturers have consistently beaten Mexican manufacturers. The types of exports coming from China and Mexico are fairly similar. In 2015, electronic equipment was 26 percent of China\\\\\\'s exports (about $600 billion) and 21 percent of Mexico\\\\\\'s (about $81 billion). Machines, engines and pumps were 16 percent of China\\\\\\'s ($364 billion) and 16 percent of Mexico\\\\\\'s ($59 billion). The other major categories such as furniture, lighting, signs; plastics; and medical and technical equipment are also similar between the two countries. The biggest differences you see between Chinese and Mexican exports are in oil and vehicles. And what is most noticeable is that China\\\\\\'s exports in almost all of these sectors now dwarf Mexico\\\\\\'s. This was not the case 15 years ago. In 2000, Mexico was already six years into the enactment of NAFTA but China had yet to join the World Trade Organization. According to the US Census Bureau, Mexico\\\\\\'s exports to the US totaled $136 billion in 2000. At the same time, China\\\\\\'s exports to the US were $100 billion. Yet by 2010, China\\\\\\'s exports to the US had soared to $365 billion, far surpassing Mexico at $230 billion. Also during 2000 to 2006, Mexico\\\\\\'s export growth rate fell to 6 percent, from its previous 15 percent during 1995-2000 and prior to China joining the WTO. In 2016, China\\\\\\'s exports to the US reached $423 billion, compared with $271 billion from Mexico. One can certainly argue that Mexico was actually increasing in overall exports to the US during this period. China was just doing better. However, the quote that comes to mind is by Warren Buffett\\\\\\'s partner Charlie Munger, who said: \"At Berkshire Hathaway, we do not like to compete against Chinese manufacturers.\" Mexican manufacturers probably now say the same thing. Point 2: A big exception to this trend is in cars and autoparts, where Mexican manufacturers have done consistently better. The biggest exception to this China and Mexico export story is in vehicles and autoparts. In 2016, Mexican global exports in this sector reached $90 billion, making it the country\\\\\\'s single largest export at 23.7 percent. And the US was the primary destination for a rapidly growing autoparts-automotive industry. In contrast, China\\\\\\'s global exports in this space represented only 2.7 percent of their exports, and totalled $62.7 billion. The reasons for this are, unsurprisingly, NAFTA and Mexico\\\\\\'s close proximity to the US. It is simply much cheaper to transport cars and other heavy items from Mexico to the US and most final car assembly is done close to market. However, autoparts have less of a geographic factor and there is fairly complicated movement of parts, components and various stages of assembly across Mexico, America and Canada. NAFTA is the other factor, which has removed most trade and investment barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico. Virtually all of the major automakers have now centralized some or all of their production for North America to Mexico. Today, the importance of the automobile-auto parts industry to Mexico cannot be overstated. It is the country\\\\\\'s single biggest export and source of dollars (now surpassing money sent home by migrants to the US). Mexican car production has reached record numbers with more than 3 million cars produced each year. Automobile-autoparts are also one of the biggest drivers for foreign investment into the country. Since 2010, nine of the major automakers have announced more than $24 billion in investments in Mexico, with most targeting the US as their primary end-market. Point 3: US President Trump may now be changing NAFTA and the rules of US-Mexican trade. This could be very good for Chinese manufacturers. US President Trump\\\\\\'s recent announcements of an intended renegotiation or cancellation of NAFTA have sent shockwaves through Mexico. More than 70-80 percent of all Mexican exports are going to the US and Canada (i.e., the NAFTA members). And what\\\\\\'s worse, Trump has specifically focused on Mexican produced automobiles and auto parts, one of the most rapidly growing areas of Mexican manufacturing. Trump has specifically called for a 35 percent tax on cars imported from Mexico. Trump has also already criticized Ford, General Motors and Toyota for moving facilities to Mexico and has stated they will have to pay this 35 percent tax to bring their cars into the US. Ford had the unfortunate luck of announcing an end to all of their US production of small cars in the middle of the election, which got a response from candidate Trump. Ford have now canceled their planned $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Without question, the potential for upcoming changes to NAFTA and car imports is already having a chilling effect on investment into Mexico. However, for Chinese manufacturers this could be a positive development. For them, this looks like their biggest competitor for exports to the US may be about to lose its biggest advantage, a largely tariff-free border. Plus, Mexican exports to the US are heavily weighted to automobile-auto parts, the area Trump is focusing most on. For China, broad changes to NAFTA could result in a leveling of the playing field in certain sectors in terms of tariffs. It is also worth noting that Chinese manufacturers have already been catching up with Mexican manufacturers in automobile-auto parts, just as they have in most other industries. In 2014, China passed Canada and became the second-largest exporter of automotive parts into the US after Mexico. Even before the recent comments, Mexican manufacturers were worried that China might be granted a lower tariff. Ultimately, there are a lot factors in each sub-sector when it comes to trade, whether its tariffs, shipping costs, changing currencies or others. So it\\\\\\'s difficult to generalize too much when it comes to Mexico and Chinese manufacturers. However, we can conclude that Trump\\\\\\'s recent pronouncements about auto imports and NAFTA are much worse for Mexico than China. And they raise a very intriguing question: Without NAFTA, can Mexican manufacturers successfully compete with China? The author is the professor of investment, Guanghua School of Management.

The 34-year-old principal for management consultants Roland Berger says there is no logic for companies that have major operations in Asia, and in particular China, to do that. US President Donald Trump has called for American companies to bring their manufacturing operations home.    \"You have, on the one hand, what he wants to come back to the US and on the other hand, the reality of what can actually come back,\" says Ni. So far, only US companies in Mexico have said they are moving some of their operations back. General Motors has announced it is moving 450 jobs back. Ford has axed plans for a $1.6 billion plant in the US-neighboring country, which industry sources claim was never going to get the final go-ahead anyway. Ni, speaking at his company\\\\\\'s offices in Gateway Plaza, Beijing, says it would be highly damaging for some of his clients to up sticks from China and move back to the US. He highlights the US chemicals company Cabot, which has been in China for 30 years and set up a joint venture with Hengyecheng in Wuhai in Inner Mongolia in September last year to make silica. The new investment will create many thousands of jobs. \"It has done a considerable amount of work on that project, including building a strong relationship with the local government. Why would it have to close that plant and rebuild another one in the US? It would just be illogical.\" He says Cabot, which has other hubs in Tianjin and Shanghai, is a prime example of a modern US multinational company, with 80 percent of its revenues coming from overseas. \"Its growth is driven by Asia, primarily by China. The American market is not really a growth area for the company.\" Ni believes Chinese autoglass maker Fuyao\\\\\\'s decision to set up an operation in Moraine, Ohio, in October was driven by very specific factors. The Volkswagen scandal relating to disguising emission levels is set to boost sales of US cars and therefore autoglass. Fuyao already has a 60 percent share of the China market and needs to find markets outside the country. \"The economic advantages relate to energy costs, such as natural gas, being between a third and half the price they are in China. They are getting the land almost free. The labor costs, however, are almost eight times those of China.\" Ni argues it is not just the cost of labor that is likely to stop a flood of China manufacturers switching operations to the US, but also the lack of skills now available. Cao Dewang, founder and chairman of Fuayo, has admitted that he has had to employ mainly people over the age of 50. \"He can hardly find any young working adults suitable for such blue collar jobs. This is because the industrial landscape has changed and is now very much service-orientated rather than production-orientated so there aren\\\\\\'t the young people with these skills anymore.\" Ni also cannot envisage Trump getting the steel mills in Pittsburgh rolling again, with the Pennsylvanian city now more noted for its robotics industry. \"We no longer talk about American companies in the steel sector, to be honest. It is either Japanese, Chinese or European ones in high-end steel production.\" Ni, who was born in Harbin but moved to Singapore as a teenager, studied electrical engineering at the National University of Singapore before doing his master\\\\\\'s at MIT in the US. He began his career in investment banking with Credit Suisse in Singapore before going to study for an MBA at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France. He joined Roland Berger - one of the few international management consultancy firms that has developed out of Europe, rather than the US - in 2011 and now works for a wide range of clients in industrial goods, packaging, steel, utilities and energy. Ni believes that instead of manufacturing migrating out of China, it is now more likely to remain at home, given the current emphasis on developing a high-end manufacturing sector. The State Council issued a guideline in December aimed at attracting more foreign investment in manufacturing. \"In China you have access to a more talented, highly skilled and comparatively cheaper labor force. China has transformed from low-cost production to a technologically-driven and technically intensive economy. The Government has achieved this by investing heavily in research and development,\" he says. Ni believes there is now a major opportunity for early stage European start-up companies, in particular, to come to China to develop their products. \"This does not just apply in manufacturing, but more generally. There is just a bigger market to test any concept with. In the past, companies might have tested their products in Sweden and the Nordic region, with access to 20 million people, before taking them to Western Europe. In China, they can do this on a much bigger scale.\" The consultant says that any reservations companies may have had in the past about intellectual property protection are no longer as relevant. \"They can come to China earlier and patent their product and then continue to upgrade it to make sure the application is not being copied later on.\" Ni thinks some of China\\\\\\'s low-end manufacturing will continue to move to South East Asian destinations like Thailand, Vietnam and Laos but believes it will be at least another generation before it moves to Africa. \"In Africa, you have mining and some consumer-related enterprises but you don\\\\\\'t have a fully established industry-related infrastructure. You have the production of shoes and apparel but no more than that,\" he says. \"I would be confident that in 10 to 20 years you will see an automotive hub there.\" Ni believes the real activity, however, will be in China, which is now building many advantages over the US. \"China has everything the US can offer to develop high-end industrial activity. There is a big market, which is potentially more dynamic. Even in areas like technology, you have major successes such as Didi (the China taxi-hailing service), which has now merged its operations with Uber,\" he says. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page7)\\'\\n \\'Owing to a lack of funding, experience and resources, it is really difficult for young entrepreneurs to operate their businesses at the beginning . . .

The product is said to meet the growing need for animal protein driven by fast-growing demand for meat in China. Jean-Marc Dublanc, CEO of Bluestar Adisseo Company, says the fast-growing demand for safe and nutritious food, plus fluctuating prices of animal feed products, including wheat and corn, are requiring animal nutrition solution providers to offer products with higher efficiency, safety and quality. Adisseo is the world\\\\\\'s second-largest provider of methionine, with a market share of 27 percent. The company went public in Shanghai in 2015, the first European company to be listed on the A-share market. Its plant in Nanjing, in East China\\\\\\'s Jiangsu province, is one of the group\\\\\\'s largest facilities globally. About 47 percent of products produced in the plant are exported to other countries. China is currently Adisseo\\\\\\'s largest market by sales revenue. \"We aim to offer high added-value services to help our clients gain precise animal nutrition solutions. Our consultancy-based analysis helps clients understand their specific needs and get customized feeding solutions for animal nutrition,\" said Dublanc. In this way, clients can reduce and better control their costs, and use animal nutrition products safely and correctly. This also helps to secure the safety of the entire food supply chain. Products such as probiotics can be used to replace some antibiotics. This may help reduce overuse of antibiotics in animal feeding and cut the risk of harm to end consumers, says Dublanc. Adisseo is also open to growth opportunities outside organic growth, such as strategic mergers or acquisitions, technology alliances and partnerships in China and globally, says Dublanc. The compound annual growth rate of global market demand for methionine has been about 6 percent since 2013. China\\\\\\'s market demand is growing faster, at 7 to 10 percent, according to data from FoodInfo, an information services provider focusing on the food industry. China\\\\\\'s demands for meat protein have risen more than 50 percent in the past 10 years, and annual demand for animal feed is about 600 million metric tons, pushing up demand for animal nutrition products, according to research from the China Animal Feeding Information Network. wuyiyao@chinadail.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page29)\\'\\n \\'- Visitors to a high-speed railway exhibition examine a model of a China Railway High-speed train.

SinoFortone first made a name for itself in the UK during President Xi Jinping\\\\\\'s 2015 state visit by announcing an investment of 2 billion ($2.5 billion; 2.3 billion euros) in two biomass power stations in Wales, and 100 million in London\\\\\\'s new Paramount entertainment park. Since then, it has signed a deal with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to lead a Chinese consortium to invest 10 billion in Scotland\\\\\\'s infrastructure.   - SinoFortone has invested in a renewable power plant in Anglesey, Wales. Provided to China Daily  \"We are confident about the UK\\\\\\'s investment opportunities despite short-term Brexit uncertainties,\" says Peter Zhang, chief executive of SinoFortone. \"In the UK we would focus our investment strategy on renewable energy projects and social housing, as those sectors require more investment, provide desirable revenue return and have turnaround time periods that suit our investment agenda.\" Although returns on infrastructure projects vary, Zhang says on average they can generate about 8 percent return on capital, which is not high compared with projects in emerging markets. \"Instead of looking for immediate financial returns, we are more concerned with building our reputation in the UK, gaining experience in this mature market and using our UK resources and enhanced brand image to grow into other international markets,\" Zhang says. Sinofortone is a joint venture between Sinolinks Group and Liaoning Fortone Group. Liaoning Fortone is a private construction business in Shenyang that focuses on investment in large-scale projects and becoming a construction partner in those projects. Sinolinks is a Chinese company focusing on asset and fund management, commodity trading and mining. Capital is one advantage it has in the UK\\\\\\'s current infrastructure and housing investment market. Its ability to source cost-effective materials in the supply chain from China is another core advantage. The UK\\\\\\'s public sector strain on infrastructure capital has been exacerbated by the British public\\\\\\'s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, meaning the UK may no longer be eligible for valuable European infrastructure funds.    The UK may lose eligibility for the so-called Juncker Plan, which aims to unlock 315 billion euros ($334 billion; 270 billion) of infrastructure investment between 2015 and 2017. Currently, the plan includes eight major UK projects worth a total of 8.2 billion euros, which could create more than 70,000 jobs. Whether the funding continues will depend on the UK-EU exit negotiations. In that context, the British government is eager to attract Chinese funds. During the eighth Economic and Finance Dialogue in London in November, it showcased 13 projects offering more than 5 billion in investment opportunities to Chinese investors. Concerns emerged after China General Nuclear finally inked its agreement to invest in the UK\\\\\\'s Hinkley Nuclear power station in October and the new British government led by Prime Minister Theresa May announced new rules for scrutinizing foreign investment in infrastructure projects that involve national security, but Zhang is not worried. \"Our investment mostly focuses on renewable energy, like wind, solar, waste-to-energy and biomass, which have no national security concerns, unlike nuclear,\" Zhang says. In addition to capital investment, SinoFortone also helps European projects become more cost effective through sourcing equipment from China, which could cut material costs 30 to 50 percent, Zhang says. The two biomass power stations will generate up to 299 megawatts of power each, and will be built using technology from British partner Orthios Eco Parks, which developed the innovative technology to create electricity from plants. So far in 2016 Orthios and Zhang\\\\\\'s team have raised 30 million in the UK from bond issuance, which is already invested in the initial phases of the power station.    Currently, factory construction does not have a timeline, as it is waiting for the UK government\\\\\\'s Contract for Difference auction - an energy subsidy allocation process, which was delayed by the Brexit vote from 2016 to spring 2017. It is a standard process wherein the government subsidizes the price difference between what consumers pay and what power companies charge to make their investment profitable. \"Once we start construction, the power station can become operational in two years,\" Zhang says. Construction for the second biomass power station in Wales, in Port Talbot, will begin once the Anglesey power plant is complete. Despite the Anglesey delay, SinoFortone\\\\\\'s involvement in renewable energy has secured it opportunities to negotiate deals with various governments for infrastructure investment, including Kazakhstan, Greece, Georgia, Angola, Guinea and Pakistan. \"Securing the UK renewable energy deals helped us establish a good reputation and greatly helped push forward those deals in Africa and in the Belt and Road countries, where we could also play a role in bringing advanced UK technology,\" Zhang says. SinoFortone\\\\\\'s investment in the two biomass plants is welcomed by Orthios, though the fact that the technology was unproven in the market had made fundraising difficult. Orthios was founded over a decade ago by Sean McCormick, an architect, and Lewis LeVasseur, an engineer. Orthios had already secured planning permission and relevant approvals before SinoFortone joined the project. \"We have spent five years researching and developing this model, and the investment from China will help us roll it out across the planet,\" says McCormick, chief executive of Orthios. China\\\\\\'s focus on green energy and its ability to take a long-term view was instrumental in securing the deal, McCormick says, adding that the two biomass plants combined will create 1,000 full-time jobs, as well as thousands of jobs during the construction phase. Industry analysts see the collaboration as a win-win for both the Chinese and British sides. Danae Kyriakopoulou, head of research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank, says SinoFortone\\\\\\'s investment in Wales is an important example of how China is increasingly using its resources to invest in high-innovation, knowledge-driven economies. \"Appropriately for an economy in the phase of industrialization, China has traditionally focused its investment on resource-rich economies that have in exchange provided it with the raw materials it needed to fuel its development,\" Kyriakopoulou says. \"However, China is now looking beyond the purely financial returns on investment as it seeks to move up the ladder in the global chain of value-added.\" In March, SinoFortone led a Chinese consortium to sign an agreement with the Scottish government to invest 10 billion in Scotland\\\\\\'s infrastructure, covering projects in transportation, power stations and social housing. China Railway No 3 Engineering Group is also part of the consortium and is expected to provide technical support. \"We saw market demand in Scotland for those new infrastructure projects, so we wanted to help the Scottish government fulfill those demands,\" Zhang says. \"Our advantage in engaging with those projects is our capital investment and our ability to bring Chinese elements.\" One example of Chinese construction techniques to be deployed in Scotland is prefabricated modular housing, which could be 30 percent more cost effective than on-site construction. In addition to infrastructure projects, SinoFortone is also increasingly engaging with the UK\\\\\\'s tourism market, riding an increasing number of Chinese visitors.

Peng was then based in Zhengzhou, Henan province. Little did he realize that financial innovation, brought about by the liberalization of financial services and the advent of new Chinese private sector banks in offline and online channels, would help him to expand his business to men\\\\\\'s and women\\\\\\'s clothing. Peng\\\\\\'s business expansion in subsequent years was a result of online shopping giant Alibaba\\\\\\'s 2010 decision to offer easy loans to merchants on Taobao. As one of the first group of traders who received loans, he borrowed 5,000 yuan ($719; 677 euros; 596) with sales orders for collateral. Later, he relocated to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, rented a 140 square meter apartment and hired a few hands to run the business. Again, it was Alibaba\\\\\\'s loan that made it possible. This time round, the loan was much bigger: 100,000 yuan. When Ant Financial, an Alibaba subsidiary, launched an online private bank called MYbank in 2015, Peng received a credit quota of 1 million yuan. Based on his previous record, he did not have to pledge anything or offer any collateral to MYbank. That emboldened him to become ambitious. He wanted to launch his own clothing brand, outgrowing the sales-only phase of his business. So he spoke to a loan officer of MYbank about a possible bigger loan. MYbank assessed risks using big data analysis and decided to increase his credit limit to 2 million yuan. That helped Peng to contract a small clothing factory, hire five fashion designers and more than 10 employees. He also rented a 1,000-square-meter office and a warehouse of the same size in Hangzhou. \"Our company is still very small. But, just like Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, I also want to run a business for 102 years,\" he says. He adds: \"And do a lot of things\". He already owns a clothing brand and will open an offline store next. Peng\\\\\\'s success is as much a tribute to his can-do spirit as it is a shining example of MYbank\\\\\\'s effectiveness in China\\\\\\'s liberalized banking industry. As an online bank (with no offline branches), it relies on internet technologies like big data and cloud computing to make lending decisions, and assess and manage risks. It has positioned itself as a specialist in all things small - that is, its deposits, loans and customers (mainly self-owned businesses, farmers and startups founded by college students in rural areas) are all small. By the end of November, MYbank had served more than 2 million micro and small enterprises, lending each 15,000 yuan on average. Its loan balance was 25.4 billion yuan, up 243 percent from the beginning of last year. Starting in June 2016, it also began offering micro and small business owners a free online product that analyzes financial data of their business thoroughly. This means, they no longer have to make rough calculations of their profits or losses. Currently, 500,000 micro and small enterprises are benefitting from the product. That is all in stark contrast to the past. This change in China\\\\\\'s financial services sector began with the launch of a trial program in 2014 to set up the first five private banks, including MYbank. The China Banking Regulatory Commission has gradually accelerated approvals for the establishment of such banks. As of Jan 10, the CBRC has approved 17 private banks. Seven of them have opened for business already. Among the new kids on the banking block are Beijing\\\\\\'s Zhongguancun Bank, named after the area where it is located, also known as China\\\\\\'s \"Silicon Valley\"; and Jiangsu Suning Bank Co Ltd, founded by electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and a few other companies in Jiangsu province. At a news conference on Dec 8, Ling Gan, director of the CBRC\\\\\\'s City Commercial Banks Supervision Department, said the regulator will continue to push forward the orderly establishment of private banks, as long as the applications for banking licenses meet regulatory requirements and the founders are well prepared. \"The first five private banks tried to innovate their models of development and bolster weak spots in the traditional financial sector. They are trying to provide more targeted and more convenient financial services to communities, startup companies, as well as micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,\" Ling said. The CBRC requires private banks to choose a clear market position and make different business strategies from existing banks\\\\\\', based on regional economic factors and their shareholders\\\\\\' resources. The big idea is to modernize the banking system. So, the first five private banks have been reaching out to micro and small businesses or individuals in relatively low-income groups that were neglected by traditional banks. Some of the new banks played to their strengths in e-commerce, social networking or big data, while others exploited their geographical and local policy advantages. For instance, WeBank, an online bank founded by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, launched personal loans ranging from 500 yuan to 300,000 yuan, without asking for any collateral or guarantee. In addition to the consumer credit report provided by China\\\\\\'s central bank, WeBank says it mines information from social networking patterns and online transactions of loan applicants through multipurpose apps WeChat and QQ, which belong to the Tencent stable. In late November, WeBank\\\\\\'s small consumer-loans served more than 60 million people in 549 cities in China, most of whom were not clients of traditional banks.

The mainland\\\\\\'s domestic crude production dropped to 200 million metric tons in 2016 due to high production costs of domestic crude oil at an average of $45-50 (47-42 euros; 36-40) per barrel, higher than the global average, according to the CNPC Economics and Technology Research Institute. Under such circumstances, imported oil was more cost-effective, it said. An analyst said the world\\\\\\'s second-biggest crude oil consumer, to make up for the decline of domestic oil output, will continue the trend to import crude oil from abroad and the dependence on foreign oil was likely to climb further. Li Li, an energy research director at ICIS China, says the country\\\\\\'s foreign oil dependency level might increase to 70 percent by 2020.    \"With the declining global crude oil prices, the country\\\\\\'s major oil giants have all lowered their domestic production and investment, which will lead to a further decrease of domestic crude production,\" says Li. The latest official data indicates that 2016 output of China\\\\\\'s two largest oilfields, Daqing in Heilongjiang province and Shengli in Shandong province, fell by over 5 million tons compared with 2015. Daqing posted crude oil production of 36.56 million tons and Shengli 23.9 million tons, for decreases of 1.826 million and 3.2 million tons, respectively, compared with 2015. That number is expected to further drop in 2017. With no discoveries in recent years, there are concerns that the output reduction of the two major oilfields will lead to a further decline of the country\\\\\\'s domestic crude oil production, the analyst says. However, Li says the agency forecast a slight increase of domestic crude oil production in 2017 following a rebalancing of the global crude oil price. Li says OPEC\\\\\\'s long-sought agreement to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day is seen as bringing equilibrium back to demand and supply. According to the CNPC Economics and Technology Research Institute, the country\\\\\\'s total energy consumption reached around 4.36 billion tons of coal equivalent in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 1.4 percent. The world\\\\\\'s biggest consumer of energy plans to cap total primary energy consumption at around 4.4 billion tons of coal equivalent in 2017, with a further push to use cleaner fuel, according to the National Energy Administration. China\\\\\\'s refined oil consumption reached 313 million tons last year, a 1 percent decrease compared with the same period last year and the first time the refined fuel sector saw a downward trend, it says. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page27)\\'\\n \\'Experts have said the development of homegrown world-class ballpoint pen heads will cut the cost of making the tips by roughly 50 percent. Kui Weiliang, deputy director of the China Ningbo Stationery Association in Ningbo, East China\\\\\\'s Zhejiang province, home to one of the leading Chinese stationery enterprises, Beifa Group, says: \"The average cost of producing a ballpoint pen is about 0.5 yuan (7 cents). The head costs more than 0.1 yuan, which could be decreased to a maximum of 0.05 yuan when the homemade stainless steel products replace imported ones. When it (specialty steel) is mass produced, customers will be able to buy high-quality pens at a lower price.\" However, Zhao Dongmin, who has run the M&G Chenguang Stationery store in Chaoyang district, Beijing, for about five years, says the price of ballpoint pens would not be affected. \"I don\\\\\\'t think the buying and selling price will change,\" Zhao says.  \"The cost saved on materials is likely to be offset by the increasing production and logistical expenses.\" In his store, varieties of ballpoint pens are on display. Prices ranges from 1 to 4.5 yuan. \"Generally, customers tend to pay 2 or 3 yuan for a ballpoint pen. For items as cheap as ballpoint pens, few people will care whether the pen is made in China or not. But the difference in quality will be noticed,\" Zhao says. Since Taiyuan Iron & Steel Co declared its intention to develop the first homegrown stainless steel unit for use in the production of ballpoint pen heads in early January, the topic has garnered more than 7.5 million page views on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform in China. \"The production process for a ballpoint pen head is as complicated as that of a watch.

Fu Yuanlong, deputy director of the National Light Industry Fountain Pen and Ballpoint Pen Testing Center, says ballpoint pen testing has strict standards. \"A qualified ballpoint pen should write 2,000 meters and there should be no broken lines or ink leakage,\" he says. \"The diameter of the ball is no bigger than one millimeter. And it should be matched perfectly with the ball seat to let the ink flow from the gap between.\" Fu says that since the tiny head requires high-precision stainless steel and high-end equipment, China had been importing them from Japan and Switzerland for many years, causing the high production cost.

The opportunity came after the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission said recently that the SOE reform will no longer focus only on cutting the number of groups or their subsidiaries. Industrial upgrading, global market diversification and resource optimization are main focus of the reform this year. Listed companies such as Hunan Valin Steel Co, Jizhong Energy Group Co, Beijing-based Huaneng Power International Inc, Shanghai Electric Power Co and another 10 companies from these three industries all announced that they have been involved in asset reorganization since 2016. He Jingtong, a professor of economics at Nankai University in Tianjin, says that because the steel, coal and power businesses can notably affect SOE profits, the government is keen to integrate these commodity-based sectors to support profit growth, as international commodity prices are gradually picking up.    \"The changing relationship between supply and demand of China\\\\\\'s manufacturing products, the stable business operations of the steel and coal industries, and the central government\\\\\\'s call to cut excessive industrial capacity are all core factors pushing reform in these three industries,\" says Li Jin, a researcher at the Beijing-based China Enterprise Research Institute. The SASAC has set a target to raise the profit growth rate gained by central SOEs to between 3 percent and 6 percent year-on-year in 2017. The sales revenue of central SOEs reached 23.4 trillion yuan ($3.39 trillion) in 2016, up 2.6 percent year-on-year, while they gained 1.23 trillion yuan in profits, increasing 0.5 percent from the previous year, according to the National Business Daily. China has, to date, cut the number of its central SOEs to 102. Local SOE watchdogs in 10 municipalities and provinces including Beijing, Chongqing and Guangdong, have already made plans to further recombine or cut the number of SOEs this year. China has 150,000 SOEs at different levels, which manage more than 100 trillion yuan ($14.5 trillion; 13.6 trillion euros; 11.8 trillion) in assets and employ more than 30 million people. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page28)\\'\\n \\'The Iraqi city of Karbala, where the holy shrine of the third Shia Imam -Imam Hussein- is located, is swarming with millions of devoted Muslims, both Shiites and Sunnis, for mourning rituals marking Arbaeen, known as the largest religious gathering in the world. 15 Shares\\\\n14 0 0 1\\\\nGiven the mainstream mediaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s constant sensationalized reporting on terror and Muslims in the Western world, the utter lack of coverage of Arbaeenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s march on Sunday and Monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful Muslims.\\\\nMonday marked the final day of the mourning for Imam Hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of Yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph.

As a first step, it will require all platforms to deposit 20 percent of clients\\\\\\' funds in appointed bank accounts. The move is the latest step to be taken by the central bank to tackle the financial risks caused by a rising number of institutions found embezzling money. Starting from April 17, a total of 267 third-party organizations with central bank licenses in China, including Alibaba-owned Alipay, will have to submit around 20 percent of provisions to a single account opened in a commercial bank, with the central bank\\\\\\'s approval. Customer provisions refer to money held by third-party organizations that is not the property of the organization. The exact amount handed in by each institution will be calculated based upon the daily average balance of provisions in the previous quarter and will be adjusted quarterly thereafter. \"The 20 percent level aims to leave time for institutions to adapt to new rules,\" says Xie Zhong, head of the central bank\\\\\\'s payment and settlement department. \"The final level will be 100 percent\", meaning the central bank will then be the only authority governing provisions. Xie did not provide a specific timeline for adjusting the level.    The move comes after the central bank decided to establish a clearinghouse for online transactions early last year, aiming to trim financial risks by disconnecting the direct clearing business from third-party payment firms and banks. The clearinghouse, which can be used as an alternative to commercial banks to keep custody of provisions, will be launched in March this year, according to Xie. Li Aijun, a law professor with the China University of Political Science and Law, says the new rules will not have a major impact on the income level of the companies. \"The new rules will hit small institutions that are more vulnerable to financial risks,\" she says. Li says she believes it will not take long for the central bank to increase the level to 100 percent, since risks have emerged quickly in recent years in the ever-expanding market. The third-party online payment market in China attained a total transaction value of 4.65 trillion yuan ($674 billion; 630 billion euros; 546 billion) in the second quarter of 2016, up 6.5 percent quarter-to-quarter according to the latest data from Analysis International. A total of 460 billion yuan of customer provisions has been reserved by third-party institutions as of the third quarter of last year, according to the central bank. By the end of last year, more than 30 third-party institutions were fined for illegally embezzling provisions, data from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences show.

When he landed the job of CEO of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina, one of the world\\\\\\'s five largest dairy companies, he refreshed its strategies and changed it to be a more purpose-driven company. \"Dutch people drink a lot of milk by nature and they have a love for milk. It has been part of their daily lives for many years and we don\\\\\\'t know what life would be without milk,\" he says. \"I joined FrieslandCampina because of what I learned from my previous work. I believed I could help the company to go to a different level. Working for the stakeholders, in this case farmers, is something I appreciate,\" he says.   Roelof Joosten, CEO of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina, says the company primarily focuses on the infant formula market in China. Provided to China Daily  Recently, he spoke to China Daily about the company\\\\\\'s e-commerce expansion plans in China and emerging opportunities in smaller Chinese cities. The following are the edited excerpts of the interview. Do you have any plans to expand in China in the next few years? We obviously want to expand further into infant formula, but we also would like to enlarge the other categories, predominantly food service, cheese and ultra-heat treatment milk. We would like to put more effort into those three categories and diversify our business, but at this time, the most important category to play with is infant formula and we should not lose focus. What are your competitive advantages over other international and Chinese brands? FrieslandCampina is not in the game of volumes, but into value creation. In China, we primarily focus on infant formula, because we believe that we can create a lot of value there in how we control our quality and the safety of our product line. We are one of the few producers who control the full dairy chain, so it\\\\\\'s from grass to glass. Do you mainly target high-income consumers? Overall, we target consumers with higher incomes. For Friso (the company\\\\\\'s high-end infant and toddler formula brand), we still focus on first and second-tier cities in terms of distribution and we can still do a better job on that. For Friso, we can go deeper and wider into the Chinese market and use e-commerce to reach out to other consumers. For example, our cooperation with Suning Commerce Group Co helps us to reach out to those consumers in some third to sixth-tier cities where we don\\\\\\'t have any distribution. In these cities, we also target higher income consumers. In the future, we might reach out to the rural areas.  What\\\\\\'s your growth potential like with the two-child policy in China? The regulatory change has had quite an impact on local producers as well as international producers. With stricter rules, the unprofessional players who take advantage of the opportunities in China have to leave the market. That means there will be a lot of infant formula dumping in 2017, which will distort the market somewhat. I think the market will recover from that in 2018, when the second-child policy kicks in to have an impact on the market. So I believe 2018 will be a year of full recovery and growth - and in the years to come as well. Do you plan to increase your R&D efforts in China? At the moment, we are building a food services lab in Shanghai to support food service activities in China. We have research centers in Wageningens in the Netherlands and in Singapore. They are the focus centers for infant formula. We have no plan yet to build a research lab in China, but it might still be a possibility in the future. Do infant formula products popular in Asia have any flavor difference from those in Western markets? The recipes in China are slightly different from what we have in Europe. There is a little bit of difference in the composition, such as in content of protein and lactose, as the requirements in China GB standards are different from Europe. From the quality and food safety perspective, there is no difference. Why do you like to work for consumer companies? The good thing is that you can see your own product and experience your product, compare with competitors\\\\\\' and bring your product to life. It makes it more interesting if you work for a company like FrieslandCampina because you work for the farmers. FrieslandCampina is owned by farmers. It\\\\\\'s a cooperative, so we know our shareholders. We aim to provide better nutrition the generations to come and a good living for our farmers. What\\\\\\'s your management style like? I try to assemble people around me, most of them are much better than I am myself, and I give them a lot of responsibilities. In my previous jobs, I hated it when the general manager looked over my shoulder. You have to give them freedom to work and trust them. That\\\\\\'s what I\\\\\\'m trying to apply at my work. I think that getting high-caliber people, people who deserve trust, and then giving them freedom is important, so I can focus on the primary tasks of a CEO, which are employee management and looking at the general direction and sustainability. I\\\\\\'m a down-to-earth boss. I was born in the northern part of the Netherlands, and there is a saying says that \"you should never forget where you come from. Another saying says that \"it could always be worse\", which keeps people humble. How do you spend your weekend? When I\\\\\\'m not traveling on business trips, I try to spend time with my family. Earlier I traveled with my wife to the southern part of Argentina. It was a trip that I wanted to do for a long time. It was a very interesting and almost spiritual experience. For the rest of my time on weekends, I do sports. I play golf and I run. I have run two marathons. I also bought a racing bike. I want a healthy life because when I am on business trips, there\\\\\\'s usually not much exercise and a lot of eating and drinking, which isn\\\\\\'t good for the body. Do you lead a green lifestyle? I try to live an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. I separate my waste and we have energy and gas from green sources. My car is a hybrid and uses both fuel and electricity. These are only small things. But it shows that whenever it\\\\\\'s possible, we are trying to have a green approach to life. What\\\\\\'s your favorite Chinese city? I have been here many times since 1995, but I have not seen enough Chinese cities yet. The cities I visited are very special in themselves. Beijing has a rich history. Shanghai breathes the international dimension into China, so I like that as well. Looking out from a hotel in Pudong was a very nice experience, particularly at night. I have no special preferences, but I always like to visit new cities and to explore. zhuwenqian@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page31)\\'\\n \\'Tsingtao quenches global thirst by pursuing high quality through innovation On Dec 1, Mike Steward, a cyber engineer from Boston, in the United States, tweeted about Tsingtao: \"I\\\\\\'m in love with this beer.

The year-on-year increase reached 80 percent in South Korea, 55 percent in Russia and 97 percent in Costa Rica.   - Bottles of beer are selected for quality tests at Tsingtao\\\\\\'s production base in Luoyang, Henan province. Provided to China Daily  Founded in 1903 by beer-savvy German and British merchants in China, Tsingtao is sold in 94 countries and regions. The company has hosted one of the world\\\\\\'s largest beer festivals, the Qingdao International Beer Festival, or Asian Oktoberfest, for 26 years. In 2015, Tsingtao Brewery sold 8.48 million kiloliters of beer, with revenue reaching 27.64 billion yuan ($4.15 billion; 3.44 billion euros; 3.44 billion). It is now ranked fifth globally in the sector in terms of production output, according to the Barth Report, an authoritative beer industry compilation. In a recent interview, Sun Mingbo, chairman of Tsingtao Brewery, said: \"We want to actively explore overseas markets. There is consensus in China\\\\\\'s liquor industry that we need to build brands with an international reputation.\" The UK has pub culture and its consumers are very picky about beer quality and taste. That Tsingtao beer sales increased at least 10 percent annually in recent years is a tribute to its resilience in the market. According to James Wright, a UK-based Tsingtao dealer, there are more than 2,000 beer brands in the UK market. \"Tsingtao has actually been one of the stand-out brands. The Chinese brand\\\\\\'s market share kept growing in the UK\\\\\\'s imported beer sales,\" he says. This is all the more impressive when you consider that beer sales have stuttered in the UK in recent years due to the exorbitant duties, Wright says.    In Germany, where fresh breweries are seen all over and a total of 5,000 brands are sold, the average price of Tsingtao beer is set at 3 euros ($3.2; 2.6), compared with 0.8 euro to 1 euro of local brands. At least 150,000 boxes of Tsingtao beer have been sold in Germany annually in recent years. \"The pursuit of higher quality through innovation has been a major driver for Tsingtao\\\\\\'s overseas market expansion,\" says Sun. In order to ensure products meet high standards, Tsingtao brewers must stick to a strict and detailed brewing process, which has 113 years of history. Each bottle goes through 1,800 procedures before it is delivered to market. \"For a Chinese brand, it takes decades rather than years to gain recognition in the international markets, and the quality is the foundation to achieve that. \"Tsingtao does not intend to produce low-end products just to improve sales in the international market. Our products aim at the global middle and high-end markets.\" Tsingtao is also trying to diversify its products to meet changing market demand. For instance, Tsingtao\\\\\\'s factory in Qingdao used to produce only three kinds of beer in the 1980s, compared to the current 183 varieties. Tsingtao\\\\\\'s factories nationwide are producing 1,500 beer products across more than 20 categories. It has launched several new products, including special packages for festival events, high-end black beer (or schwarzbier, a dark lager usually made in Germany) and football packages to upgrade its portfolio. Zhang Yi, senior customer manager of Tsingtao Overseas Business Department, says: \"We offer customized packages on festive occasions in different countries and ensure that all our design elements embody traditional Chinese culture in depth, so that people in these countries can fully understand Chinese zodiac and festival culture.\" With a brand value estimated at about 116.9 billion yuan, Tsingtao Brewery leads China\\\\\\'s beer industry, according to the World Brand Lab, a leading independent consultancy of brand valuations. xiechuanjiao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page27)\\'\\n \\'SOE Tisco attains a breakthrough in the making of special steel, stirs debate on quality Shanxi-based Taiyuan Iron & Steel Co Ltd, or Tisco, one of China\\\\\\'s major stainless steel producers, has independently developed the specialty steel needed to make the feedstock for ballpoint pens tips. It is hoped this will replace the annual import of 1,000 metric tons of special steel for making the pen tips. \"The feedstock, as small as it is (only 2.3 millimeters thick), requires an exact proportion of microelements,\" says Wang Huimian, senior engineer of Taiyuan Iron and Steel.   A quality control worker examines raw material used in the manufacture of ballpen tips at Taiyuan Iron & Steel Co Ltd in Shanxi province. Sun Ruisheng / China Daily  With 26 years\\\\\\' experience of working in technological development teams, Wang says that the ballpoint pens\\\\\\' feedstock was a tough nut to crack. \"The steel requires the exactly right proportion of a number of special microelements to maximize the pen\\\\\\'s performance. Even a small difference in the proportions of the elements would affect the final quality. If the right proportions could not be found, China would always have to rely on imports,\" says Wang. The tip of a ballpen is made up of two parts: the tungsten carbide ball for writing and the feedstock for holding the ball. China produces and exports the tungsten carbide ball. But the feedstock relies on imports from countries such as Switzerland and Japan. China\\\\\\'s overall iron and steel output is in excess. Yet most of the overcapacity is in ordinary and low-quality products. The country still has to import technology-intensive specialty steel. The country makes 38 billion ballpoint pens every year, more than any other country in the world. But it has to import more than 1,000 tons of steel for pen tips at 120,000 yuan ($17,386; 16,405 euros; 14,203) per ton. Taiyuan Iron & Steel\\\\\\'s project for developing homegrown feedstock started five years ago in collaboration with Beifa Group, one of China\\\\\\'s largest makers of ballpoint pens, based in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. Li Jianmin, technological director of Taiyuan Iron & Steel, said that additives in the steel affect the ability of the final product to resist corrosion. The quality of the feedstock is controlled by strictly managing the additives at every stage, including rolling, wire-drawing and heat treatment. \"The proportion of microelements that overseas companies use is usually a top secret. Taiyuan Iron & Steel has deciphered the proportion independently through thousands of experiments,\" Li says. The developers drew inspiration from making dough. \"If you want dough to be of just the right softness, you need additives. It\\\\\\'s the same with steel. The ordinary additives are in the shape of lumps. If they can be made fine and smooth, the liquid steel and additives will be more evenly blended,\" Wang says. The technological breakthrough has pushed up the stock price of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Co Ltd, the group\\\\\\'s subsidiary listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. From Jan 9 to 11, its stock price rose by 27.4 percent to 5.12 yuan.

Although total sales volumes of beer in 2015 fell 4.9 percent year-on-year, sales of premium beer and super premium beer increased by 9 percent and 17 percent respectively, according to Fang Gang, a Beijing-based beer marketing specialist. \"Midrange and low-priced beer still commands at least 80 percent of the beer market in China, but supply exceeds demand in that segment,\" he says. In response, local breweries like Tsingtao Beer, Yanjing Beer and China Resources\\\\\\' Snow Beer launched a number of premium products in the past two years to compete against imported brands that now sit at the top of the sales pyramid.    But the premium and super premium market in China is actually still under development, according to Zhu Danpeng, a researcher at the China Brand Research Institute, specializing in food and beverage business. \"To develop the market, cultivating a beer culture is the key,\" says Hsu from AB InBev China, which sells 20-odd premium and super premium brands in China, including Corona and Stella Artois. For example, AB InBev recently brought the Corona Sunsets Music Festival to Guangzhou in southern China\\\\\\'s Guangdong province . It built a 7,000-square-meter artificial beach, where young people could dance to music while holding Corona beer served with lime. \"We will introduce more premium beer and the top brand of each type to Chinese consumers,\" Hsu says. \"By linking a brand to a particular drinking ritual and lifestyle, we hope to build up special connections between consumers and different products.\" xujingxi@chinadaily.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page29)\\'\\n \\'You have a work bunker?

Gore also won the popular vote in the 2000 US presidential election, but he was considered by many to have won the majority of electoral college votes because of electoral fraud in Florida. Yet even Gore, who has a better case to have overturned his defeat in 2000 than Clinton has in 2016, eventually conceded defeat.\\\\nThese people seeking to circumvent current electoral college convention are, in other words, trying to move the goalposts on Donald Trump and his supporters.\\\\nMoving the goalposts is a type of logical fallacy whereby when a person has met the criteria required to succeed subsequently the criteria are changed to something different or raised to a higher standard (also referred to as \"raising the bar\").\\\\nMoving the goalposts is unethical. When it occurs in the sporting world, a penalty is bestowed on the offending team.\\\\nMORE... Bios of Clinton and Trump, if They were Running for Office in Cuba - An Alternate Narrative Dump Trump, Dump Clinton, Look To the Conventions John Stauber: The system that chooses and elects the American president is a farce A voice for the American Socialist: An interview with Mimi Soltysik, Socialist Party USA Presidential candidate On 8 November candidate Donald Trump surpassed 270 electoral college votes and was declared winner of the 2016 election. Yet we hear from Democracy Now! of a movement to overturn the system of winner take-all electoral college votes in a state. The show referred to a petition supported by the celebrity Lady Gaga asking: \"Electoral College: Make Hillary Clinton President on December 19.\"\\\\nIt calls on the electors to ignore the current rules, which bind them to voting for the winner of their state, and cast their ballots instead for the winner of the popular vote, Hillary Clinton.\\\\nDemocracy Now! reports than 2 million people have signed the petition.\\\\nWhat it Signifies for US Democracy\\\\nThe United States is not a democracy in any meaningful sense. Despite the US relentlessly tooting its own horn as the bastion of democracy, it is arguably inferior in level of democratic attainment even compared to nations it considers nemeses â\\\\x80\\\\x94 Cuba and China â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and that it fallaciously derides as being dictatorships.\\\\nConferring victory upon the candidate who garners the plurality of votes in an election will do little to assuage the democratic deficit in the US.\\\\nYes, deciding the outcome of an election through the electoral college vote seems out-dated at any point in time. However, overturning the rules of the game post hoc poses another logical quandary: the slippery slope. If a precedent is set whereby the rules of the game can be changed during play or after the match, then what is to stop the rules being tampered with again in the future when a result is not to a powerful side\\\\\\'s liking?\\\\nThere are many crucial steps required before the United States can present itself as a meaningful democracy: for example, among others, discarding the electoral college, bringing transparency to party primaries, overturning Citizens United , providing impartial and equal media coverage for all candidates (including \"third\" party candidates) during an election, easing the barriers for \"third\" party electoral participation, facilitating electoral participation for all Americans. These measures must be implemented before an election. They must not be implemented during or after an election to change the result. It is unfair. That is elementary morality that any child would comprehend.\\'\\n \\'The second video (bottom one ) proves what Trump is sayng is true , corruption with the Clinton gang is rife , he could use this in his arguments . http://www.opb.org/news/series/burns-oregon-standoff-bundy-militia-news-updates/ammon-bundy-verdict-oregon-standoff-malheur-court/   And lets not forget there were 15 undercover FBI infrmants doing the provications = set up . \\'\\n \\'3 Shares\\\\n2 0 0 1\\\\n(Credit: Ken Yeung / flickr)\\\\nShortly after Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s crushing defeat, the media came up with another spin: Zuckerberg and Facebook were held responsible for her debacle! What crap! Facebook apparently carried \"fake news\". Didn\\\\\\'t the media invent and promote precisely this kind of \"news\" to bounce Hillary over the last hurdle? It\\\\\\'s convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and Hillary\\\\\\'s corrupt campaign organization for her defeat. Clinton labeled ordinary Americans \"deplorables\", displaying her contempt for half of the population. Hillary Clinton was favorite puppet of the Establishment. She was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system. And the American people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image. An estimated 95 per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husband\\\\\\'s corrupt Clinton Foundation.\\\\nThe real reason behind the attempt to blame Zuckerberg\\\\\\'s Facebook is, that it makes everyone (and no one) responsible. What is posted on Facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class. They lost control of public opinion. Established methods of mind-control do not work any longer. The fawning media report only what they are fed by government spin-doctors. It is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters. This holds true for US media, as well of the media class in the European vassal states. German media were, for example, as manipulative as those in the United States. They celebrated President Obama as the embodiment of \"good America\", ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency, incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extra-legal executions. But he possessed a great advantage, he was black, or if you wish, non-white. Obama was thus a non-white and smarter version of George W. Bush.\\\\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg visited Berlin in February 2016, he was bootlicked by the German political and media class. The Springer group, the most outspoken mouthpiece of U.S. interests US in Germany, awarded him the Axel Springer Award. Of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between Zuckerberg and Chancellor Angela Merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against so-called hate-speech on the internet. The Merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy. Merkelâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s minister of justice, Heiko Maas, has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for \"hate speech\", whatever that means.\\\\nThere is no agreed upon definition what \"hate speech\" implies, hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily. The range of \"Hate speech\" can range from anti-Muslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call \"to kill every Jewish Zionist\". There is a duty of government under the \"International Convention for the Abolition of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\", to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda. Ergo, there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of \"hate speech\".\\\\nEven restrictions to â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfree speechâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d extend to other spheres, such as prohibition of deceitful advertising, slandering other people, and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in Iceland. Human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values. There is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights.\\\\nIn Germany, this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as \"klicksafe.de, \"jugendschutz.net\", \"Gesicht zeigen\" (Show your Face), to name a few. The most eminent of these is the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, run by a former Stasi agent by the name of Anetta Kahane, who claims to fight racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia. Today, she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of Merkel\\\\\\'s policy of government failure.\\\\nInternet giants such as Facebook, Google (and YouTube) and Twitter also participated \"voluntarily\" in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up. In September 2015, this new \"censorship body\" was established in the German Ministry of Justice and works since then without legal basis! The participants agreed on \"best practices\" in handling hate messages. There are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize \"hate speach\". That means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily. There are no rules or statutory provisions. Those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship. Despite such arbitrary practice, the interim results, which were presented in the Ministry of Justice on 27 September 2016 were not satisfactory. Google (and YouTube) and Facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results. From August to September, 622 punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Justice was not satisfied.\\\\nThus, it is not only the American political class which is blaming Facebook for the defeat of its minion Hillary Clinton but also the German political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on Facebook, fearing that ordinary people could endanger Merkel\\\\\\'s quest for a renewed mandate as Chancellor. But what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the \"deplorables\", i.e. the mass of ordinary people, do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editors-in-chief. The attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of Facebook and Google.\\\\nAt the beginning, Zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for Clinton\\\\\\'s defeat. After a while, it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in. On Friday, November 18, 2016, Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook that the amount of \"misinformation is relatively small\", nonetheless there is \"much work ahead on our roadmap\". The following work in progress was outlined by him:\\\\n\"A stronger detection system. The most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.\\\\n- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster.\\\\n- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more.\\\\n- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them.\\\\n- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed.\\\\n- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We\\\\\\'re looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.\\\\n- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.\"\\\\nApparently, Zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue. I beg to differ. The issue is not about fake news, it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mind-control industry, owned by a few families on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. If they lose this control of public opinion, they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges.\\\\nDear Mr. Zuckerberg, take courage, and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class.\\\\nWhen one discusses freedom of expression and the role of Facebook one point needs special scrutiny, namely the private character of this entity. The private character of an entity precludes transparency. Citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances, let alone participate in determining Facebook projects and policies. As a citizen, one cannot accept that one unelected person, however, nice he may be, could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings. Such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule. One can see this operating within Wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of 9/11 or the Israel/Palestinian conflict. It\\\\\\'s impossible to even insert critical question because they don\\\\\\'t pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control. Google is another such Leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership. How such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer. The first step would certainly be for civil society, without influence from the corporate world, to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services. It would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal.\\'\\n \\'adobochron 7 Comments A rendering of the Trump Tower in Makati City, Philippines \\\\nMAKATI CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) â\\\\x80\\\\x93 When completed by the end of 2016, the Trump Tower in the Philippines will be among the countryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s tallest buildings . But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. \\\\nLaunched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization.

Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Duterte said. \\\\nAsked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nTouchÃ©!\\'\\n \"It seems the only way left for Hillary Clinton camp to cover her lies and misdeeds of Clinton\\'s clan, is to use the misleading and false Russian\\'s card!\"\\n \\'By Jack Burns WikiLeaks is helping President Obama keep his 2008 campaign promise â\\\\x80\\\\x94 to be the most transparent administration in U.S. history â\\\\x80\\\\x94 whether he likes... \\'\\n \\'a reply to: IAMTAT I like knowing that the powers of good are working quite effectively in the background.

THE ULTIMATE LOSERS IN THE 2016 ELECTION - THE MSM For the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream media\\\\\\'s unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against Donald Trump, where 91 percent of the reporting since the party\\\\\\'s convention, where he was named the GOP nominee, has been studied and found to have been negative, but even before that they treated Trump as if he didn\\\\\\'t stand a chance to win that nomination.We have noted and reported via Wikileaks releases how that very same MSM had colluded with the DNC and the Clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect Hillary Clinton.We have also observed and reported how Trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, uneducated, uninformed, white nationalist deplorables, just to name a few of the colorful descriptors.How did that work out for them?Despite their biased reporting and throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at Trump, we now have President-Elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, to be sworn in on January 20, 2017. While Hillary Clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything Trump does for the next four (maybe 8?) years, and progressives will get over their sworn \"revolution\" within the party between liberals and moderate Democrats, the ultimate losers are not Clinton supporters, celebrities that swore to leave the country if Trump won, nor Democrats as a party.... it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant, crushed by a wave of \"deplorables\" and alternative media bypassing their once-influential status to communicate without their fasle prism of \\\\\\'truth.\\\\\\' MSM\\\\\\'S LAST GASP Now they are offering their mea culpas, dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise, and taking their \"last gasp\" by swearing to \"rededicate\" themselves to reporting honestly, while at the same time claiming they reported on \"both candidates fairly.\"I kid you not.Below is a letter by Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet, the publisher and editor of the New York Times:First point is that if they had been reporting \"fairly\" as claimed in the letter above, they would not need to \"rededicate\" themselves to honesty. Secondly, they did not strive \"to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences,\" of Trump supporters, rather they maligned, criticized, belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinion.While it is to be expected that Trump supporters, verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the Times, the Public Editor Liz Spayd, who works independently, with the job of examining The Times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices, describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting. Readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate. HereÂ\\\\x92s one that summed up the feelings succinctly, from Kathleen Casey of Houston: \"Now, that the world has been upended and you are all, to a person, in a state of surprise and shock, you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think, and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader (and nonreaders) actually think.\" Another letter, from Nick Crawford of Plymouth, Mich., made a similar point. \"Perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary Americans care about, rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors,\" he wrote. \"Please come down from your New York City skyscraper and join the rest of us.\" What Ms. Spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor, the ones that wrote the letter in the image above, continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair, or to even pretend they attempted to \"understand and reflect all political perspectives.\" What Ms. Spayd also does not address is the fact that five different New York Times\\\\\\' reporters accepted the invitations for the off-the-record gatherings to \"frame the HRC message\" with the Clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched, including, Gail Collins, Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman, Patrick Healy, and Amy Chozick, all of which consistently penned hit pieces against Trump.It is heartening to see that outlets like the New York Times are being called to the carpet by their own readers, as well as admitting they are losing subscribers, because while Trump supporters were maligned and lied about, their readers were misinformed and lied to . The countryÂ\\\\x92s major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. TrumpÂ\\\\x92s ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong? The question came in letters. (\"To editors and writers of The NYT,\" one reader wrote, \"you were so wrong for so long. You misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry.\") It came in Facebook posts. (\"You were in a bubble and werenÂ\\\\x92t paying attention to your fellow Americans,\" the filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a post shared more than 100,000 times.) Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions, something that will surely be monitored. Former Times\\\\\\' reporter Michael Goodwin offers the Times some free advice : Using an outside law firm or even in-house reporters, he must assess how and why Baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots. He must assess the impact on reporters and editors, and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to BaquetÂ\\\\x92s political bias. Whatever the findings, the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room. As an added guarantee, he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the Times embedded liberal slant. There has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies. Readers, and former readers, should be part of the process. Many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial New York and into the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere. This is about survival. If it doesnÂ\\\\x92t change now, the Gray LadyÂ\\\\x92s days surely are numbered. BOTTOM LINE Frankly I believe traditional media\\\\\\'s days are numbered whatever they do, and they are on their last gasp. There are too many Independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant. While alternative media has its own set of biases, the majority always provide links, documents when available, video clips and other methods for readers to verify, research and come to their own conclusions, something mainstream media doesn\\\\\\'t want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the MSM wants them to go, rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations.\\'\\n \\'on February 15, 2015 11:17 am Â· \\\\nItâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a common stereotype that food stamp recipients, and those who abuse it, are black, Hispanic, or any other race but white.

Brushton, New York, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. Approximately 99.83% of the population is white, and 0.42% are black. These demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , Owsley Country, Kentucky, which is 99.22% white and 95% Republican. Maybe we should investigate them. \\\\nI just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in Brushton. \\\\nAccording to WPTZ News: \\\\nPolice say the arrests are the result of a year-long investigation, initiated by the Franklin County Department of Social Services Fraud Unit.

Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.\\\\nMORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur\\'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven â\\\\x80\\\\x98researchâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.\\\\n Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize AverrÃ¶es, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.\\\\nChapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khaldunâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khaldunâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Qurâ\\\\x80\\\\x99an as the origin and prophet Muhammadâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 and Lockeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.\\\\nIn Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the authorâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Qurâ\\\\x80\\\\x99an they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Qurâ\\\\x80\\\\x99an. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.\\\\nSimilar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.\\\\nIn Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in todayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.\\\\nOften when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist â\\\\x80\\\\x98scholarsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyoneâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.\\\\nChapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of todayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.\\\\nChapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.\\\\nChapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.\\\\nChapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.\\\\nAnyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever. This depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression.\\\\nThis book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, Islam that means peace through submission to the creator. This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s world. In this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace.\"\\n \\'The green fraud has a lot to do with it all as exposed in the emails . http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/miranda-devine-foreignfunded-green-groups-could-take-whole-swathes-of-australia-out-of-the-productive-economy/news-story/016e5d9ff252f2444790d05269f4ed90\\'\\n \\'By Nick Bernabe \\\\nFollowing the recent mass arrests of 141 people at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site located near Standing Rock, North Dakota, an anonymous donor just donated $2.5 million to bail out everyone who was arrested at the protests. \\\\nThe news came after Tamara Francis-Fourkiller, a tribal leader from the Caddo Nation tribe in Caddo County, Oklahoma, was arrested at Standing Rock.

The hearing, which will be conducted over the phone at 3 p.m. Pacific time, will allow each side to give 30-minute arguments. The plaintiffs in this appeal, Washington and Minnesota, will state their case, as will the Department of Justice. The public can listen to the hearings live on the 9th Circuit website. The judges are expected to rule on the future of the executive order after hearing oral arguments. While their decision won\\\\\\'t determine the constitutionality of Trump\\\\\\'s immigration ban, it will determine whether the suspension of the executive order, ruled by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, will remain. The two states have argued that Trump\\\\\\'s order was likely to cause \"irreparable harm\" to businesses, schools, family relations and state residents\\\\\\' freedom to travel and is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of religion. The Justice Department said the travel restrictions are a matter of national security and the administration was excluding people from countries with ties to terrorism, not people of a certain religion.     Today, Trump suggested that the legal battle between the two states and the Justice Department could make it all the way to the Supreme Court. \"We\\\\\\'re going to take it through the system,\" said Trump. \"It\\\\\\'s very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date.\" On Capitol Hill today, Secretary of >Homeland Security John Kelly defended the immigration executive order, calling it \"lawful and constitutional.\" Only a week old, the order has sparked protests and outcry across the country. The legal community has been grappling with the order, some travelers have been delayed, and others are wondering if they will be allowed previously approved entry into the United States. The order, called Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, bars all people with immigrant and nonimmigrant visas from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for 90 days. It also prevents the entry of refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, with an indefinite ban on refugees from the war-torn country of Syria. The Monday after Trump signed his order, Washington state filed a legal challenge that was joined by Minnesota. Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, on Friday issued a temporary restraining order, which covers the entire U.S., blocking the travel ban. Trump immediately took issue with the move, tweeting on Saturday, \"The opinion of this so-called judge ... is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" On Saturday the Department of Justice, challenging Robart\\\\\\'s ruling, turned to the powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to try to immediately lift the restraining order while the appeal was being considered. The appeals court denied the request. The outcome of today\\\\\\'s hearing with the 9th Circuit could determine \"?at least temporarily \"?the fate of thousands of refugees, immigrants and travelers in the United States and abroad hoping to enter the U.S.\\'\\n \\'Thirty-eight years after she first appeared on the cover of the coveted magazine, Brinkley is back in the pages -- this time with daughters Alexa Ray Joel, 31 and Sailor Brinkley Cook, 18.

Nick J.B. Moore / For China Daily  The title eventually chosen was Power and Pragmatism, concepts that perhaps best sum up the career of the respected Scottish politician who served as a cabinet minister under former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major for 18 continuous years, a feat (shared with three of his ministerial colleagues) not achieved since the 1820s. Rifkind, who was speaking in the lounge of the Intercontinental London Park Lane Hotel in Mayfair, says that pragmatic politicians differ from conviction politicians in that they don\\\\\\'t feel guilty adapting their positions to circumstances. \"The pragmatist is much more relaxed about it. It doesn\\\\\\'t mean the pragmatist has no convictions but if you are dealing with a problem and your previous conceptual or philosophical preference does not add up, it is OK to ask, what else would work?\"    In the book- full of dry observations and witty anecdotes-he recounts the negotiations leading up to the handover of Hong Kong back to China on June 30, 1997. He was foreign secretary up until a month before, when the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the hand of incoming Labour prime minister Tony Blair and he himself lost his Edinburgh Pentlands seat in Parliament, which he had held for 23 years. He held his first meeting with Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen in London in 1995 and when he visited Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland the following January he was given the nickname in the local press of \"Li Wenjun\", meaning \"a cultured gentleman\". \"Much of the hard work had already been done by Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe (the former foreign secretary who had negotiated the 1984 Joint Declaration that paved the way for the handover). So I was just dealing with a number of unresolved issues, or new issues that had arisen. It was not too difficult,\" he says. \"Because we were approaching the moment of truth, obviously within Hong Kong itself there was increased nervousness about what the changeover would mean.\" Rifkind makes the point that Beijing resuming control of Hong Kong was an unprecedented event. \"It was a unique problem which required a unique solutions so it is fair to say that Hong Kong remains governed by a different system to the rest of China,\" he says. \"The fundamental commitment to two systems in one country has been honored, in the sense you know.\" The book charts his career from an up-and-coming Scottish advocate to being elected as a Member of Parliament when he was only in his late 20s. Although gifted with an uncanny ability-honed in debates at university-to speak without notes, he is slightly bemused by his reputation as an intellectual, which he modestly says belies his actual academic achievements at school. His first cabinet appointment came under Mrs Thatcher when he was made secretary of state for Scotland in 1986. He believes Scottish public opinion remains firmly against independence and that, as a result, Scotland\\\\\\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will not trigger a second referendum, despite her rhetoric.    \"Mrs Sturgeon is a very clever lady and she knows if she had one, she would almost certainly lose it.\" Rifkind says he is not surprised that China has emerged as such a powerful economy over the past 40 years. \"It was always inevitable that would happen. You could not have a country the size of China with such a huge population, as well as its historical and cultural identity going back 2,000 years, where that was not the case,\" he says. \"China should always have been a great power. It should always have been the largest or second largest economy in the world.\" He believes former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping\\\\\\'s reform and opening up agenda in the late 1970s proved the catalyst. \"Chinese societies that have had experience of capitalism have been brilliantly successful. The economic reforms in China, starting with Deng Xiaoping, turned China into a capitalist system, albeit with communist characteristics.\" One of the UK\\\\\\'s foreign policy shifts in recent years was the heralding of a new \"golden era\" of relations with China, culminating in Chinese President Xi Jinping\\\\\\'s state visit to London and Manchester in 2015. Some have suggested that new Prime Minister Theresa May is less willing than her predecessor David Cameron to fully embrace the world\\\\\\'s second largest economy. The new government, however, did finally give the go-ahead to Chinese investment in Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in the west of England, despite calling in the decision for review. \"If Mrs May\\\\\\'s government had ended up rejecting Hinkley Point, that would have represented a sea change. That would have been fundamental - but she didn\\\\\\'t,\" he says. \"There were a number of safeguards that were insisted upon but Chinese investment in the UK economy, and in particular its nuclear industry, is continuing. So to that degree there is continuity.\" One of the major questions is whether the UK\\\\\\'s referendum decision in June to leave the European Union will make it a less attractive place to invest. Rifkind, who supported the UK remaining in the EU, says the country\\\\\\'s uncertain status makes it more difficult for the Chinese and others to make investment decisions. \"Clearly any major companies from other parts of the world, who have a European market with a headquarters in the UK, ask themselves \"what does this mean for us?\" He, however, believes the UK will prove itself to be resilient in the end. \"If you only have 65 million people and you are the 5th or 6th largest economy in the world, that is an enormous economic achievement. That strength didn\\\\\\'t begin when we joined the EU and it doesn\\\\\\'t disappear because we have left it.\" Rifkind had to resign his seat before the 2015 General Election, having been caught up in a sting by the Channel 4 Dispatches program, where he was secretly filmed discussing a potential board position for a fictitious East European company. Suggestions there was a conflict of interest were later dismissed as groundless by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. The veteran politician, who at the time of this interview was about to address a conference on the Middle East, said he felt it was the right time to set the record straight on many aspects of his life by writing his autobiography. \"I\\\\\\'d always sort of assumed that in the dim and distant future I would write a book of this kind and it was about a year ago that I gradually had to come to terms with the fact that, as I was approaching 70, the dim and distant future had arrived.\" andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page32)\\'\\n \\'Her work has inspired Oscar-winning director Ang Lee and she is considered one of the most important Chinese writers of the 20th century, but Eileen Chang has yet to make a major impact in the West. Translator Karen S. Kingsbury says she is determined to change that and persuade readers in the United States to understand why Chang is worthy of their attention through a biography she is working on. \"I am not planning just to write an English version of the already existing biographies in Chinese. I will try to speak to an American audience to explain why Eileen Chang is so worth their attention,\" says Kingsbury. When Kingsbury first read Chang\\\\\\'s Love in a Fallen City in Chinese, her Chinese wasn\\\\\\'t very good. \"But it\\\\\\'s like a magnet that pulls you into it, and you become a translator because of that text,\" recalls Kingsbury. The American academic wrote her doctoral dissertation on Chang, completing it in 1995, the same year Chang died in Los Angeles of cardiovascular disease.    Since then, Kingsbury has published translations of Chang\\\\\\'s Love in a Fallen City and Half a Lifelong Romance. Kingsbury\\\\\\'s translation of Love in a Fallen City was first published in Renditions, a literary journal run by Chinese University of Hong Kong, for a special issue in memory of Chang in 1996. Together with translations of Chang\\\\\\'s other short stories, it was later published by Penguin in 2007, and it has been selling steadily since then. The same year, Ang Lee released his erotic thriller Lust, Caution, based on a short story by Chang. The movie won many awards, including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and was nominated for a Golden Globe in the United States. The growing interest in Chang prompted Kingsbury to translate Half a Lifelong Romance, which took her six years to finish and was published by Penguin in 2014. Born to an elite family in Shanghai in 1920, Chang read a lot of classical Chinese literature and started publishing stories when she was still in middle school. She studied English literature at the University of Hong Kong and emigrated to the US in 1955. Chang\\\\\\'s life in the US was a personal and professional struggle. Her second husband, Ferdinand Reyher, an American screenwriter, suffered a series of strokes and died in 1967, and she didn\\\\\\'t gain much popularity until after her death. Kingsbury is a professor of international studies at the faculty of English at Chatham University in Pennsylvania, and Chang features strongly in the curriculum. \"It was very helpful to remind them (the students) that when you\\\\\\'re living in Shanghai in the 1930s - even though the Japanese are bombing the city and all kinds of terrible things are happening - there is still a kind of daily life that is going on,\" Kingsbury says at a seminar on translation in Beijing. By relegating major historical events, such as the Japanese invasion of China and the outbreak of World War II, Chang emphasized the private lives of her characters - human emotions, marriage and family matters. \"Chang\\\\\\'s works won\\\\\\'t appeal to everyone, but readers who like to peer deeply into psychology will like her writing,\" says Kingsbury. Kingsbury graduated from Whitman College in Washington in 1982 and spent the next year teaching English at Sichuan Foreign Studies University in China, where she began a lifelong passion for Chinese literature. She became interested in Chang when she was studying comparative literature at Columbia University in New York under the guidance of Hsia Chih-tsing and Wang Der-wei, two renowned scholars who praised Chang\\\\\\'s works.    - Kingsbury\\\\\\'s translations of Eileen Chang\\\\\\'s Half a Lifelong Romance and Love in a Fallen City.

But now she is a wildlife photographer, taking photos of endangered species. In the past three years, Gu has trekked to the Earth\\\\\\'s \"three poles\" - the North Pole, South Pole and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau - to catch a glimpse of wildlife living in the most extreme environments of the planet. Her shots of polar bears, emperor penguins and Tibetan antelopes, and her efforts to promote public awareness of endangered animals, won her the title of 2016 Chinese Culture Person of the Year, awarded on Jan 11 by the Chinese Culture Promotion Society.   - Tibetan antelopes cross the Qinghai-Tibet Highway in a picture Gu Ying took in 2016 in Qinghai\\\\\\'s Hol Xil. Provided to China Daily  Gu was born into a military family in Beijing. Her parents worked in the air force and, when she was still a little girl her family was relocated to a radar base in the mountains near Xuzhou, Jiangsu province. \"Sometimes I missed the school bus and had to walk alone on the mountainous paths between home and school,\" recalls Gu. \"I got my guts and love for nature during that period of time.\" After graduating from university, Gu worked in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and started a successful business in the late 1990s, but she never forgot about the mountains and went outdoors whenever she could. Once, when Gu was hiking on a mountain, a paraglider flew by and waved at her. \"I was thrilled because I once wanted to be a fighter pilot,\" says Gu. \"The paraglider evoked my childhood dream.\" Gu then registered for a paragliding course and, after three weeks\\\\\\' training, made her first flight. \"It felt like I was a bird and belonged to the sky.\"    Since then, Gu has taken many classes and later became a paragliding athlete. She won gold medals four times in national competitions and set a national women\\\\\\'s record for 100-kilometer paragliding. In 2009, Gu fell from the sky in an accident and broke her back. Luckily, her spine was not irreparably injured. After three months in bed, Gu was able to stand up again, but she had to say goodbye to her paragliding career. \"We paragliders call ourselves birdmen,\" says Gu. \"When I couldn\\\\\\'t fly like a bird, I found another hobby - taking photographs of birds.\" Since 2011, Gu has taken photos of around 1,000 species of birds in dozens of countries. Some of her photos of rare birds have been included in The Handbook of the Birds of the World. Starting with bird photography, Gu gradually became a wildlife photographer. In 2014, she embarked on a journey to capture the moment polar bears bring their newborn cubs out of their caves after hibernation. It took her more than 10 days at a base within the Arctic Circle in Canada to get a good shot. The next year, Gu flew to inland Antarctica to take shots of the emperor penguin. This time, she was stuck in a camp near the habitat of the penguins for 18 days because of strong storms caused by the El Nino effect. \"Everyone was frustrated, but I was very happy because I could spend more time taking photos of emperor penguins,\" says Gu. \"And only in storms could one capture their real living environment.\" \"Every day, I spent more than 10 hours out there photographing the penguins,\" adds Gu. Last year, she went to Hoh Xil in Qinghai province three times. She wanted to photograph Tibetan antelopes in the least populated area of China, 5,000 meters above sea level. In order to capture the Tibetan antelope\\\\\\'s breeding process, Gu remained hidden from 5am to 9pm every day. \"I could not go outside, nor eat any food that had a smell. It was really tough, but I think it was worth it,\" says Gu, whose photos have been used by the Hoh Xil local government in applying for UNESCO\\\\\\'s World Heritage List. \"After all these years photographing wildlife, recording their lives has begun to feel like a responsibility for me,\" says Gu. \"But I don\\\\\\'t want my photos to be the last \\\\\\'living monuments\\\\\\' of those species that can be seen only in a frame.\" xingyi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page19)\\'\\n \\'Imagining public parks with no walls Imagine a park that has no barrier from the surrounding neighborhood, nothing to prevent you stepping right off the sidewalk into the park from any direction. This is hardly a revolutionary concept in urban design. In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking it is, in fact, the dictionary definition of a public park.       The announcement of a plan by a land developer in Shanghai\\\\\\'s Xuhui district to make an open-access, fenceless green space on land donated by the local government in the new central business district was enthusiastically received by local media, which promoted it as a centerpiece of modernized city planning and Xuhui\\\\\\'s own version of Central Park. Back in 2009, the Guangzhou government\\\\\\'s \"give the park back to the people\" movement had the same bright idea, proposing the removal of the walls around three of its biggest urban parks. In this case, however, the plans were temporarily halted due to an outcry from local residents. One elderly Guangzhou resident said: \"Tear down the walls, and you can no longer call it a park.\" His argument was a linguistic one - the character å\\\\x9b?(yu¨¢n), for garden, is the Chinese word for \"public park\" (å\\\\x85¬å\\\\x9b\\\\xad, gÅ\\\\x8dng yu¨¢n, public garden) uses the radical, which comes from the ancient ideographic representation for enclosure. Other citizens translated his concern into more practical terms: without walls, what was to prevent the park from becoming a \"free hotel\" for the homeless, or a wretched hive of criminals who could enter and escape at will? Encouraged by official directives to add recreational areas and green spaces to the urban landscape, cities in China are increasingly building so-called \"open-style parks\" (å¼\\\\x80æ\\\\x94¾å¼\\\\x8få\\\\x85¬å\\\\x9b\\\\xad, kÄ\\\\x81ifÃ\\\\xa0ng shÃ¬ gÅ\\\\x8dngyu¨¢n ). But the history of truly open-plan, public-access parks in China is short, and the learning curve they present is steep. Until the early 2000s, most \"public\" parks in China - defined simply as parks not reserved for use by any danwei (å\\\\x8d\\\\x95ä½\\\\x8d, dÄ\\\\x81n w¨¦i), or work unit - not only had walls and fences but charged admission to enter. In 2002, Shanghai and the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong province, began to offer free admission to a limited number of their parks. Beijing followed in 2006. However, the terminology of \"open-style parks\" is misleading; in most cases, even without a ticket office, the parks have retained guarded entrances, opening and closing hours, and enclosures all around the perimeter. Beijing\\\\\\'s Ming Dynasty City Wall Relics Park is a special case. By the standards common to Chinese landscaping, they\\\\\\'ve gone and put walls on the wrong side. Completed in 2006, the park consists of grassy knolls, winding paths, and flowering shrubs buttressed against one of the last remaining sections of Beijing\\\\\\'s ancient fortifications; on the other side, the grass runs straight up against the sidewalk. \"Strictly speaking, that makes us an open-style green space, not an open-style park,\" says the manager of the park office, surnamed Shi. Last October, when Shanghai\\\\\\'s Xiangyang Park was reopened after renovations, which included the removal of the park\\\\\\'s outer walls, the response from the community was lukewarm. \"They don\\\\\\'t understand that the wall itself is a part of landscaping, it\\\\\\'s architecture,\" a long-time park visitor was reported as telling local news blog Shanghai Guangcha. Chinese landscaping scholar Yang Han has published papers that have been generally approving of the opening up of China\\\\\\'s urban parks, referring to the trend as the natural accompaniment for modern, urban society\\\\\\'s recreational needs. However, he has also argued that walls should not be \"blindly removed\" because their long cultural and symbolic history, as well as architectural details, make them an invaluable \"Chinese characteristic\" in landscape architecture. Walls have played an indispensable role in the two ancient styles that influenced traditional Chinese landscaping, the \"imperial garden (å¾¡è\\\\x8a±å\\\\x9b? yÃ¹ huÄ\\\\x81 yu¨¢n)\" and \"literati garden (æ\\\\x96\\\\x87äººå\\\\x9b\\\\xadæ\\\\x9e\\\\x97, w¨¦nr¨¦n yu¨¢nl¨ªn)\". Imperial gardens originated from early imperial hunting grounds, which were walled off to all users except for the emperor. These later evolved into private retreats in which the emperor could relax and enjoy his diverse, often exotic collection of plants. As with City Wall Park\\\\\\'s corner tower, there is a sense the garden being a place to preserve and showcase objects of historical interest. The \"literati garden\", of which the private gardens of China\\\\\\'s Jiangnan region are the most famous example, favored a simpler aesthetic consisting of native plants and more naturalistic arrangements. Built with a philosophy of \"high walls and deep courtyards (é«\\\\x98å¢\\\\x99å¤§é\\\\x99¢, gÄ\\\\x81oqi¨¢ng dÃ\\\\xa0yuÃ\\\\xa0n)\", they were meant to be secluded spaces for the scholar\\\\\\'s literary and spiritual contemplation, influenced by the so-called \"hermit culture in the tumultuous Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-589) period. Under this culture, educated men were encouraged to retreat from political life and cultivate their moral qualities in nature. Stepping into a Chinese park still feels like discovering a private sanctuary: Residents walk slower and without fear of being run over by bikes, while the sounds of the city are muted behind the old melodies playing on the radio as seniors dance. But Zhang Jie, a landscape engineer attached to the Parks and Greening Management Bureau of Changsha, Hunan province, is not sure that such a place ought to qualify as a public park. To him, they fail to incorporate the first character of å\\\\x85¬å\\\\x9b\\\\xad, which is å\\\\x85?(public). Screened behind walls and fences, recreation takes place out of the sight of passersby, instead of being integrated into each resident\\\\\\'s sensory experience of the city. This is a mode of life that Zhang calls \"participatory\". It was with the intention of increasing the participatory character of their communities that the Changsha government, earlier last year, gave the order to remove the walls around their public parks. \"Our country has always advocated \"\\\\x98getting close to people\\\\\\'s hearts\\\\\\', and there\\\\\\'s no better way than to welcome them to our spaces,\" Zhang says. These days, while many universities and military units are still set up like this, most urban residents of China find themselves living in their own apartments and crossing paths with strangers at every turn. In essence, this forces Chinese urban residents to adjust to a concept of \"public space\" where they must coexist with and respect the individual needs of others, rather than the socialist \"communal space\" in which they shared with others a similar, state-mandated style of living. To Zhang, this is a positive development in helping residents \"get to know their neighbors, their city, their government\". However, it\\\\\\'s also the source of much of the controversy in response to open parks in cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai, as residents\\\\\\' unease toward public spaces spills into the last remaining institutions that symbolized the old style of governance and security. Zhang says he has not received any feedback from residents anxious about their safety or the suzhi (ç´\\\\xa0è´¨), or \"quality\" of their fellow park visitors after the removal of the walls, though he admits that open parks are potentially more challenging to make safe and orderly for users. The views from the ground are mixed. On a weekday morning, a knot of local residents exercising at the City Wall Park share their impressions of the park\\\\\\'s good points and bad. They unanimously say that ease of access is the main reason that they come to the park, some of them every day. Shi believes that her park has been more or less free from controversy due to the security investments taken by Beijing as a whole. \"Each city has its own concept of safety, a different threshold for accepting these open public spaces,\" she says. Residents of Guangzhou, would probably have different concerns about its safety compared to the capital. Fang agrees that the impression of public safety is not purely due to the presence of guards but the quality of Beijing residents. \"This is a nice neighborhood,\" she stresses.

Internet celebrities are ordinary people striving to become online sensations by showing off their talents. Such celebrities in China have millions of fans, generating huge profits. Some of the most popular reportedly earn more than 300,000 yuan ($43,300; 40,638 euros; 40,638) monthly. This may explain why Nerve, which examines the dark side of the internet-celebrity craze, has struck a chord with many young Chinese, who now form a major part of the theater-going population. Since it opened on the Chinese mainland on Jan 6 - the same day as the tentpole Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Nerve has become the second highest-grossing movie among the Hollywood imports currently on the country\\'s big screen. Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the duo known for the internet fraud-themed documentary and series Catfish, the 96-minute film returns to a familiar zone: online violence triggered by the web\\'s anonymous environment. The film is based on a livestreamed game that gives weird or risky dares to players and cash rewards to the most-watched winners. It begins with tasks such as kissing a stranger or running away from a public place naked. In the movie, the protagonist, a high-school girl played by American actress Emma Roberts, is dragged into a lethal trap where viewers want to see a win-or-die competition between her and her competitor, played by Dave Franco. Despite the film\\'s popularity, most Chinese viewers reported feeling a bit disappointed with the latter part of the film. While they expected it to take an in-depth look at internet culture and its negative effects, the film\\'s conclusion failed to meet that expectation. xufan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page20)\"\\n \\'Teachers visit universities to help youngsters deal with the strain of academic life Dozens of students at Tsinghua University are practicing yoga in a stadium, following demonstrations by a teacher onstage. It\\\\\\'s part of Yogi Yoga\\\\\\'s recent public service campaign to tackle the problems of depression and anxiety among Chinese university students. The yoga center is doing a tour of 10 top universities in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai to teach students to fight stress with yoga.   - Yin Yan cofounded Yogi Yoga with Indian yoga master Man Mohan Bhandari in 2003 to promote yoga in China. Photos provided to China Daily  Yogi Yoga aims to help 100 universities within 100 days and is encouraging institutions to organize yoga classes, saying it will send volunteers to teach. \"I want to share authentic Indian yoga with others. Yoga practice can help Chinese students enjoy campus life, rather than suffer stress and anxiety,\" says Yogi Yoga co-founder Yin Yan. The former editor-in-chief of fashion magazine Elle China, she co-founded Yogi Yoga with Indian yoga master Man Mohan Bhandari, better known in China as Yogi Mohan, in 2003. They later became a couple and now have two children. \"It is estimated that more than 90 million people in China suffer from depression. The campaign aims to help those who have the potential to fall victim to depression,\" she says. Bhandari has developed some yoga postures that he says are helpful in stress management for university students. He speaks at universities and shares videos online so that more students can benefit from yoga. He also has a Sina Weibo account to answer questions from those who practice yoga. Until the end of December, a yoga teacher will be doing a daily live broadcast beginning at 7 am on an account named Yoga Digest on Sina Weibo, to encourage the Chinese to learn the ancient Indian practice. Each video attracts tens of thousands of hits. Yogi Yoga has also worked with Peking University to establish a yoga training center to offer one semester of free courses for university students, including meditation and breathing. \"Scientific research shows that yoga has positive effects in combating depression and anxiety. Yoga can help deal with one\\\\\\'s nervous system. And once your system becomes quiet, your mind will be quiet,\" says Bhandari. According to Bhandari, those who suffer from depression have one problem - they cannot breathe properly. Yoga, he says, can help them balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body. In India, most people know about yoga. They know that it is not only a physical exercise, but also deals with the mind, energy and spirituality. But for Chinese students, he has to first teach the basics. He believes there are not many differences between teaching in India and in China. Yin practices yoga postures and breathing every morning, to stretch her body. She suggests others find time to fully concentrate on yoga. \"Yoga is a good way to ease pressure and make you sleep better. Many have the misconception that it is only for those whose body is supple. Actually, those who have a stiff body should practice yoga to keep their body balanced,\" she says. \"Yoga is not a career, but it is my destiny (to promote it). It gives me faith and power,\" says Yin. For Yin, her link to yoga and her husband came from a 21-day journey to India in 2003. She spent the first week in Rishikesh to learn traditional yoga. The city is known as \"the yoga capital of the world\", with numerous yoga centers that attract visitors from all over the world. She was a bit depressed when she first saw the city\\\\\\'s streets after heavy rain: narrow muddy roads, stray dogs and vendors loudly hawking their goods. When she first encountered Bhandari, she was impressed that the young man in white robes was quiet and professional. After one week of learning yoga postures from him, her perspective began to change. There were adorable dogs in the streets filled with sunshine and friendly locals with smiles on their faces. \"In that week, nothing changed but me. As my body became relaxed and soft, so did my heart,\" she says. \"Happiness can be simple. Yoga taught me that happiness is about whether or not you are in a balanced and optimistic state. When you are in society, that state may be affected subconsciously. But yoga can help you to remain positive.\" It also stirred her creativity and she wrote a Chinese book, Song of India, the same year about the trip that changed her life. In August 2003, Yin and Bhandari co-founded Yogi Yoga in Beijing, a few months after she invited him to the city to teach her and her friends yoga. While Yin is in charge of management and operations, Bhandari is responsible for teaching. \"Yin has great vision, and she wants to give the benefits of yoga to society and initiated the events at universities,\" says Bhandari. According to Yin, yoga helps people to have an optimistic attitude toward life. Yoga is an in-depth study, not just a series of poses. She says it is better to practice yoga under the guidance of professionals to find what suits you best. For example, for those who have lumbar disc protrusion, some postures are good while others are not. xulin@chinadaily.com.cn   - Man Mohan Bhandari believes yoga can help those who suffer from depression to balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide level in the body.

Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. It\\\\\\'s only fair that we should pay homage to one of the most ancient of Chinese deities in a food column devoted to a culture largely incubated in the territory he reigns over - the kitchen. Zaojun, the Kitchen God, is a fair-faced celestial being who spends only a few days in the heavenly court of the Jade Emperor. For most of the year, he presides over the heart and hearth of earthly households, guarding the livestock, the servants and, most of all, the cooking stove. He is privy to the darkest secrets, and he sees all.   - From as long as we can remember, the portrait of the Kitchen God, seen here with his wife, has reigned over the cooking stove in many Chinese kitchens. Jin Yuequan / For China Daily  He listens to the back room gossip, the quarrels among the womenfolk. He witnesses the trickery of malingering servants, the secret stashes of food hidden for a stolen feast, the cutting of corners in the making of a complicated dish, the whispered rumors, the scandalous truths. For those reasons, when it is time for him to ascend to make his annual reports, the whole household is suddenly alerted to his imminent departure and he is showered with food offerings to put him in the best of moods. Yes, even the gods must be bribed. In this case, the Kitchen God is sent off with an appropriate feast, all of which will include a final offering that is very sticky, and very sweet. These sticky sweets, the foolish humans hope, will seal his lips or sweeten his tongue and he will return in the new year with the appropriate bountiful blessings from heaven after making a positive assessment of their merits. Right now, in kitchens large and small all across China, the preparations are starting. Zaojun will be traveling to report to his boss soon, on the 23rd day of the last lunar month, which is Jan 20. He has been doing this every year for a long, long time - as far back as the Xia Dynasty (c.21st century-16th century BC), more than 2,000 years before Christ was born. The Xia was the first recorded dynasty in Chinese history, so it is likely Zaojun has been around even longer than that. Basically, the Kitchen God has been guardian of the stove ever since the Chinese started cooking indoors. The day of his departure also signals the start to a flurry of preparations for the official arrival of Spring, a week away. His portrait, probably smoky from standing over the stove for an entire year, will be taken down, smeared with honey and reverently burnt to send him on his way. In the new year, a brand new portrait will go up on the wall. Meanwhile, the kitchen and its inhabitants will be pretty busy. There is even a folk rhyme to guide you through it all: Twenty-third, pumpkin candies, twenty-fourth, spring cleaning. Twenty-fifth, tofu time, twenty-sixth, make meat stew. Twenty-seventh, kill the rooster, twenty-eighth, rise the dough. Twenty-ninth, steam the buns, New Year\\\\\\'s Eve, stay up late New Year\\\\\\'s Day, celebrate! Once Zaojun leaves, replete with sticky pumpkin-shaped candies, the mops and dusters come out the next day and every dustball and each cobweb is industriously swept up and removed. The more creative among the girls will start crafting beautiful paper cut-outs from auspicious red paper. Fruits and flowers, the Chinese characters for happiness and spring, images of deer and bats and other lucky icons - all these will be pasted on windows and walls. Those with good calligraphy skills will be called upon to write couplets of good wishes that will go across lintels and door frames. All on red paper. In the meantime, an enormous amount of cooking will be done - starting with the slaughter of the chickens, ducks, pigs and goats to the soaking of soy beans for the making of tofu. Another important task is the bun making. Steamed buns are very much part of the daily diet all year round, but the buns for the New Year will be decorated with dates and shaped into impressive works of art. In my own household, Ayi and I will be creating flower buns cut from strips of dough artfully twisted into blossoms. Ayi comes from Henan, where the ladies are really good at turning dough into masterpieces of miniature architecture. She has taught me how to press dried Chinese jujubes into the dough for instant effect. The red fruits add color and flavor as well. We also make piggy buns because the pig is, of course, a symbol of prosperity. In the southern regions of China, a sticky rice cake called niangao is also prepared. The basic recipe is golden syrup and glutinous rice flour. Occasionally, red beans and coconut milk are added and the mixture poured into containers lined with bamboo or coconut leaves. These days, elaborate jelly molds are used to shape the cakes, with fish molds being the most popular because fish is homophonic with \"overflowing abudance\". At this time of the year, rituals and symbolic foods become part of the celebrations and even though some may seem to be based simply on superstitions, they are still oddly comforting and very much part of the festivities that make a new lunar year so very special. As for the Kitchen God, I\\\\\\'m pretty sure he enjoys the attention he gets every year and he never fails to return, duty completed, and ready for another year listening in on the household secrets. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn   - To worship the god, crafting paper cut-outs, fruits and flowers, images of lucky icons - all these will be pasted on windows and walls while food such as buns and desserts will be prepared.

A good number of the country\\\\\\'s more than 200 million migrant workers will return home to smaller cities and villages, bearing gifts for the children they have left behind in their pursuit of work in bigger cities. A central government survey released in November suggests China now has 9 million children at or under the age of 16 whose parents work away from their domiciles. In 2013, the All China Women Federation, a government-backed agency said the country had 60 million such children under the age of 18. Analysts say the new survey\\\\\\'s methodology is different from the previous one in terms of the children\\\\\\'s age as well as the categorization of absent parents. Some sociologists expect an actual decline in the number in coming years, with signs of more family migrations. But a recent visit to East China\\\\\\'s Anhui province, which is among the top inland areas for outward migration, showed that on the other side of the country\\\\\\'s economic boom lie villages and small towns that continue to battle a deep emotional void.   - A girl and her grandfather live in Fuyang, Anhui province.  In rural patches of Fuyang, a large municipal-level city located more than 200 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital Hefei, most residents are the elderly and their young grandchildren. Here, the working age population is simply missing. Hundreds of empty houses dotted across farmlands provide further evidence of desertion. In the Houyuan neighborhood of Wuli village, for instance, more than half of the 22 households have children in the care of their grandparents. In adjacent Dongzhou, of the settlement\\\\\\'s 65 residents, the majority face a similar situation. Local government officials estimate 2.8 million people from Fuyang\\\\\\'s population of 10 million live in different parts of the country. Guo Lin, chairwoman of the Fuyang Women\\\\\\'s Federation, says the migrants mostly move to wealthier eastern provinces, such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and Shanghai to do low-level jobs in manufacturing, services, construction and other sectors. As a result, 179,000 children under the age of 18 have been left behind in Fuyang, she says. The term used to describe such children emerged from the so-called left-behind wives whose husbands had migrated from Anhui and other provinces, such as Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei, to mainly coastal cities in the 1990s. In the following decade, the women themselves started to migrate. A large number of female domestic helpers in Beijing came from Anhui back then.    \"The 2016 survey considers the legal working age of young Chinese and of families where both parents have migrated,\" Guo says of the differences between the new central government study and ACWF\\\\\\'s 2013 survey that counted such children even when one parent was missing. Sociologists have previously also studied migration patterns in the rural reaches of relatively affluent places such as Chongqing and Guangdong province. In the Houyuan area of Fuyang\\\\\\'s Wuli village, Zhou Peisheng and his wife, Liu Guilan, have been raising their granddaughter for the past three years. The couple\\\\\\'s daughter and son-in-law are a waitress and a chef at a restaurant in Nanjing in Jiangsu province. \"It\\\\\\'s no trouble taking care of her, she isn\\\\\\'t naughty,\" Zhou says of his granddaughter, Ni Yuting, aged 9. Her parents keep long working hours, which is why Ni can\\\\\\'t live with them in Nanjing, he says. Ni wants to see her parents more often and for longer periods than just during the annual holidays. She also wants to know \"what gifts they will bring for me\". In Zhou\\\\\\'s neighborhood, most working age couples have migrated to Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, where the G20 Summit was held last year. Zhou was once a crop farmer who worked part-time at rural construction sites in Fuyang. Today, he is among the better-off people in his locality, with income coming in from growing vegetables. His daughter sends money home as well. For Song Jinlan, a 55-year-old resident of Dongzhou area in the same Wuli village, life is slightly harder. The widow has been looking after her grandson since his birth six years ago. Her son works in Hangzhou driving trucks that carry construction materials and her daughter-in-law works at a textile unit in the city. Her son sends her 1,000 yuan ($145; 136.7 euros; 120.70) a month on average, Song says. In addition, she earns some money from selling corn and other crops that she grows. In 2015, Fuyang\\\\\\'s per capita rural dispensable income was 9,001 yuan on average per year. Song\\\\\\'s son and daughter-in-law come home every Chinese New Year and stay for less than two weeks. This year the couple want to arrive ahead of the Spring Festival week to hold a ceremony to cut a few strands of long hair their son has been wearing since early childhood as a traditional symbol of good fortune. But so far, Song says, her son hasn\\\\\\'t been granted the extra leave he requested. \"Without his parents around, I sometimes feel helpless, especially when the kid falls sick,\" she says pointing to her grandson, Zhou Junhao, aged 6. In the town of Xihu, some distance from Wuli village, former schoolteacher Du Fengcai and his wife have raised two grandsons in the past 20 years. Du\\\\\\'s son, a longtime migrant who now runs a hotel in the tourist city of Dali, in Southwest China\\\\\\'s Yunnan province, can\\\\\\'t take his 13-year-old younger child along because of the limited options for education there, Du says. His older grandson, aged 22, has joined his parents\\\\\\' business in Dali. Du longs for reform of the country\\\\\\'s household registration system, or hukou, to increase the educational prospects for the children of migrant workers in host cities. While the first nine years of education are compulsory in China, the existing hukou system throws some challenges at migrants. The 2016 government survey makes mention of the reform, too. While at least 8 million grandparents form the backbone of second-generation parenting in China today, this aging group, with limited resources at its disposal, is often unable to provide the emotional support that the grandchildren, especially teenagers, need. \"Some problems of left-behind children are being solved with the country\\\\\\'s economic progress, but their psychological lives still need attention,\" says Lu Shizhen, deputy chairwoman at the China Youth and Children\\\\\\'s Research Association, a Beijing-based affiliate of the China Youth University of Political Studies. Lu advocates long-term professional counseling, not just for the affected children but also for their primary caregivers. The children of migrant couples are \"de facto orphans\", she says, adding that a mix of economic and social reasons has triggered the situation. According to the new survey, a percentage of the 9 million children largely live without adult supervision on a daily basis, effectively forcing them to stay alone. In an appalling case last year, police reported the deaths of four siblings, aged 5 to 14, in Guizhou, among the country\\\\\\'s poorest provinces. In a \"suicide note\" written before they died, the eldest said their mother, who worked in a different place, hadn\\\\\\'t visited them in a year and a half. Other than abject loneliness, unsupervised children in particular are at risk of sexual abuse. A few years ago, 19 cases of sexual assault on girls under the age of 18 were registered in Henan province, China Youth Daily reported. With the majority of \"left-behind\" children living in villages, there\\\\\\'s also a need to include more women in countryside Party committees, Lu says. Last year, the State Council, China\\\\\\'s cabinet, issued a set of guidelines for local governments to follow, including setting up more child welfare centers across the country. \"How central policies percolate down to the grassroots level is the key question,\" Lu says. That\\\\\\'s where the real implementation is necessary.

[ZHU LIXIN/CHINA DAILY]  Fan Xiaohui, 15, is among the 4 percent of 9 million \"left-behind\" children in China who are deprived of adult supervision by a close family member on a daily basis. Some sociologists argue that the percentage of such children is less than estimated but these cases, even if they are in the minority, are of grave societal concern. While she understands her mother\\\\\\'s inability to take phone calls at work, and the fact that her parents and a 10-year-old brother live in a cramped room in the capital\\\\\\'s Haidian district, Fan is working hard to cope with the psychological fallout from the family\\\\\\'s decision to send her to Fuyang to continue her education. The bespectacled girl, whose bright smile seldom betrays her pain, was born in Huzong village in the same county. When she was 3, her parents, now both in their late 30s, migrated to Beijing along with her. There she studied for a few years in a school for the children of migrant workers but eventually her parents realized Fan needed better access to resources that her hometown could provide. She was enrolled into the Central School of Huzong Township in Fuyang. In China, migrant workers aren\\\\\\'t often able to send their children to schools of their choosing in host cities because of the household registration system, or hukou. A reform of the system has been urged by many and may happen eventually. Fan lives in a furnished apartment that belongs to a relative who only occasionally stays in it. A typical weekday in her life involves waking up; going to school, which is a few minutes by foot; studying and eating meals at school; playing chess and reading Russian authors for fun; and \"meeting\" childhood friends on social media, most of whom are the so-called left-behind children. On the weekend, she visits her ailing grandfather in the nearby village of her birth, where he lives in a dilapidated house. Fan can\\\\\\'t live in it, she says, because \"it\\\\\\'s falling apart\". She doesn\\\\\\'t need to shop for groceries or cook. She washes her own clothes and does daily chores that aren\\\\\\'t unusual for any teenager. When China Daily met with her recently, the interview was brief as she was studying for an upcoming exam. Questions that could have provided a deeper glimpse into her life remain unanswered because of a shortage of time. Used to life in the big city, Fan initially struggled to adapt to her new semi-urban existence. She was afraid of living alone, she says. But her school seems to have played a significant role in easing her situation. Of a total 775 students here, 543 are children whose parents work in cities outside of Fuyang. Guan Dongkui, the principal, says his school acts as a second home for such children. \"We help them fight loneliness.\" Fan\\\\\\'s parents and sibling usually visit her during the weeklong Spring Festival holiday. She also travels to Beijing when schools close for the summer. \"I don\\\\\\'t have real dreams yet because dreaming isn\\\\\\'t always practical,\" she says with the wisdom of a person who has been forced to grow up early. But Fan isn\\\\\\'t totally dismissive of the future either. She would like to travel the world if she makes enough money, she says. Zhu Lixin contributed to this story.

They are now hoping that well-wishers can help him complete the treatment and give him the chance of a better life. Li Xianyu, 68, discovered the child she later named Zhao Xuecheng under a bridge in Xiangyang, Hubei province, in 1994. \"It was around Spring Festival and it was snowing,\" she recalls, adding that she had been on her way home from selling vegetables and heard the soft crying of a baby. She searched a nearby bush and found the child.   - Zhao Xuecheng, whose face was severely burned during his childhood, longs for a normal life. Ran Wen / For China Daily  \"His face was totally burned, so much so that I could hardly tell his facial features,\" she says. \"I immediately realized he\\\\\\'d been abandoned.\" Li took the child home to her husband, Zhao Liniu. He recalls: \"I was afraid the baby would die at any minute due to his severe wounds.\" They named him Xuecheng, which means \"happening in snow\".    After the Spring Festival holiday, the couple took the boy to a hospital but could not afford the cost of plastic surgery, which would have been tens of thousands of yuan. They barely made ends meet by planting and selling vegetables and had little money saved. So they bought some medicine and fed him milk powder and rice soup. After three months, the scars on the boy\\\\\\'s face began to heal. When he reached the age of 7, he was rejected by schools because of his appearance. Finally, one accepted him but he could not bear the discrimination and bullying and dropped out a year later. The couple, who only had primary school education themselves, taught him at home. When their vegetable business struggled, they began picking through garbage for recyclables to make money. Zhao Xuecheng is now 22 but has been unable to find work because of his disfigurement, Li says. \"We are getting old and he has to making a living by himself. All we can do is use our savings, 30,000 yuan ($4,370; 4,085 euros; 3,542), to get him the surgery he needs.\" This month, the family arrived at Chongqing\\\\\\'s Southwest Hospital affiliated with the Third Military Medical School. The 30,000 yuan covered the cost of the first surgery. Now their son is out of the hospital and in six months he will have another operation, which is expected to cost more than 80,000 yuan. After the couple\\\\\\'s plight was reported by local media, donations began pouring in to help cover the medical bills, Li says. tanyingzi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page15)\\'\\n \\'It\\\\\\'s a chilling prospect and it\\\\\\'s just the beginning of the men\\\\\\'s downhill course in St. Moritz. The start hut is cut into a rock face and the slick slope is so steep -- 100% or 45 degrees -- TV cameramen must abseil into positions wearing crampons. But the one skier able to conquer their fear and harness this breakneck speed will be crowned world downhill champion for the next two years. The race is the highlight of the 2017 World Championships, which start this week in the chic Swiss town. St. Moritz, the jewel of the Engadin valley, has been a longtime destination for the jetset and draws a well-heeled international clientele to its fine-dining restaurants and five-star hotels.  Often dubbed the \"home of winter sports,\" St. Moritz has hosted two Winter Olympics and four previous World Championships. A total of 600 athletes from more than 70 countries will compete across six alpine skiing disciplines -- slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill, super combined (downhill and slalom) and the team event. Outside of the Olympics, it\\\\\\'s the biggest event in the sport and carries more cachet than the World Cup circuit. \"It\\\\\\'s winning, basically, the Olympics minus all the other sports -- that\\\\\\'s what the World Championships is for us. It\\\\\\'s big,\" Mikaela Shiffrin, who leads the World Cup overall and slalom standings, told CNN\\\\\\'s Alpine Edge. The 21-year-old American is going for a third straight slalom world title after winning gold in Schladming in 2013 and Beaver Creek two years ago. She also won the Olympic slalom gold in 2014, and is aware she has set herself a very high benchmark. \"Not winning stinks -- it makes me feel like I\\\\\\'ve done something wrong,\" Shiffrin adds. But the headline attraction will be her compatriot Lindsey Vonn, the second most successful ski racer of all time -- male or female -- with 77 World Cup wins, behind only Sweden\\\\\\'s Ingemar Stenmark (86). Speed queen Vonn, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion, won her only world title in 2009 and is back on the circuit following a broken arm and severe nerve damage to her right hand sustained in a crash shortly after returning from knee surgery. Vonn won in only her second race since returning to the circuit in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany in January, but crashed in a downhill at Cortina d\\\\\\'Ampezzo in Italy this month. In St. Moritz Tuesday, she skied out during the opening run of the World Championships\\\\\\' first race -- the women\\\\\\'s super-G -- after trying to regain grip on her pole. \"I just kind of lost my concentration there for a minute,\" Vonn, the 2015 bronze medalist, told reporters. \"I stayed on my feet, so that was the important thing.\" Austria\\\\\\'s Nicole Schmidhofer won the gold medal from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein and home favorite Lara Gut in perfect conditions, after two days of heavy snow had canceled the men\\\\\\'s and women\\\\\\'s downhill training sessions. Defending champion and Olympic gold medalist Anna Veith didn\\\\\\'t make the second run after missing a gate. The women\\\\\\'s downhill start is lower than the men\\\\\\'s but still a considerable test of skill and stamina. Vonn\\\\\\'s main rivals on Sunday will be World Cup overall champion Gut and Slovenia\\\\\\'s Ilka Stuhec, this season\\\\\\'s World Cup downhill leader. Another Slovenian Tina Maze, who has since retired, won the world title in 2015. The men\\\\\\'s downhill takes place Saturday on the legendary \"Free Fall\" course, which was dreamed up by Bernhard Russi, the Swiss two-time downhill world champion and 1972 Olympic gold medalist.

Switzerland\\\\\\'s Patrick Kung is the defending champion, but Italy\\\\\\'s Peter Fill won the 2015-16 World Cup title and leads the standings this season. Norway\\\\\\'s Kjetil Jansrud and Italian Dominik Paris, the winner in Kitzbuhel, are second and third in the World Cup standings. Former wold junior champion Beat Feuz triumphed at St. Moritz last year and the 29-year-old Swiss skier could improve on his World Championship bronze from Beaver Creek in 2015. The men\\\\\\'s slalom on February 19 is likely to be a shootout between Austria\\\\\\'s Marcel Hirscher and Sweden\\\\\\'s Henrik Kristofferson. Hirscher, 27, has won four World Championship golds and a record five overall World Cup titles, while 22-year-old Kristofferson is last year\\\\\\'s World Cup slalom champion. It is worth keeping an eye on Briton Dave Ryding, who has been making waves after scoring his country\\\\\\'s joint best result in a World Cup race with a second place in the slalom in Kitzbuhel last month. He equaled the achievement of Konrad Bartelski in a downhill in Val Gardena, Italy in 1981. Ryding followed it up with 10th in the Schladming night slalom and sits fifth in the World Cup slalom standings.

But instead of flying, she spends most of her time meeting passengers arriving at Beijing Capital International Airport in her role as a \"pickup assistant\" - a new job that has arisen along with the demand for mobile ride-hailing. \"Our job is to help car-hailers find the rides they have booked as soon as they get off planes. Most of them are first-time visitors to Beijing,\" says Gong, one of more than 170 people who have landed this type of job. Their services are used heavily by Didi Chuxing, China\\\\\\'s largest ride-hailing platform.   Gong Xiaopei, a \"pickup assistant\", contacts passengers at Beijing Capital International Airport in December. Wang Zhuangfei / For China Daily  As China steps up efforts to restructure its economy, the country\\\\\\'s burgeoning digital sector is creating new jobs for millions of people like Gong. Besides \"pickup assistants\", other new titles include \"cyber anchors\" who rake in as much as 1,000 yuan ($145; 136 euros; 120) a day by live streaming advice on such subjects as playing electronic games, map information collectors who drive around China collecting road data, and purchasing agents who help Chinese buy products in foreign countries. Zhang Dayi, 28, a former model, is one of the cyber celebrities who have made it big in the country\\\\\\'s booming digital marketplace. She opened a shop in 2014 on Taobao, Alibaba Group\\\\\\'s online marketplace. By offering a range of online advice to women on makeup, hairdos and wardrobes, she accumulated over 4.5 million fans on Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter. Her fans are eager to mimic Zhang\\\\\\'s wardrobe, overwhelming her shop whenever new designs are released. In November, 5,000 garments were sold within two seconds on Zhang\\\\\\'s store, equivalent to the annual sales of a small brick-and-mortar store. These new jobs are particularly popular among young people who put a premium on freedom and flexibility when considering careers, says Shen Meng, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in China. \"Compared with previous generations, who prioritized salaries, young people are increasingly in favor of positions that are intertwined with their hobbies,\" Shen says. Experts say that these jobs are so new that many people know little about them or how to break into one of the new fields. A survey by QQ browser, owned by Tencent Holdings, showed that only about 3.8 percent of 13,000 university students born after 1995 indicated a preference for new jobs created by the digital economy. However, among those interested, cyber anchors, voice actors and game testers were among the jobs most desired. The push to crack down on pornography on the internet has also given rise to a new profession. Jiao Yi, CEO of iweiju, a Guangzhou-based startup that develops social networking apps, says almost every internet content firm in China has recruited people to delete inappropriate user-generated content, with some firms recruiting as many as 50 so-called \"porn-detectors\". The digital economy is breathing new life into many traditional industries that have struggled with declining growth. Thanks to the e-commerce boom, for instance, China\\\\\\'s logistics industry has been creating an average of 200,000 new jobs annually in recent years, says Ma Junsheng, head of the State Postal Bureau, the industry regulator. In 2015, about 113 million Chinese worked in businesses driven by China\\\\\\'s digital economy, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. \"As information technologies continue to revolutionize the retail, entertainment, finance, manufacturing and other industries, China\\\\\\'s digital economy will reach $16 trillion by 2035, with 415 million jobs created accumulatively,\" the report forecasts. That\\\\\\'s up from $1.4 trillion in 2015. \"If not for the robust growth of the internet and the sharing economy, China would have been under unprecedented employment pressure, weighed down by slowing GDP growth,\" says Zhang Yansheng, director of the National Development and Reform Commission\\\\\\'s Institute for International Economics Research. \"Digital businesses are not taking jobs away from traditional sectors. They are creating new jobs,\" he adds. masi@chinadaily.com.cn   ( China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page14)\\'\\n \\'Huge plan will aid in Belt and Road development, increase opportunities and employment The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region will inject record funding into building new roads this year so it can better serve as China\\\\\\'s trade hub linking countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt. New infrastructure projects are also expected to bring more job opportunities for locals, the region\\\\\\'s top economic planning official says. This year, the northwestern region will invest 170 billion yuan ($24.8 billion; 23.1 billion euros; 20.1 billion) on new roads, up nearly six fold from 2016. The region has never seen such investment in road construction, Zhang Chunlin, director of the Xinjiang Development and Reform Commission, says in an exclusive interview in the regional capital of Urumqi. The region will also invest 8.1 billion yuan in constructing railways and 4.8 billion yuan in civil aviation projects, both up by 50 percent from last year. The investment in roads, railways and airports this year will top the total funding for transportation infrastructure from 2011 to 2015.    Building a highway network in a region that takes up a sixth of China\\\\\\'s territory is a priority, Zhang says. Currently, about 40 percent of the cities and counties in Xinjiang are not connected by highways. \"Without the highways, oil, coal and agricultural products of Xinjiang cannot be shipped out of the region smoothly, and logistics costs will remain high,\" Zhang says. After the planned highway network is completed, logistics costs in the region can be reduced by 30 percent, he adds. The region plans to start construction this year on 6,096 kilometers of highways. Although poor infrastructure has been holding back development of the region, Xinjiang now sees opportunity for economic growth. Massive transportation projects can use significant amounts of steel and concrete, which can help to stimulate economic growth. What\\\\\\'s more, locals can fill the jobs created by those projects, he adds. Currently, there is one highway linking Xinjiang and other parts of China to the east. The roads now connecting the region and China\\\\\\'s neighbors to the west cannot meet the demands of future trade. Zhang believes that without the support of transportation, becoming the trade hub on the Silk Road Economic Belt is not feasible, so Xinjiang must face the challenge head-on. The central government sees Xinjiang, which borders countries including Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Mongolia, as the key trade center on the economic belt. The economic belt, part of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to revive the ancient trade route. Xinjiang also plans to begin research on a high-speed railway connecting Urumqi and Horgos, a land port on the China-Kazakhstan border. Additionally, Urumqi International Airport will be expanded to cope with surging domestic and international traffic.

In 1955, Zhou, then an economics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, was asked by the central government to quit his job and join a national committee to develop an accessible alphabetic writing system. It took him and his colleagues three years to devise the official Romanization system, which was adopted in 1958. Since then, pinyin - which can be translated as \"spelled sounds\" - has helped to considerably increase literacy across the country, and has made it easier for foreigners to study the Chinese language. It has also facilitated the use of Chinese characters on computer keyboards and cellphones: pinyin is entered on a keyboard, and users are given a choice of characters. \"The committee\\\\\\'s work was extremely important to establishing a modern country because about 85 percent of Chinese people were illiterate when New China was founded,\" Zhou recalled in one of his many reference books. He later lectured at Peking University and Renmin University of China on linguistics. In the early 1980s, Zhou participated in a successful campaign proposing pinyin as the international standard spelling for Chinese. It is considered superior to the Wade-Giles system, developed in the 19th century and widely used until the 1980s. Zhou also worked with other scholars to translate the Encyclopedia Britannica into Chinese. \"Mr Zhou was a great scholar whose knowledge has spread from East to West,\" says Su Peicheng, a linguistics professor at Peking University. \"He was the founder of the theory of modern learning for the Chinese language.\" Zhou was born in 1906 in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, and in 1923 enrolled at the prestigious St John\\\\\\'s University in Shanghai. There, he majored in economics and also took courses in linguistics. In 1933 he went to Japan to further his economics studies, but returned to Shanghai two years later when Sino-Japanese ties became tense. After World War II ended, he worked as a banker in the United States but in 1949 he chose to return to China shortly after New China was founded. He joked about his longevity on his birthday in 2013: \"God is so busy. He has forgotten me.\" Zhou was married for nearly 70 years to Zhang Yunhe, who came from a legendary literary family in Hefei, Anhui province. Zhang died in 2002 at the age of 94. The couple had a daughter who died as a child and a son, Zhou Xiaoping, a meteorologist, who died in 2015 at age 82. wangkaihao@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page14)\\'\\n \\'My recent piece of work on de-globalization and China-WTO issues was published by China Daily and picked up by Eureporter. I received lots of feedback, either favoring globalization or against Chinese social-economic-political directions and its \"fake\" stance of openness, non-discrimination, and equality.... The opponents\\\\\\' opinions are strong but I am actually very pleased to see China become the subject of discussion. It shows how much attention it has generated, which might ironically be at a similar level to that which emerged after Brexit and the Trump victory. It looks like we won\\\\\\'t be bored this century and deprived of tremendous transitions and changes. The Western world and its media, most of the time, don\\\\\\'t reflect what the real China was and is, and don\\\\\\'t understand seemingly-complicated Chinese phenomena. It is disappointing to see that many opinions from the West are influenced by the media, so that its citizens, politicians and decision-makers have been sadly misled about China\\\\\\'s comprehensive phenomena for example on the recent topic of China\\\\\\'s (non) market status on WTO regulations. Even so, I believe we should have a shot at understanding to those opinions.  As a deep believer in Buddhism and Taoism, with which most Chinese were born with and raised, discrimination is not at the root of our values. On the contrary, we value connectiveness and collectivism, cooperation and the toleration of differences. Chinese culture was not cultivated to judge others by using its own value system. Neither, I believe, do our friends in the West. However, it does not always appear to be so. Why is that? How is it that we can share the same fundamental belief in doing the best for our people but at an institutional level we grow apart? The majority of people in the West do not have enough information on what China is and where it has been, which influences the way the country is seen and understood. Some raise the issues of freedom, equality and openness as a \"weapon\" to judge Chinese performance and its role and contribution to globalization and world prosperity. Do they understand the sacrifices and costs that China has paid? At times, those biased attitudes and opinions have been too extreme and too shallow. We were born differently and developed differently but we have the honor of co-existing on the same planet with certain rules. We need to respect the rules and continue to develop positive energy to improve things for the sake of this planet\\\\\\'s wellbeing.  Those wrongly using and supporting the concept of so called anti-discrimination and equality should open their eyes and take a step back to review the antecedents and consequences of real discrimination and inequality in some countries. Discrimination comes from inequality and should be prioritized for discussion at a global level. Why are some countries / people chosen to make rules and some countries / people chosen to be badly or unfairly treated? Why are some countries / people arrogant to order others about? We should learn to respect others and not forcibly impose our values on them. China 1,500 years ago was ruled by the Tang Dynasty and that era was its most prosperous, as the largest economic and civilization contributor to the world. Openness to the world, the embracing of variety and collaboration were default values, similar to what USA has done for the past 300 years and the EU agreed to cherish when it was set up. Discrimination was disapproved of in China\\\\\\'s Tang Dynasty and onwards. Countries trading with China were well-treated, not just as friends and partners, but as family. Prosperity was sought together and evil thoughts were fought together. However, during China\\\\\\'s Qing dynasty 300 years ago, anti-globalization and protectionism dominated and bloodily dragged the wealthy dragon back to nothing, as a nobody. People were extremely poor, without status and identity. The country was plundered and lost its dignity. The story of our shared history is cruel but true. It clearly mirrors the present and accurately predicts the future. When we look at history, the only variables for us to consider are the time and the mentality. So what does this tell us about de-globalization? How should we adjust our values, thoughts and behavior to become more responsible and moral, and create a virtuous path for the benefit of us all?

The term was coined just over a decade ago to pinpoint the day - usually the third Monday of January - calculated to be the most depressing in the year. According to a formula credited to a British academic, bad weather, post-holiday debt and the failure to keep New Year\\\\\\'s resolutions all combine to make it the most miserable day of the year. The giveaway is that this bit of pseudoscience was first revealed in a press release from a travel company seeking to boost early bookings of summer holidays.    So, Blue Monday turns out to be just another marketing ploy, just like Black Friday or Cyber Monday or any other of those shop-till-you-drop dates that have invaded the modern calendar. Maybe that is the most depressing thing of all. Unlike those other commercial fixtures, Blue Monday is not really exportable beyond the Western world. Although many in Europe and North America will need no reminding that it is a gloomy time of the year, much of the world is basking in the sunshine. In China, 1.4 billion people are gearing up for the extended Spring Festival celebrations, the most fun part of the year. It\\\\\\'s all a matter of perspective. To quote President Xi Jinping quoting Charles Dickens during his speech this week at Davos: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" Just as the Industrial Revolution had disrupted Dickens\\\\\\' world, so economic globalization had created new problems, Xi acknowledged. But that was no reason to write it off. Sadly, however, many in the West do appear to have written it off as we risk lapsing into a chronic funk that will extend well beyond Blue Monday. With uncertainties provoked by Donald Trump\\\\\\'s election victory, Brexit in the UK and the rise of inward-looking populist parties elsewhere in Europe, it seems that everyone is in a sulk - even the winners. In the US, the victor barely scraped an approval rating of 40 percent - a historic low - just days before his inauguration. Trump\\\\\\'s characteristic reaction was to claim the poll was rigged.    In Britain, those who successfully backed the country\\\\\\'s exit from the European Union continue to groan and gripe at the merest suggestion that Brexit might be watered down. One reason for the widespread blues is that one half of the population in the US and Europe is being dragged down a populist path not of its choosing and fears the consequences. Meanwhile, the other half, who cast their votes for promised change, were in fact voting for things to stay the same, or indeed to revert to some idealized past. And nothing ever stays quite the same. It is perfectly rational for those who have lost their jobs or seen their incomes decline - in the last decade the latter includes nearly all but the 1 percent who are super-rich - to blame a system in which the winners take all. What is less rational or acceptable is to blame one\\\\\\'s ills on immigrants and foreigners and trade competitors. That is the mark of a reactionary revolution, not a progressive one. The one-percenters gathered in Davos have been hearing that vastly more jobs are currently threatened by automation and robotization than by more open foreign trade. Their challenge is to ensure that the benefits of this new industrial revolution are evenly spread. Technology can be liberating, rather than enslaving. It just has to be done right and that should be the object of voters\\\\\\' demands. In the meantime, don\\\\\\'t despair. As the days get longer and the credit card bill gets shorter, bin the happy pills, look on the bright side and count your blessings. Blue Monday is only supposed to last one day.

(China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page11)\\'\\n \"China has transformed from a capital importing country to a capital exporting one. This is an important characteristic of the new normal of the Chinese economy. The latest statistics show China\\'s current foreign exchange reserve is $3.05 trillion (2.87 trillion euros; 2.48 trillion), nearly $1 trillion lower than its peak in June 2014. Investing abroad has been a growing trend for both enterprises and individuals. Chinese enterprises have never been so passionate about investing in foreign capital markets, and they have become one of the largest sources of global investment. Individual investors have shown a similar desire for going out. Investments are made in overseas assets and children studying abroad. Some wealthy individuals have also sought to move their fortunes overseas in a bid to evade the yuan\\'s depreciation. First, wealthy Chinese buy homes. Later, they buy foreign insurance products, and invest in hedge funds or foreign stock markets. Money from Chinese investors creates business opportunities for other economies. To some extent, the surge of house prices in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia is related to the influx of Chinese investors. Home buyers from the Chinese mainland have not only boosted these countries\\' property markets, they have also created jobs and promoted local economic growth. People from the mainland also buy life insurance and investment dividend-returning insurance, especially in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which has undoubtedly given impetus to the development of the offshore financial market in Hong Kong. Currently, people can directly open accounts abroad and invest in overseas stock markets, as well as financial products for Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors. Along with the opening-up of China\\'s capital market, individual Chinese nationals are becoming an important customer source for the wealth management industry in some economies. In this process, investors are increasing their input in overseas stock markets and funds, which undoubtedly fosters the development of financial markets in the countries concerned. In the future, exchange rate fluctuation and the decline in the return on investments at home will make more Chinese nationals want to invest abroad.    A survey of Chinese families by the Financial Times last year shows that 56.8 percent of those sampled said they would increase their overseas assets in the next two years, and investing abroad is no longer exclusive to the very rich. More and more Chinese families with a disposable income of between 600,000 yuan ($87,000; 81,300 euros; 70,000) and 6 million yuan are investing overseas. There are certainly some uncertainties and risks behind the investments. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, housing prices, tax policy changes, etc. Some foreign insurance is not protected by Chinese laws and foreign stock markets are by no means safe harbors. But the momentum of Chinese residents investing abroad will continue this year. And their capital will inject continuous vitality into overseas housing, insurance and stock markets, foster local economic growth and create jobs. Yet Brexit, Donald Trump\\'s stepping into power as US president and the forthcoming elections in France and Germany will increase uncertainties in these markets and Chinese investors will have to pay even more attention to their risk assessments this year than before. They will need to ensure they are fully informed so they can control potential risks and make rational investment decisions. The author is a partner in the Yongshi Fund Management Company.

Just about every British schoolboy of my generation knows that one. Xi also pitched in with a remark, which resonates in Chinese and British culture - that there\\\\\\'s no such thing as a free lunch. Churchill, of course, took over as leader of a nation fighting the fascism of Nazi Germany and his key quotes have gone into the history books.    He had nothing, he said, to offer the British people, except \"blood, toil, tears and sweat,\" adding in his characteristic growl \"we shall never surrender\". The Free French leader General Charles de Gaulle, who later became president, despaired of the antics of his fellow-countrymen - \"how can you govern a country that has 246 different kinds of cheese.\" Legendary Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was the master of the catchphrase - his coining of the agreement covering the return to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong as being \"one country, two systems\" was, and remains, a masterpiece. Mao Zedong was the master of the one-line aphorism - off the top of my head I remember, \"In waking a tiger use a long stick\" and \"Women hold up half the sky.\" I guess the point here is that an experienced leader, no matter what his political persuasion, knows the power of a catchy quote. Disgraced US president Richard Nixon, seeking to justify some of his more questionable decisions while in office, once memorably declared: \"If the president does it, it is not illegal.\" He lived to regret that remark after being forced to resign in disgrace in 1974 ahead of almost certain impeachment and dismissal from office, the only president to do so. Of course, in this modern age of 24-hour news and digital information channels, the race is on for the sound bite that grabs attention. Some 43 years after I first heard it, one quote by a US Air Force major still has me flummoxed.    It was December 1972 and the US was desperate to conclude a peace deal that would extract it from the morass of the Vietnam War - Peace With Honour, as Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger would call it. The North Vietnamese, headed by Le Duc Tho, were digging their heels in and by mid-December they refused to set a date for further talks in Paris after South Vietnamese demands, in their view, made a deal impossible. Nixon and Kissinger resorted to the old adage: \"Bomb them to the conference table.\" In an operation dubbed Linebacker II, huge US B-52 bombers blitzed targets in Hanoi and surrounding areas, killing more than 1,600 people and causing widespread damage to infrastructure. At this point, let me introduce Major Jere Forbus, an amiable officer who handled press conferences, dubbed the Five o\\\\\\'Clock Follies, in a disused movie theatre in downtown Saigon. Here\\\\\\'s the thing - time zones and mid-20th century creaky communications meant the Saigon press crowd was baying for news of the bombing campaign, which had not been officially released by the Americans. An exasperated New York correspondent stood up and said - I remember the question to this day: \"Major, you know you\\\\\\'re bombing, the North Vietnamese know you\\\\\\'re bombing, so why won\\\\\\'t you tell us?\" Came back the immortal quote from Forbus - \"That\\\\\\'s protection of information.\" It is, of course, the supreme example of the spokesman\\\\\\'s art of obfuscation. Years later, I tracked down a retired Forbus to his home in Washington. I asked him what he had meant. As genial as ever, he smiled, and said: \"I had to tell you guys something. Have another beer.\" I am still in the dark. Chris Peterson is managing editor of China Daily European Bureau. Contact the writer at chris@mail.chinadailyuk.com.

China has huge development projects in this region, involving billions of dollars of investment and trade. In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative, signifying multidirectional cooperation between Eastern and Western countries throughout Central Asia and the Caucasus region. In March 2015, China declared its Visions and Actions on Jointly Building the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road. Azerbaijan is the pivotal point of the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor. The country has a long history of welcoming merchants from land and sea due to its proximity to Asia and Europe since the time of the ancient Silk Road. If we look back, the first merchant route between the Roman Empire and Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) China emerged in the first century BC in Azerbaijan.    The Silk Road Economic Belt comprises 6 corridors which connect five central Asian countries, Iran and the Persian Gulf region, Transcaucasia, Turkey and the Saudi Arabian peninsula. Traditionally, trade between China and West Asia takes place mostly via maritime routes, and the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor is a land-based substitute for these traditional routes. The shortest way to approach West Asia from China is via Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was the safest of the old routes in the 5th century BC. Barda (about 250 km west of Baku) was the old capital of Azerbaijan, a trading hub on the ancient Silk Road. China is the manufacturer of the world\\'s fastest and most luxurious trains and a rail track is already operational from Aktau and Turkmenbashi, transporting goods to the New Baku International Sea Trade Port and then westward to Turkey and Europe. In August 2015, the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route was launched; the Nomad Express, carrying goods from China\\'s Shihezi, traveled through the port of Aktau and arrived at Baku. The North-South Transport Corridor is under construction and will connect Iran and Russia, providing road access from Indian Ocean countries to Europe and Central Asia.    China has been promoting the interconnection routes to the west of the Caspian Sea. Both China and Azerbaijan have strong links in the construction of railway tracks for transporting oil and gas. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is a major initiative of Azerbaijan to supply oil and gas to Georgia and countries in Europe. The Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline is another project supplying oil and gas to satisfy the demands of Europe. Azerbaijan has signed agreements for multiple trans-Caspian international transport routes with Kazakhstan and Georgia, and even initiated the Trans Caspian transport consortium to operate the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route from China to Europe. Azerbaijan is a major supporter of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia project, initiated by the EU and considered the backbone of the Silk Road. History is being repeated and the Chinese vision of One Belt One Road is getting an extraordinary response from countries along the ancient route. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway has been dubbed the Iron Silk Road. China has initiated the Silk Road Fund, for which Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will allocate enormous sums for the construction of these international corridors. According to estimates, the trans-Caspian route could be transporting around 300,000-400,000 containers by 2020, bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars. Relations between China and Azerbaijan are growing fast and Azerbaijan has great potential to become a valuable partner in the Silk Road project - one of the great initiatives of the 21th century.

A real economy that provides products and services is the key to a country\\'s economic success and the finance industry should serve its development. Due to information asymmetry, security problems and restrictions on time and space, the traditional finance sector presents many barriers to serving the real economy. However, in recent years, the appearance of Fintech (financial technology) has brought new opportunities. Fintech refers to the technologies that can be used in the financial sector to help traditional companies innovate, such as the mobile internet, big data, cloud computing and the blockchain. It could help solve problems that traditional financing may have. Technology could be the main driver for financial innovation, which would then stimulate consumption and encourage the development of businesses, especially small and medium-sized companies, and then boost the development of the real economy. Financial products and services using Fintech would be more efficient and of higher quality compared with their traditional counterparts. Fintech would greatly influence some key aspects of the finance industry, such as risk, leverage and credit.    First, Fintech would make products and services safer and more efficient to support the real economy. For example, the common use of online payment tools such as Alipay and Wechat wallet, increases the efficiency of transactions and lowers costs. Moreover, a financial services system based on blockchain technology will make data produced by companies more accurate. Accurate data will greatly improve the efficiency of companies\\' operations. Second, Fintech will improve China\\'s economic and consumption structure. The upgrading of industrial and consumption structure is a key element in China\\'s supply-side reform. Under the current traditional financial system, consumers face problems borrowing and companies find it difficult to get loans from banks. One report showed that in 2016 consumer credit accounted for only around 5 percent of the whole credit market, which is about 30 percent lower than the rate for developed countries. By the end of 2015, China had more than 20 million companies and 54 million self-employed entrepreneurs, but only about 10 percent of them were able to get loans from the banks. Fintech provides a solution to this. In the individual consumption sector, credit instruments have become quite commonly used. For example, internet retail giant JD.com has launched an online financial service which allows consumers to borrow money for purchases and, if they pay it back within 30 days, pay no interest. For companies, there are many peer-to-peer lending platforms emerging in China, which are based on big data. With Fintech, these p2p platforms could collect money from individuals and then lend to companies and individuals, based on an evaluation of their information, which would also increase the quality and efficiency of financial activities. In the end, Fintech would provide a better way of avoiding risk, which is important to the stable development of financial activities. The application of big data in the financial industry will make it easier to develop reliable risk control systems, which could supplement more traditional risk control systems based on the financial reports. If a company is likely to commit financial fraud, big data from online transactions, payments and other related issues could predict such a situation. This could help improve the financial institutions\\' ability to assess default risks.

China\\\\\\'s firm attitude toward engaging in global climate change prevention will inject confidence amid a rising division between pro-globalization and anti-globalization.\" Xie Zhenhua, China\\\\\\'s special envoy for climate change, who has participated in United Nations conferences on the subject, said in an exclusive interview with China Daily. \"Employment is vital to people\\\\\\'s livelihood and provides core support for developing our economy. The importance of employment cannot be overestimated. With jobs, there is income, and hence a basis for innovation, stability and development. We want sound momentum going forward, and sound jobs are a start.\" Li Keqiang, premier, said at a State Council executive meeting on Jan 18. \"It\\\\\\'s better that the country builds a unified early warning system for smog, instead of having separate releases from the weather and environmental departments. The environmental authorities should take the lead on this.\" Xie Shaodong, professor of environmental sciences at Peking University, said after the meteorological authorities announced it will no longer release separate smog alerts.  (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page2)\\'\\n \\'There is art in science -- the artistic precision of the scalpel, the cool aesthetics of the laboratory, and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world. Bio-art, an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s, solidifies, extends and enriches this organic relationship. According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey, it represents: \"a crossover of art and the biological sciences, with living matter, such as genes, cells or animals, as its new media.\" Bio-artists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space; bringing living and dead matter into the gallery. They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities. In BioCouture, for example, fashion, art, and biology are weaved together, blossoming new materials into existence. As author Suzanne Anker has noted, \"Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have invented dresses made from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine. Suzanne Lee composes \\\\\\'growing\\\\\\' textiles produced by sugar, tea and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos.\" Lee makes jackets out of cellulose produced by bacteria in baths of green tea and sugar. Bio-art includes the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video, the membranes of sound, and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs. To take another example, in Christian B?k\\\\\\'s The Xenotext, a \"chemical alphabet\" is used to translate poetry into sequences of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium. When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell, the poetry constitutes a set of instructions, all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response. Writes B?k: \"I am, in effect, engineering a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem \"-one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes...\" Scientists and artists work together in what become teeming new spaces of co-creation. Together, they often set Bio-art within current debates and concerns about what constitutes life, what counts as a sentient being, and who gets to determine what lives are saved, exploited or destroyed. Bio-art draws together the hopes and concerns of scientists and artists as we hurtle into an age where human life and everyday living seems to be undergoing radical and sometimes dangerous transformations. As author Sheel Patel suggests in relation to Bok\\\\\\'s work: \"If a living cell can be cultured to spit out and produce novel poetry, could we eventually live in a society where humans are no longer needed to produce new thoughts, and works of literature?\" Arts and disease In the interactive art-science exhibition Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts, actual and metaphoric communicative diseases are employed to explore the often toxic relationship between human and non-human life. The exhibition explores the thin doorway that exists between life and death in a vexing age of species and habitat destruction, and the increasingly permeable tissues of contemporary bodies. The discourses of science in particular train us to see and to look for disease in every location. Science\\\\\\'s microscopic and bio-technological powers allow it to reach into every atom. Of course, dominant discourse also communes that some spaces, things, and objects are more diseased than others. We are taught to see disease in the homes of outsiders and the nests of insects, in the fabric of pariah nation states and the tissues of certain religions and philosophies. At the same time, new materialism and animal philosophy question the very parameters of what life is, where it can be found, and they turn the question of disease onto humankind, whose activities are seen to infect all that it touches and taints. There is a frightening collision, then, between the possibilities and limitations of human and non-human life: caught as it were between nightmare and dream. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is composed of 11 artistic works, with each piece using a different media or art form to explore the chaos of the world it draws upon. Each artist imagines disease differently, and yet within the terror of their imaginings there is great beauty, and much hope. In Drew Berry\\\\\\'s video projection, infectious cells are \"set free\" so that the very connective tissue of the exhibition room teems with the droplets of life and death. Herpes, influenza, HIV, polio and smallpox bacteria are projected onto the gallery wall as if they have taken flight. Magnified and chaotic, those entering the space are hit by their scale and size. Lienors Torre\\\\\\'s multimedia and glass work on degenerative vision explores how our view of the world is metered and tainted by digital technologies. We see two large glass eyeballs, a liquid animation, and a glass cabinet full of jars filled with water in varying degrees of opacity, with engraved eye images on them. Eyes quickly become raindrops as the liquidity of vision is brought to watery life. There are tears and scars that reflect across the eyes of this exquisite art-piece. In Alison Bennett\\\\\\'s touch-based screen work, the viewer is presented with a high-resolution scan of bruised skin. Viewers can use the touch-screen to manipulate the soft and damaged tissue before them, and their eyes become organs of touch. What does it feel like to touch a bruise and be bruised? The gallery is thus, both laboratory and studio. In all its variant forms, and with a scalpel and a paintbrush to hand, Bio-art fashions the world anew. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is currently exhibited at the RMIT Gallery until February 18, 2017.\\'\\n \\'- Heading home for festive fun: A family of three from Jiangxi province head home on a motorcycle for Lunar New Year celebrations in Jinjiang, Fujian province, on Jan 18.

China reiterates support for EU integration China reiterated its support for continued European integration after US President-elect Donald Trump\\\\\\'s comments on the process ignited concerns in Europe. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news briefing in Beijing on Jan 17 that China hopes to see a Europe that is prosperous and open, and which remains united and stable. Hua made the remarks when asked to comment on Trump\\\\\\'s hailing of the United Kingdom\\\\\\'s decision to exit the European Union, as well as the strong reactions it has stirred up in Europe. Premier stresses focus on research, innovation Premier Li Keqiang pledged to grant universities and research institutions more independence in teaching and research, and to raise subsidies for graduate students pursuing master\\\\\\'s degrees or doctorates, as part of efforts to boost basic research and innovation. The premier was speaking at a meeting on Jan 16 to solicit suggestions for the annual Government Work Report in March from representatives in the fields of education, science, culture, sports and healthcare as well as startup businesses, according to a statement released on Jan 17. Li vowed to continue the national strategy of innovation-driven development and to implement a policy that gives universities and research institutes more room to make self-determined choices on classes and research. Abe accused of \\\\\\'sowing discord\\\\\\' in region China slammed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\\\\\'s act of \"sowing discord\" during his tour of four Asia-Pacific countries, saying it displayed \"an extremely unhealthy mentality\". Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the remarks on Jan 16 after The Philippine Star quoted Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte as saying he had declined an offer by Abe to provide missiles to the Philippines. Abe was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in Manila that \"the issue of the South China Sea is linked directly to regional peace and stability, and is a concern to the entire international community\". Hua dismissed Abe\\\\\\'s behavior as showing \"ulterior motives\". Hospital sees medical tourist increasing An online network of hospitals is turning the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region into an attractive destination for medical tourists from Central Asia, health officials said. The system, launched in the summer, allows patients seeking treatment overseas to consult Chinese doctors for free and book other services, such as flights, airport pickups, accommodation and even city tours. The network is the latest effort by health authorities in Urumqi to boost the lure of the region to tourists through improved medical services. Additives, contamination are top food concerns Overuse of food additives and microbial contamination were the primary food safety problems facing China last year, according to the top food authority. The two together accounted for more than 64 percent of all food safety problems found in random inspections by the China Food and Drug Administration, Yan Jiangying, spokeswoman for the administration, announced on Jan 16. In addition, food products manufactured and sold by large companies are less likely to be substandard, Yan said, suggesting consumers buy food from reputable outlets. IMF fixes projection of nation\\\\\\'s growth The International Monetary Fund revised its forecast for China\\\\\\'s economic growth due to expectations of continued policy support, according to the latest IMF World Economic Outlook report released on Jan 16.

Pollution-heavy industries, energy and mining-related businesses that damage the environment or those affected by the fluctuation of global commodity prices will be either prohibited or strictly monitored by regulators. Beijing gears up for green Winter Olympics President Xi Jinping pledged on Jan 18 to host an extraordinary Winter Olympic Games in 2022. While meeting with Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, at the committee\\\\\\'s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, Xi said Beijing will host a green, open-minded and corruption-free Olympic event. Gearing up for the 2022 Winter Games shows China\\\\\\'s support and proactive participation in the sporting event, the president said. Preparatory work will be a major task for China over the next few years, he added. Li calls sound jobs the key to momentum China will maintain a proactive policy on employment by providing diversified skills training, encouraging entrepreneurship and restructuring inefficient industries with the aim of boosting the number of new jobs and overall workforce quality. Unleashing market potential and enhancing policy implementation will be major priorities under a new program on employment for the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) period. The program was approved on Jan 18 at a State Council executive meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang. Swift measures to aid development Premier Li Keqiang has called on officials to respond quickly and actively to public concerns in order to manage market expectations. Speaking at a State Council plenary meeting on Jan 18, the premier urged more than 30 ministers and local governments to take timely action in the face of changing economic indicators, which should be closely tracked and analyzed to assist in policy-making. Facing increasing uncertainty about the global economy, as well as domestic challenges, the government must enhance its sense of urgency and maintain strategic determination to overcome difficulties, Li said. China \\\\\\'attractive\\\\\\' to US companies China remains a \"highly attractive\" destination for companies from the United States, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Jan 18, refuting a survey report published on the same day by a US business organization. In the 2017 China Business Climate Survey Report, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said that more than 80 percent of its 462 member companies surveyed \"feel foreign businesses are less welcome in China than before\". More than 60 percent expressed a lack of confidence in the Chinese government\\\\\\'s commitment to further opening China\\\\\\'s markets. In response, Hua quoted statistics issued by the Ministry of Commerce, showing that the US\\\\\\' actual investment in China witnessed a year-on-year increase of 52.6 percent in 2016. PLA slashes commercial activities The People\\\\\\'s Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force have halted 40 percent of their commercial activities as part of ongoing military reforms, Xinhua News Agency reported. Decommercialization efforts will now focus on five fields - housing rental, agricultural and livestock production, hospitality services, medical services and research and development - the report said on Jan 17. Governments in provincial-level regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and Guangdong, have set up interdepartmental teams to work with military authorities to push forward the efforts, it said, adding that most business owners who rented houses from or used commercial services of the military received local government assistance. Policies to support private schools Education authorities will support the development of private schools by issuing a series of preferential policies in areas including finance, taxes and land, the Ministry of Education announced on Jan 18. Private schools in China are either nonprofit and for-profit, and the support offered to the two types of school may differ, according to the ministry. For example, nonprofit private schools will be able to use land allocated by the government, just as public schools are, while their for-profit counterparts will not. But for-profit private schools will be able to set their own tuition fees. First quantum satellite surpasses expectations Micius, the world\\\\\\'s first quantum satellite, has successfully completed four months of in-orbit tests since China launched it on Aug 16, the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced. \"The overall performance has been much better than we expected, which will allow us to conduct all our planned experiments using the satellite ahead of schedule and even add some extra ones,\" said Pan Jianwei, chief scientist for the satellite project, on Jan 18. Country to clean up rural pollution China plans to rid its rural areas of pollution from wastewater and remove refuse from its mountains by 2020, officials said. Special campaigns have been launched in different regions to improve the rural environment, Zhao Hui, chief economic engineer of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, told a conference organized by the State Council Information Office on Jan 18. China didn\\\\\\'t have the ability to dispose of all newly-produced garbage before 2012, so garbage from urban areas piled up in rural areas, resulting in mountains of trash, Zhao said. 28m received legal aid over 4 years China has handled more than 5 million legal assistance cases since 2013, providing legal advice to more than 28 million people, the Ministry of Justice said on Jan 15.

This surge of interest comes at a time when the importance of infrastructure investment is increasingly obvious, despite sluggish global growth curtailing spending in advanced economies. \"It\\\\\\'s talked about so much. Businesses internationally knew about the Belt and Road Initiative but they don\\\\\\'t know how to get involved, so now discussions are focused on the details,\" says Honson To, chairman of KPMG China.   - People welcome President Xi Jinping to Davos on Jan 15. Xu Jingxing / China Daily  \"A key part of how China has developed in the last 30 years has been laying out infrastructure within the country. It\\\\\\'s a proven way. Now this concept will be exported to countries around the world with the Belt and Road Initiative,\" says To. Launched by President Xi Jinping three years ago, the initiative is now gaining momentum after receiving support from more than 100 countries and international organizations, more than 40 of which have signed cooperation agreements with China. In May this year, China will host the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, which will \"discuss ways to boost cooperation, build cooperation platforms and share cooperation outcomes\", as President Xi highlighted in his keynote address at Davos. Summit participants welcomed the high importance Xi attached to the Belt and Road Initiative, saying it was a concrete demonstration of China\\\\\\'s leadership in globalization and inclusive growth.    Thomas Maier, managing director for infrastructure at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says China can play a leadership role in supporting sustainable infrastructure development that is also environmentally friendly. It can also contribute to the development of a global system where the government leads infrastructure investment and encourage private sector investors to follow suit. Those values which EBRD champions are also coherent with the philosophy of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which pledges to operate with a \"lean, clean and green\" model, meaning long-term, sustainable infrastructure will get priority for funding. In June 2016 AIIB and EBRD agreed to jointly commit a total of $55 million to upgrade a key section of the motorway connecting Tajikistan with Uzbekistan, which is also one of AIIB\\\\\\'s first projects. Maier says another crucial way China contributes to the global infrastructure system is through funding provided by its large commercial banks. He also applauds Chinese companies\\\\\\' export of important environmentally friendly infrastructure and technology to countries along the Belt and Road. So far Chinese companies have invested more than $50 billion in projects in those countries. Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, former United Nations deputy secretary-general, says that the AIIB\\\\\\'s ability to deploy capital, especially from the private sector, is impressive and an inspiration for the way multinational development banks could function. \"AIIB\\\\\\'s capital commitment is able to attract private sector money because its agenda is closely aligned with the Chinese government\\\\\\'s emphasis on China becoming an important trading nation,\" says Malloch-Brown, who is also chairman of the non-profit group the Business and Sustainable Development Commission.

In his latest movie, he drives a car carrying a lion in the back seat, and the big cat is not computer-generated. The very real predator is owned by Dubai\\\\\\'s royal family. Chan plays an archeologist who seeks a lost treasure using an ancient map in the action-comedy Kung Fu Yoga. The movie, one of three Sino-Indian coproductions being made as a result of an agreement between the two countries, will be released on Jan 28, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year.   - The upcoming Sino-Indian coproduction Kung Fu Yoga features (clockwise from top left) Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan and Indian actress Disha Patani; veteran Indian actor Sonu Sood and Hong Kong actor and singer Aarif Lee. Photos Provided to China Daily  The film\\\\\\'s trailer, featuring the lion \"passenger\", which was released on Jan 5, has garnered millions of clicks on major video-streaming sites, making Kung Fu Yoga one of the most-anticipated films of the profitable Spring Festival holiday. Chan, who has starred in more than 100 films and been involved in at least another 100, is very popular globally for his unique blend of action and comedy. But this forthcoming title is more than just another Chan-style action comedy. In September 2014, China and India signed a groundbreaking agreement on coproducing films, in a bid to bring the two major movie powerhouses together. It yielded results in May the following year, when China\\\\\\'s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, and the Indian embassy in China announced plans for three joint productions. Kung Fu Yoga is one of the three films. The other two are a biographical feature, Xuan Zang, based on a seventh-century monk\\\\\\'s pilgrimage to India, and Buddies in India, comedian Wang Baoqiang\\\\\\'s directorial debut. Xuan Zang was released in April and Buddies in India will also premiere during the upcoming Spring Festival. Of the three films, Chan\\\\\\'s movie is expected to make an impression in India as the star\\\\\\'s early Hollywood blockbusters - Rumble in the Bronx (1995) and Rush Hour (1998) - made him a well-known name in the country. Also, Chan\\\\\\'s profile in India was boosted when his 2005 fantasy epic The Myth was filmed there. Disha Patani, an Indian actress in the film, says: \"In India, most young people have grown up watching Chan\\\\\\'s action movies. He is very famous in India. For me, it\\\\\\'s like a dream come true to work with him.\" The popularity of Chan\\\\\\'s action films means that many Indians believe most Chinese can perform martial-arts stunts like the actor, says Amyra Dastur, an India model-actress who also has a role in the film. Both the actresses - Patani, who plays an Indian professor assisting Chan, and Dastur, who plays her sister - say that the film is their first Chinese-language movie. The movie also features veteran actor Sonu Sood, who has starred in more than 60 Bollywood productions. As for the commercial prospects of the film, Chinese filmmakers believe it will make a splash in both markets. \"Kung fu is a symbol of China, just like yoga is of India,\" says Stanley Tong, the Hong Kong director who helped make Chan famous in Hollywood. The new film sees them teaming up again after Rumble in the Bronx, Police Story 4: First Strike and CZ12. Speaking about the challenges faced in making the movie, Tong says: \"It is a bit difficult to mix two cultures. I read a lot of ancient books, especially on cultural communication in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), which inspired me.\"    Giving details on the other aspects of the movie, Tong says the film features scenes shot in Iceland and Dubai. Most of Chan\\\\\\'s action films offer visual feasts. \"My job was to make this (action film) more creative and different.\" Also, using his personal connections with Dubai\\\\\\'s royal family, Tong borrowed several animals, including the lion, from them, besides some very expensive sports cars. For Chan, however, the movie is all in a day\\\\\\'s work. \"I love to be on a film set. It\\\\\\'s my amusement park. I always have new ideas and realize my dreams when I am there,\" the 62-year-old says. On set, Chan is said to always lead by example, whether doing stunts, choreography or just being environmentally aware. Seeing Chan picking up discarded bottles and using paper towels sparingly on set was an eye-opener for the two Indian actresses. Meanwhile, Jonathan Shen, founder of Shinework Media, one of the film\\\\\\'s Chinese producers, says the movie will enhance links between Chinese and Indian filmmakers. He says that the film will be released in around 500 cinemas in India. xufan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page1)\\'\\n \\'link Wednesday, October 26, 2016 Today, the amazingly energetic Donald J.

In 30 years, she\\\\\\'s done NOTHING for no one except herself, Chelsea, and Saudi Arabian women abusers. -CareWeMust\\'\\n \"Since Jan 17 media attention has been monopolized by the annual World Economic Forum, which brings together leaders in politics, business, economics, technology and society. This year the main topic discussed was how to promote responsible and responsive leadership. As shown by recent voting, the gap between political leaders and civil society has never been as important as it is today. Digital media are providing key instruments for reducing the gap. Politicians and business leaders have embraced Twitter in order to stay in touch with their constituents, turning them into followers. But Twitter is only the tip of an iceberg. Social media, connected devices and big data will provide a better match between the expectations of voters and customers on one side and those of political and business leaders on the other. A few weeks ago, the Las Vegas\\' Consumer Electronics Show (CES) once again offered a showcase for new digital opportunities in this area. Leading telecom vendor ZTE presented its new \\'Hawkeye\\' smartphone, which resulted from its innovative crowdsourcing project to develop a phone based on consumer choices. Last year, ZTE started collecting ideas from the Android community about the future smartphone they would like to see on the market. Future users chose from phones with five core features, such as eye-tracking, self-adhesive back, waterproof VR mask functions, and the ZTE is now in mass production thanks to the success of crowd-sourcing. Empowerment of the consumer is the future. In the same vein, WeChat, the messaging service of Chinese tech giant Tencent, is taking a big step to liberate smartphone users from the need to compare and download apps from Google Play or the App Store. The main features normally obtained via apps are now available inside the messaging service via so-called mini-programs, allowing users to make payments, book a taxi, order food, book tickets, etc. The days of apps may be numbered. It isn\\'t just luck that these major innovations came from China. A total of 1,575 Chinese companies exhibited in Las Vegas, one third of the total number of exhibitors, second only to the US. These numbers illustrate the increased contributions of China to the global economy, not only in terms of innovation but also as an engine of economic growth. Today, China is progressively translating this economic power into political influence. This was highlighted by media coverage of the keynote speech given by President Xi Jinping on Jan 17, due not only to the fact that it was the first appearance of a Chinese head of state at Davos, but mainly because of his clear messages. In his strong defense of globalization, President Xi claimed that the only way to ensure growth and productivity is to work hand-in-hand to improve global governance and make it more inclusive. The president confirmed his country\\'s firm commitment to pursuing an enabling environment for foreign investments, boosting domestic consumption, developing advanced manufacturing and striving to maintain the positive momentum of the Chinese economy, which has contributed as much as 30 percent to annual global growth since the financial crisis. Xi\\'s message will have been music to the ears of the large delegation from the EU - 12 commissioners out of 28 - in Davos. With the French and German elections in sight, a major challenge for the Eurozone is to deliver growth. Forecasts see growth in the Eurozone slowing slightly in 2017, after coming in at an expected 1.6 percent in 2016. Forecasts for 2018 are not much better: GDP growth is predicted to stagnate at 1.5 percent in 2018. At the same time, the Chinese economy is expected to grow at 6.5 percent in 2017. EU leaders are looking east, particularly now that the incoming Trump administration is bringing substantial uncertainties about future EU-US and US-China trade relations. The EU has much to offer China. First, there is a stable and predictable trade policy framework determined by the EU Commission under the active leadership of Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who attended the Davos Forum, explaining the opportunities offered by the EU\\'s trade policy to the top Chinese business leaders who were present. These included Alibaba\\'s Chairman Jack Ma, China Telecom\\'s Chairman Yang Jie, Baidu\\'s Chairman Zhang Yaqin and HTC\\'s Chairwoman Cher Wang. Second, there are lucrative investment opportunities. Think of the recent acquisition of German robotics maker Kuka by China\\'s Midea. The EU\\'s innovative companies allow China to fill technology gaps and strengthen its emerging global digital leadership. On the initiative of Jyrki Katainen, European Commission vice-president for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, the EU has launched a practical operational website allowing any company in the world to find investment projects in the EU, including its digital sector - the European Investment Project Portal - with, for the moment, a list of 139 promising projects. President Xi made clear that isolationism is not part of his country\\'s policy. Let us now work together to implement this policy, bring together Chinese and EU business and start building together our common future.

(China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page7)\"\\n \"President Xi Jinping calls for open and inclusive growth in the World Economic Forum The world is now at a crucial juncture, facing either progress with globalization or retreat into protectionism, and Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s call for open and inclusive growth in Davos this week came like a breath of fresh air, injecting new confidence into global economic relations. One can really feel the power of his messages in Davos, where his words remained a hot talking point throughout the week of the forum. President Xi spoke about market-driven growth, free trade, environmental sustainability and fostering win-win partnerships globally. With those messages, China is stepping into its newfound role as a global leader, filling in a vacuum once occupied by the US. Despite leading the world\\'s largest economy, President Donald Trump and his administration have shown protectionist tendencies, driven by voters who feel left out of the benefits of globalization. Under this context, President Xi\\'s advocacy for free trade became more important, and is yet another reflection of the Chinese ancient philosophy of mutual benefit and win-win partnerships, which have shaped the country\\'s way of thinking for thousands of years. Philosophy aside, China\\'s development is itself an apt reflection of the benefits of globalization. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it felt worried that multinationals\\' entrance into China would lead to severe unemployment. But this fear was soon appeased, as many Chinese firms became more vibrant and competitive due to globalization. Industries with few trade barriers, like technology, benefited the most from globalization, while those receiving government protection still experienced great inefficiencies, such as the energy sector. Over the years, China has not only benefited from globalization but also contributed to other countries\\' wealth and prosperity. As China\\'s manufacturing sector grew and it became the world\\'s factory, consumers in Western countries enjoyed more wealth and consumption. More importantly, manufacturing jobs\\' shift to China freed up the labor market in advanced economies like the US, allowing them to focus more on high-end services for which profit margins are much higher. Meanwhile, China\\'s economic growth has created an expanding middle class whose consumption power is now having a huge influence on the world. Consider the record number of Chinese tourists and students going abroad to advanced economies like the US, allowing them to export products without physically shipping them overseas. But the story does not end here, because globalization is not just about trade, it is also the exchange of ideas and building of platforms. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg visited China\\'s technology giant Tencent for learning and inspiration, Tencent welcomed him with open doors. Many Chinese firms expanding overseas are bringing Western businesses into their existing ecosystems, helping them to access the Chinese market. E-commerce giant Alibaba is now helping many US brands to sell to Chinese buyers through its cost-effective e-commerce logistics channels. Through this integration of ideas, channels and platforms in our increasingly connected global economy, Chinese businesses are becoming more globally-oriented and creating jobs in international markets. Just this month, Alibaba\\'s founder Jack Ma promised one million jobs to the US when he met with President Trump. Home appliance manufacturer Hisense, which has built a factory in Mexico, now conducts much of its research and development in international markets. Chinese firms are becoming increasingly global, and Chinese business leaders\\' presence at Davos is rapidly expanding. China is the focus of discussions across a diverse range of sessions at the forum. Chinese CEOs are increasingly confident and articulate. Dalian Wanda\\'s founder Wang Jianlin grabbed media headlines when he urged the US to keep its market open and refrain from protectionist tendencies. China\\'s business leaders, like Wang, are becoming increasingly unafraid to voice their views. As the world is trying to get back on its feet and find new sources of growth and new directions for development, China\\'s advocacy for globalization seems to have offered a version of a solution. But China also needs to realize that actions speak louder than words, and the world is watching to see how China translates President Xi\\'s commitments into concrete policies. China needs to strengthen its credibility by further opening up its borders to international trade and investment partners, according to the president\\'s promise, and perhaps inspire other global leaders to follow its lead in building a more inclusive world.

This list shows a set of data which specify China\\'s contribution to the global economy:                 (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page9)\"\\n \\'Trump\\\\\\'s hostile language and protectionist promises could condemn his nation to miss out on trade opportunities Many like to borrow military expressions in describing business competition, a hot one being \"trade war\". Some say Donald Trump, the new US president, may think himself a contemporary General Patton, a warrior in trade. And the anticipated trade war would be Trump\\\\\\'s main theater. In response, some Chinese commentators recommend their readers go back to the nation\\\\\\'s 2,000-year-old Art of War by Sun Tzu to find defense methods. The fact is - and it is an important fact - that seeing trade in terms of war has never been a smart thing to do. Business is not a war. The biggest difference between business competition and a war is the simple fact that all wars end. No matter how bad a war is, there is a day when one side prevails, and peace is restructured.    But in business, competition goes on. Its logic doesn\\\\\\'t recognize an \"end\" so long as a company doesn\\\\\\'t break up by itself. In the long run, there is no specific enemy. The more a company grows, the more it will find competition a market-wide challenge, joined by rivals large and small, known and unknown. Nor can it be possible for any triumph, however celebrated, to result in a monopoly as clear and solid as the status of a superpower in the geopolitical sense. This is why the victory of Apple\\\\\\'s iPhone over Nokia was not a victory for the whole market. It still faces competition from many other players in the market, and any small mistake may cost its market share in the world. As for trade war, there is only one way in which it can make sense. That is when it is used no more than a trade embargo - to serve not a business purpose, but a political purpose. Even when trade is being used for a political purpose, the user will have to take a few precautions to control the possible damage on its own economic goals, making sure the target is a weaker and less productive economy, that the policy has worldwide support, and that the goods affected by the policy will be high in strategic importance but limited in number. This being the case, the grand trade war that Trump and his lieutenants may be planning is a rather unconventional one. It will be used to serve not a specific political purpose, but an economic agenda which, paradoxically, is touted as \"making America great again\".    If the incoming administration does what it has declared, it will wage a trade war on all imported goods from China, if not from the rest of the world. That would certainly be unprecedented in history. But will it work? It won\\\\\\'t. Apart from its enormous size and complex, often multilateral details, there are two things on the macro-economic level to challenge the very logic of a trade war. First, global market will continue to develop even if the United States no longer wants to play a leading part in it. The size of world trade is nowadays more than eight times that of 1980, before president Ronald Reagan took office. In Reagan\\\\\\'s time, the biggest trade challenge to the US was presented by Japan. Now, China and many other developing countries with a general wage level much lower than that of Japan, can produce things almost as well as American workers. There are millions of such workers throughout Southeast Asia and India. Their manufacturing capabilities are attested by the fact that trade among developing countries has now grown larger than trade between developed and developing countries in value, and is close in size to the trade among all developed countries. In recent years, China\\\\\\'s trade with ASEAN countries has been on a more rapid increase than its trade with the US. Developing countries can continue to trade with one another and are likely to yield more shared opportunities despite the one-sided trade war waged by the US. Second, assuming the so-called Trumponomics works and 25 million new jobs are created within a few years in a protected environment, the US will still have to rely on the international market to sell the new workers\\\\\\' products, which can\\\\\\'t all be consumed at home. Unless Trump is determined to permanently shut the US down to the world market to follow a path of Stalinist self-sufficiency, his administration will still have to seek mutually-beneficial trade policies with foreign countries, especially with Asia, where the world\\\\\\'s largest group of new middle-class consumers is. Chinese President Xi Jinping told his audience in Davos, Switzerland, that in the coming five years, China\\\\\\'s development is expected to generate a demand for $8 trillion of imports, $600 billion of inbound investments and $750 billion of outbound investments. Those waging of a trade war with China can\\\\\\'t afford to miss out on these rich opportunities. The author is editor-at-large of China Daily.

For the first time ever, the World Economic Forum was attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who gave a keynote address vigorously defending free trade. It was applauded by political and business leaders as a rich symbol of China taking the lead in global issues, reflecting this year\\\\\\'s forum theme of \"responsive and responsible leadership\".    \"There is no point in blaming economic globalization for the world\\\\\\'s problems because that is simply not the case,\" Xi said on Jan 17. The four-day forum ended on Jan 20 and was attended by 3,000 delegates. Offering his suggestions for new sources of growth, Xi stressed the need to develop a dynamic innovation-driven growth model, which leads to win-win cooperation, fair and equitable governance and balanced, equitable and inclusive development. Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, praises Xi\\\\\\'s address, saying his commitment is crucial \"to the innovative, open and inclusive world.\" \"We\\\\\\'re living in a global, interdependent world and we cannot recreate artificial borders. Globalization is a win-win situation and we have a common destiny as humankind,\" Schwab says. He acknowledges the \"Chinese Dream\" initiated by Xi while calling for a \"Global Dream\", a dream of a world that remains innovative, open and fair. The World Economic Forum in Davos, founded 47 years ago, has made a name for itself as both a gathering for global elites and an incubator of new ideas, but this year China\\\\\\'s strong participation made it special. \"Xi\\\\\\'s remarks come at a critical juncture in history,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou, head of research at the think tank Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. \"The US and the UK, once the champions of economic liberalism and the proponents of globalization, are retreating from the world stage and from integration with their neighbors. In this context, Xi\\\\\\'s speech was a refreshing showcase of his leadership on the world stage,\" Kyriakopoulou says.    Xi\\\\\\'s speech comes at a time when sluggish economic growth in the West has led to signs of protectionist measures. Populist leaders have been taking advantage of the dissatisfaction of those left behind by globalization. US President Donald Trump, who did not attend the forum due to his inauguration, pledged during his election campaign to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. Meanwhile, the UK is experiencing Brexit-related uncertainties after the British public voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum. Aside from Xi\\\\\\'s address, China\\\\\\'s representation at Davos this year is unprecedented. Insightful sessions by Chinese entrepreneurs like Dalian Wanda\\\\\\'s Wang Jianlin and Alibaba\\\\\\'s Jack Ma have been hugely popular. The interest is easy to understand, especially considering Alibaba made history as the largest Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. Dalian Wanda made headlines in 2016 with the $3.5 billion (3.2 billion euros; 2.8 billion) purchase of production house Legendary Entertainment, becoming the first Chinese company to own a major American film company. Chinese firms are shaping and shaking the world economy, but so are many China-initiated trends and concepts. China\\\\\\'s Belt and Road Initiative, China\\\\\\'s outward direct investment, Chinese firms\\\\\\' globalization and China\\\\\\'s middle-class consumers are hot topics repeatedly featured at panel discussions this year. Perhaps China is now inseparable from the global economy. \"China advances on all fronts and no longer hesitates to propose its own models, its own values,\" says Andre Loesekrug-Pietri, founder and managing partner of ACapital, a private equity fund. Three years after Xi proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to increase Europe and Asia\\\\\\'s trade and investment relationships through improved infrastructure, it has received support from more than 100 countries and international organizations. More than 40 countries and international organizations have signed cooperation agreements with China, and Chinese companies have made more than $50 billion of investment, spurring the economic development of these countries and creating many local jobs. The China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is introducing a new model for multinational development banks. \"What\\\\\\'s striking about the AIIB is its ability to deploy lots of capital, especially by pulling capital from the private sector. In scale and ambition, many older generation multinational development banks can learn from it,\" says Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, former United Nations deputy secretary-general. As China increasingly plays an important economic role internationally, the country is also opening up and liberalizing its domestic market - a comment Xi reiterated at Davos. In 2016, the Chinese government significantly increased foreign access to its domestic bond and stock markets. The internationalization of the renminbi, marked by its inclusion in the International Monetary Fund\\\\\\'s basket of special drawing rights currencies, is seen as a great contribution to global financial stability. \"Increased usage of the renminbi in global trade transactions and as a reserve currency by central banks in a number of developed and developing economies will, in time, reduce vulnerability to bouts of US dollar strength,\" says Phyllis Papadavid, a senior research fellow of the Overseas Development Institute think tank. \"The renminbi\\\\\\'s inclusion in SDR and its growing internationalization is a reflection of China\\\\\\'s ongoing financial deepening and expansion. Chinese policymakers are likely to continue to set the conditions for further financial and economic liberalization,\" Papadavid says.    But China\\\\\\'s international leadership is not just reflected in economic issues, as Davos participants highlight. Helen Hai, a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, says China can take a leadership role in achieving sustainable development goals, especially by sharing with other developing countries its own lessons in industrialization and poverty reduction. \"I\\\\\\'m so glad to see such huge participation from China this year at Davos. China has made significant contributions in the Millennium Development Goals, it achieved the biggest poverty reduction globally and, going forward, China is going to tell the world how it has transformed itself,\" Hai says. Last year the Chinese government released plans aiming to lift all of China\\\\\\'s poor, by current standards, out of poverty by 2020, 10 years ahead of the schedule set by the UN sustainable development goals. To help other developing nations achieve their targets, China also pledged aid through the China-initiated assistance fund for South-South Cooperation and the China-UN Peace and Development Fund. Business leaders also warmly welcomed China\\\\\\'s continued commitment to the Paris climate accord on reducing carbon emissions. In September 2015, China announced its aim to hit peak CO2 emissions by around 2030 and slash emissions per unit of the GDP by 60-65 percent from the 2005 level. \"China\\\\\\'s voice (at Davos) is urgently needed,\" says Tom Szaky, CEO of TerraCycle, a US recycling technology firm, explaining Davos can help China develop important and timely alliances with businesses and non-government organizations on environmental issues. \"China is taking the lead in terms of investing in a more sustainable future through changes in energy, waste and other consumer patterns,\" Szaky says. Despite optimism over talk of growth at Davos, many challenges still exist for global growth in 2017, perhaps further highlighting the importance of China\\\\\\'s contribution. Papadavid of ODI says she sees continued sluggish growth in the global economy as heightened political uncertainty in the US, Europe and the UK could reduce investment intentions, while protracted weakness in commodities is likely to reduce trade growth, especially in emerging and developing countries. \"China\\\\\\'s economic transformation will be important. The emergent strength in China\\\\\\'s household sector is likely to provide a stimulus to global growth,\" Papadavid says. In his advocacy for globalization, Xi stressed that China has not only benefited from economic globalization but also contributed to it. He explained that rapid growth in China has been a sustained, powerful engine for global economic stability and expansion, while the inter-connected development of China with a large number of other countries has made the world economy more balanced. The numbers speak for themselves. In the coming five years, Xi said, China is expected to import $8 trillion-worth of goods, attract $600 billion of foreign investment and make $750 billion of outbound investment. Chinese tourists will make 700 million overseas visits. China\\\\\\'s contribution to global economic growth and its unprecedented participation at Davos have highlighted the country\\\\\\'s growing international leadership. \"There is a vacuum when it comes to global economic leadership and Xi Jinping is clearly aiming to fill it,\" says former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com   Â\\\\xa0 President Xi Jinping delivers the keynote speech at the World Economic Forum on Jan 17 in Davos, Switzerland.

HMD Global, which owns rights to use Nokia\\\\\\'s brand on mobile phones, recently announced its first smartphone, the Nokia 6, to target Chinese consumers. It will be released exclusively in China through internet retail giant JD.com early this year. The launch marks the first handset produced under the Nokia brand since 2014, when the company sold its devices and services division to Microsoft Corp. The new device will run on Google\\\\\\'s Android system with a 13.97-centimeter screen, and featuring 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Catering to the middle of the market, the handset is equipped with a Snapdragon 430 processor and is priced at 1,699 yuan ($245; 232 euros; 201). \"We intend to move with speed to establish a position as a player in the smartphone category,\" says Arto Nummela, chief executive officer of HMD Global. \"We look forward to unveiling further products in the first half of this year.\" The Finland-based company, which secured a license to produce Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets for the next decade, hopes to win back the lost glory of Nokia, which once dominated mobile phone sales but then failed to nail the smartphone market in the late 2000s. However, Xiang Ligang, independent analyst and founder of telecom industry website cctime.com, says it is difficult for new devices to rolling out in China. \"In terms of producing midrange cellphones, Nokia won\\\\\\'t be able to beat domestic brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo and Oppo,\" Xiang says.

He says exceptionally low interest rates and an excessive amount of capital in the insurance sector are driving down both investment returns and premiums for insurers. Nelson also notes the rapid development of technology, which has also increased competition in markets by changing the relationship between insurers and their customers.   - John Nelson, chairman of Lloyd\\\\\\'s of London. Getty Images  Lloyd\\\\\\'s of London, the world\\\\\\'s oldest market for specialty insurance and reinsurance, is responding with a strategy known as Vision 2025, according to Nelson. One of the highlights of the strategy is international expansion. Central to that is China, which will remain one of the most important frontiers for the institution as it continues to evolve from its start in a coffeehouse in London dealing in marine insurance in the 17th century to a global marketplace where more than 200 insurance brokers come to pool and spread risks. Nelson spoke recently with China Daily about the insurance market\\\\\\'s strategy and its plans in China. The following are edited excerpts from the interview: How do you see the growth potential of the Chinese insurance sector and what opportunities are there for Lloyd\\\\\\'s? Over the last few years China has become an extremely important platform for the Lloyd\\\\\\'s market. In Shanghai and in Beijing, we now have over half of the Lloyd\\\\\\'s managing agents physically present on the platform - 31 to be precise. We have increased our business substantially on this platform to 792 million yuan ($114 million; 107.7 million euros; 92 million) in gross written premiums in 2015, and we are confident we will surpass 2 billion for the past year. We continue to see China as perhaps the most important growth market in the long term for Lloyd\\\\\\'s. Insurance can provide vital support and protection, allowing Chinese companies to offset risks and focus on growing their businesses. In particular, Lloyd\\\\\\'s has the specialist expertise for the sorts of large construction, energy, marine and transport projects that this country is investing in. As a platform for international expansion, Lloyd\\\\\\'s provides a really good springboard for Chinese insurers wanting to develop their international strategies. For example, China Reinsurance Group has joined the Lloyd\\\\\\'s platform. We also signed a memorandum of understanding with China Taiping Reinsurance in October. I think these things take time and that global carriers from China coming onto the Lloyd\\\\\\'s platform will increase. How do you plan to further expand your presence in China? Our Shanghai hub opened in 2007, and two years ago we opened a branch in Beijing, which brought us closer to the major reinsurance market. We have about nine managing agents on that platform and I am very pleased with the progress. I think the main next step is to reinforce what we have already done. We\\\\\\'ve got the core of the market here. Now the challenge for the participants is to increase penetration in specialist lines. We are looking at new forms of distribution and are trying to get these specialist lines more into the veins and arteries of the Chinese economy. How can Lloyd\\\\\\'s specialties and services meet the need for more sophisticated insurance products amid China\\\\\\'s ongoing process of urbanization? Increasing urbanization is in one sense making the economy more efficient and more interconnected. But in another sense, it is concentrating risks, and the consequences are obviously more relevant if you have greater urbanization. China is a classic example of a country that continues to rapidly urbanize. The movement of people from the countryside to the cities is making economies more efficient, but also making them more vulnerable to systemic shock. What we are seeing is that the risk from natural catastrophes is increasing, but also man-made risks such as cyberattacks. What role can Lloyd\\\\\\'s play in China\\\\\\'s Belt and Road Initiative? The initiative will deepen trade ties between China and Europe and secure the future prosperity of generations to come in areas of the developing world. And it has the power to reshape the economic landscape, just as the original Silk Road did before it. It will also provide new development opportunities for Chinese insurers\\\\\\' international operations as well as global reinsurers, with them providing capacity and global expertise.    And just as Lloyd\\\\\\'s was the backstop behind early maritime trade and the transport innovations that subsequently transformed our world, so we are ready to partner with Chinese insurers to provide solutions to support and protect China\\\\\\'s economic growth and Chinese business interests abroad. How do you intend to attract more capital from Chinese insurers to Lloyd\\\\\\'s platform after forming partnerships with two of China\\\\\\'s reinsurance firms? I think over the next five to 10 years, you will see a number of additional Chinese carriers coming onto the platform. We want the process to be gradual and don\\\\\\'t want see people rushing at making a commitment. There is no point for the Lloyd\\\\\\'s market in a carrier coming on just for capital. What we want is to make sure it is broadening our footprint and business. We are also very keen to diversify the nationality base of the people on the Lloyd\\\\\\'s platform. So if a carrier wants to come on to the Lloyd\\\\\\'s platform, we are very keen that they put some of their best people into their Lloyd\\\\\\'s business. We think that having Chinese people on the Lloyd\\\\\\'s platform will massively increase the expertise in the market. China has established an insurance exchange in Shanghai with the ambition to develop its own insurance market. What does this mean for Lloyd\\\\\\'s? This is where I think Lloyd\\\\\\'s can help. We can bring expertise to the new products and we can do that through reinsurance and by backing up domestic insurers. Also, diversifying reinsurance risks outside the country can help the domestic economy. So in other words, having a liberal insurance market is very important. The Shanghai Insurance Exchange is in its early days. We are supportive of it and we have agreed to become a member of it. It will be very interesting to see how it develops. What is the biggest challenge for Lloyd\\\\\\'s to navigate in the Chinese insurance market? I think one of the biggest challenges is assessing risks in China. As the economy changes, there is a lack of data and a lack of history. In other countries, we have got good quality data which allow us to model risks more accurately. As time goes on, that will improve in China. But at the moment it is still somewhat difficult as it is at a fairly early stage of development. As times passes, we will be able to collect the data and it will become easier for us to model the risk. How would you define your management philosophy at Lloyd\\\\\\'s? If you look at it as a soccer analogy, we set out the football pitch, we mow the grass, we paint the lines and we make it as good a pitch as it could possibly be. That is our philosophy. What do you do in your free time? I enjoy my family. And I enjoy sailing. I have been sailing since I was 15.

Motor neurone disease had left him a shadow of the gladiator who helped the Springboks win the World Cup in 1995, but his contribution to the game will never be forgotten, says former teammate Cobus Visagie. \"Joost basically created the new requirements for a modern No. 9,\" the former South Africa front-row prop told CNN\\\\\\'s World Sport show Tuesday. Van der Westhuizen was 6 foot 2 inches tall, but played at scrumhalf -- a position traditionally occupied by the game\\\\\\'s smallest players, providing the link between teams\\\\\\' backs and forwards. \"Some days I looked down when we were standing in a circle and saw a man with boots three sizes bigger than myself -- a scrumhalf!\" added Visagie, who played alongside van der Westhuizen at the 1999 World Cup and won 29 caps for his country. \"He had incredible speed, he had incredible bravery -- he\\\\\\'s very well known for the tackles he made in the crucial 1995 World Cup, but also in all other games.\" In the 1995 World Cup final against New Zealand, van der Westhuizen stopped a rampaging Jonah Lomu when the giant winger had broken through the South African defense. The Springboks went on to win 15-12 in extra time, in the first major sporting event to be staged in South Africa after the end of Apartheid rule. The \\\\\\'95 side has achieved iconic status, notably through the Hollywood film \"Invictus.\" \"Who could forget that \\\\\\'95 World Cup tackle?\" former Springboks forward Alistair Hargreaves told CNN. \"He was fearless, and for a scrumhalf he certainly broke the mold. As a young boy, he epitomized what South African rugby was all about. We idolized him.\" READ: Blitzboks star leaves sevens on a high READ: Scotland stuns Ireland in Six Nations opener READ: Van der Westhuizen vows to fight motor neurone disease Courage on the field -- and off it Van der Westhuizen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011, having retired from international rugby in 2003 with what was then a record 89 caps for the Springboks. Also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig\\\\\\'s disease, the condition causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time. In 2014 the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" became a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people helping to raise awareness and funds to research the disease. Although he never played alongside van der Westhuizen, Hargreaves -- who left South Africa in 2012 to play domestic rugby in England -- was fortunate enough to met his childhood hero later in life. \"I met him after his career and I probably met him at a time that his illness really kicked in,\" Hargreaves said. \"If he was resilient on the field, he certainly proved to be resilient and even more courageous when he found out about the terrible circumstances he found himself in. \"What a brilliant battle he fought. You can only respect the man for what he did.\" After his diagnosis, van der Westhuizen set up the J9 Foundation, a charity dedicated to helping sufferers of motor neurone disease. \"It is incredibly sad, but Joost fought a long battle,\" Hargreaves added. \"He was aware of the struggle he faced and I presume there is a certain amount of relief at the end of it. \"The guy has achieved so much, he\\\\\\'s done so much for rugby, I\\\\\\'m sure they\\\\\\'re going to hold him up as a real legend of the game.\" Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos A public memorial service will be held on Friday at Loftus Versveld Stadium in Pretoria, South Africa, the home ground of van der Westhuizen\\\\\\'s provincial side the Blue Bulls.\\'\\n \\'Government procurement contracts to be open to bids by overseas companies if the products they offer are locally made China will lure more foreign direct investment by allowing international companies to bid on government procurement contracts - as long as their products are made in China, according to Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen. At a news conference in Beijing on Jan 6, Wang said the government had noticed that China\\\\\\'s ability to attract foreign direct investment has been challenged in recent years by a number of factors, including the cost advantages of domestic production. Additionally, nearby countries have been taking their own steps to entice more foreign investment to their shores.    \"Some neighboring countries have already begun to offer more favorable policies to gain FDI to compete with China,\" he said. \"Many developed countries are also encouraging their manufacturing businesses to move back to their home markets to boost jobs and taxes.\" Wang\\\\\\'s comments follow the State Council\\\\\\'s approval of a document last month that aims to make the process for FDI more direct, fair, open and efficient. The document outlined the steps required to give foreign capital more market access to the country\\\\\\'s services sector - including reviews of account auditing, financial institutions, share brokerages, fund management, telecommunications, internet, culture and education. The opening of opportunities in rail transportation, one of China\\\\\\'s pillar manufacturing sectors, is also included to stimulate market competition. Wang said international companies can still remit their revenues overseas or add new investments anytime. He said China\\\\\\'s recent moves to tighten controls on capital outflows was targeting only illegal activities and was temporary. Profits earned by international groups based on the Chinese mainland - as well as companies from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in the manufacturing sector - grew by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 1.5 trillion yuan ($216.8 billion; 205 billion euros; 175.4 billion) between January and November 2016. Li Guo, vice-minister of the General Administration of Customs, says the customs service will further simplify port clearance procedures; and it will also encourage more innovation in trade processing and more special customs-control areas to support both China\\\\\\'s FDI and foreign trade activities. Li says the central government is allowing local governments to set their own policies to attract FDI within their statutory powers, based on their own economic development characteristics. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page29)\\'\\n \\'Expert says Chinese companies in UK that allow local autonomy tend to be most successful The fastest-growing Chinese-owned companies in the United Kingdom come in all shapes and sizes - although a look at the executives reveals that they do share some things in common. Boards are typically gender diverse, younger and willing to work alongside local management to enhance innovation, according to the authors of a new report released by accountancy firm Grant Thornton. The Grant Thornton Tou Ying Tracker 2016, produced in collaboration with China Daily, is a compilation of the 30 fastest-growing Chinese-owned firms in the UK. At Chinese state-owned enterprises on the list, 12 percent of board members in the UK are female. The boards of private Chinese-owned companies in Britain are 6 percent female. Both levels compare favorably with the 5.6 percent of board positions occupied by women at companies listed in the FTSE 250 Index. Three companies in particular stand out for their gender diversity. Four of 13 board members at ICBC Standard Bank are women; two women sit on telecom giant Huawei\\\\\\'s seven-strong board; and Bank of China subsidiary China Bridge Group has an all-female board.  The board members at fast-growing Chinese-owned companies in the UK are also younger on average than their British counterparts. In the UK, the average age of nonexecutive directors is 59; for executives it\\\\\\'s 52. The average age of board members across the companies on the Grant Thornton list is 48. In terms of management strategy, Simon Bevan, head of the China Britain Services Group at Grant Thornton and co-author of the report, says the Chinese companies that give more autonomy to their UK entities during and after mergers or acquisitions tend to be more successful than those that govern more rigidly from afar. \"Those companies that have devolved power in order to ensure that the acquisition is well integrated are, in my experience, more successful than those that make an acquisition from China and try to run it from China,\" Bevan says. \"The ability of the people on the ground to make real-time decisions and to be more dynamic is a big factor in ensuring integration.\" Bevan points to Fosun\\\\\\'s 2015 takeover of nursery product brand Silver Cross as an example of a successful acquisition in which a Chinese company worked alongside an existing UK management team with limited interference. Eight of the 14 private companies on the 2016 list are products of the M&A process, and such deals can be expected to continue in 2017 as more Chinese companies look to go global, says Angus Knowles-Cutler, China Services Group Chairman for Deloitte. \"I think there will be even more focused M&A activity from China in Europe in 2017 - and quite a lot of it. And it\\\\\\'s going to be increasingly professional,\" Knowles-Cutler says. \"I\\\\\\'ve seen in the past year or two Chinese businesses becoming much more professional with their merger and acquisition activity in Europe. They are taking due diligence more seriously; they are increasingly making sure what they buy is a good strategic fit.\" Bevan, however, encourages Chinese companies in the UK to adhere more closely to administrative regulations, particularly as the market becomes more competitive and the Chinese presence in the UK becomes more established. \"One particularly striking thing was the high proportion of late filed accounts,\" Bevan says of the Chinese companies researched by Grant Thornton. \"Out of 280 companies, 30 percent were late in filing. It\\\\\\'s not the most important aspect of governance, but it\\\\\\'s a quantitative aspect that you can say points to the fact that there is not as strong a focus on good governance as is the ideal.\" angus@mail.chinadailyuk.com   ( China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page30)\\'\\n \\'Alibaba boss pledges to add US companies to its huge lineup of e-commerce sites Alibaba\\\\\\'s ambitious plan to create 1 million US jobs has highlighted the importance of the Chinese market to the incoming Trump administration while boosting the win-win economic relationship between China and the United States, analysts say.

Drew Angerer / Getty Images  Ma, who oversees the world\\\\\\'s largest online shopping sites, says the two shared \"ideas about how we can improve trade\". After the meeting at Trump Tower in New York, Trump told reporters: \"Jack and I are going to do some great things.\" \"We had a great meeting,\" Trump said. He called Ma \"a great, great entrepreneur, one of the best in the world, and he loves this country, and he loves China\". Ma says he thinks Trump is \"very smart\" and \"very open-minded\". Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, says the meeting was a sign that the incoming Trump administration is optimistic that China\\\\\\'s burgeoning middle class will continue to consume more foreign products. China exports consumer goods in exchange for high-tech, energy, agricultural and automobile products from the United States, Sang says, adding that \"most of the trade is complementary. It isn\\\\\\'t direct competition.\" Li Gang, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, says small and medium-sized businesses in the US are keen to ship their products to China however they can, including e-commerce. \"Giant companies such as Boeing, Honeywell International or Johnson Controls will also push their government to build healthy business ties with China to compete with their European and Japanese rivals,\" Li adds. Bilateral trade between two countries totaled 3.08 trillion yuan ($445 billion; 421.9 billion euros; 365.7 billion) between January and November, dropping by 1.7 percent year-on-year, according to the General Administration of Customs. Over the next five years, the consumption demand of China\\\\\\'s domestic market will reach $10 trillion, the Ministry of Commerce forecast. That will present attractive trade and investment opportunities to global companies. The meeting with Trump is a good demonstration of Ma\\\\\\'s earlier call to use the internet to knock down trade barriers and provide small and medium-sized enterprises easier access in global commerce, says Qi Xiaozhai, head of the Shanghai Society of Commercial Economy. Alibaba already enables approximately 10 million merchants to sell to Chinese consumers, according to company data. It is considered to be responsible for creating more than 30 million jobs in China since 2003, when shopping portal Taobao was founded. The e-commerce empire envisages 40 percent of its business coming from outside China in the next decade, with a long-term goal of serving 2 billion customers globally and supporting 10 million profitable businesses. According to the 2016 Business Climate Survey conducted by AmCham China, 92 percent of respondents described bilateral relations between China and the US as positive and extremely important to their business growth in China. Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen says bilateral trade has provided huge sales revenues to manufacturers in both countries, adding that it is unlikely either party would do something to sabotage already stable business ties.

The move was designed to raise awareness of risks, as the value of bitcoin has experienced wild fluctuations. The value of each bitcoin jumped more than 14 percent on Jan 6, after hitting an all-time high of $1,180 (1,114 euros; 954) the previous day. The currency\\\\\\'s value fluctuated by more than 30 percent within the past two weeks. A statement by the People\\\\\\'s Bank of China Shanghai head office on Jan 6 called the changes in the virtual currency \"abnormal\", and said authorities are requiring the trading platform to operate in compliance with established standards. They urged the platform to probe investors\\\\\\' behavior and to rectify misbehavior. The statement said authorities would like to reaffirm that bitcoin is strictly a virtual currency that cannot be regarded as currency in circulation. Investors flocked to the bitcoin market in recent days in a bid to gain from its fast appreciation. It rose 200 percent in 2016, while analysts warned that wild fluctuations of the virtual currency\\\\\\'s price and lack of transparency of its flows may be risky. According to data of Shanghai-based BTCC, a bitcoin trading platform, more than 100 new investors started trading the virtual currency in the past three days, a fast growth compared to some 20 new investors before October in 2016. The bitcoin model limits the currency to a total of 21 million units, of which 16 million have already come into existence. The method to create new bitcoin involves complicated computer processes and has become increasingly difficult: On average no more than 7,000 new bitcoins are supplied to the market per year. \"This trend shows that the bitcoin market\\\\\\'s appeal has been rising to a new level,\" a market review by BTCC said on Jan 4.

Their demand for bitcoin will grow further, as I have observed,\" he says. Analysts warned that bitcoin is not a tool that guarantees yield - and especially for new investors who have limited knowledge about the history of the virtual currency\\\\\\'s prices and understanding of its nature, entering the market blindly could be risky. \"Investors should always remember that bitcoin lost more than 75 percent of its value in 2013.

The Grant Thornton Tou Ying Tracker 2016, produced in collaboration with China Daily, shows that 16 fastest-growing Chinese SOEs in the UK grew at an average rate of 146 percent in 2016, while the top 14 private firms grew at an average of 210 percent. The tracking analysis has been conducted in each of the past four years. The latest installment is the first time the authors have divided the list between SOEs and private companies. \"Private firms are becoming a more crucial part of the growth story of Chinese businesses in the UK. This also aligns with what\\\\\\'s going on in China,\" says Jon Wallis, head of China Outbound at Grant Thornton and co-author on the report. China is now publishing foreign direct investment data on a quarterly basis, he says - \"split between SOE and private\" companies. The report, which is based on accounts filed at Companies House in London by Chinese-controlled entities, says the 30 listed businesses employ 25,000 people in the UK and had a combined turnover of 9.8 billion ($11.9 billion; 11.3 billion euros) - down from 35 billion the previous year, which was largely attributed to petrochemical conglomerate Sinochem, with past turnover of 30 billion, not making this year\\\\\\'s report. Telecom giant Huawei, one of the list\\\\\\'s regulars, featured once again, after a year in which the company\\\\\\'s brand recognition in the UK increased significantly and global sales were up for a fifth consecutive year. On Jan 6, the company projected sales revenue of 178 billion yuan ($25.7 billion; 24.3 billion euros; 21.2 billion) for 2016, up by 42 percent from a year ago. A spokesman for Huawei told China Daily that mobile phones \"took off last year, so the most recent breakthrough is on the consumer side\". \"Huawei Consumer BG has achieved great breakthroughs in the European high-end market thanks to strong sales of P9 and P9 Plus.\" Of the private firms, the manufacturing and technology sectors were once again well represented, but surprise new entries in the retail and consumer industries - such as Manchester-based babywear company Brecrest Fashion - highlighted the increasingly diverse array of Chinese-controlled private companies in the UK. \"When we first started doing the tracker a few years ago, what we saw was that the bulk of the Chinese activity in the UK was government-owned - the big banks, some of the big players in energy and so on,\" says Simon Bevan, head of China Britain Services Group at Grant Thornton and co-author of the report. \"These state-owned companies between them have provided a platform, an infrastructure, for the private companies that make up the second wave of Chinese investment into the UK.\" Fourteen of the 16 SOEs in the list arose through organic growth, while mergers and acquisitions accounted for eight of the 14 private firms. Wallis says the acquisition of Brecrest follows from Chinese investment in department store House of Fraser and jewelry retailer Links of London, highlighting an emerging strategy in which Chinese companies are taking control of UK retail brands and bringing them into the Chinese domestic market. This year\\\\\\'s list was once again heavily populated by SOEs from the energy, technology and financial services sectors. Wallis says Bank of China came back \"with a bang\", having been absent from the list since 2014.

Google\\\\\\'s internet search engine may have been out of the Chinese mainland since 2010, but Google, like other global tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft, has ambitious plans for the world\\\\\\'s largest mobile internet market. The California-based giant has launched a Chinese website for local app developers and promises help to take their products global. The developments excite Yan Peng no end. \"Finally, it\\\\\\'s here. This is the best Christmas gift for me. I couldn\\\\\\'t wait to ask for a day off to celebrate this moment,\" the Shanghai-based app developer says. Such gushing praise has been common among Chinese consumers at the launch of much-awaited gadgets like, say, the latest version of the iPhone. But China is no longer just a humongous end-user market. Apps developed in China are increasingly popular among domestic and overseas users. For instance, Clean Master, a junk-cleaning app, has over 400 million overseas users. Bigo Live, a live-streaming app, boasts 7 million monthly active users from Southeast Asian countries, all of whom came on board within three months. Apps developed in China abound these days. Call China an app-developer hub, if you will. This new facet of China is not lost on the world\\\\\\'s tech giants. \"China is now an indispensable part of the global developer community,\" says Ben Galbraith, head of product and developer relations at Google\\\\\\'s developer product group. \"Chinese developers are responsive to new technology and known for high efficiency.\" The trend started a few years back. In 2014, China nosed ahead of India in software development. Out of 18.5 million professional and amateur software developers globally, China accounted for 10 percent, while India had 9.8 percent, according to International Data Corp, the US IT consultancy. A picture of the current scene has yet to emerge, but it is reasonable to assume that the mobile internet boom and China\\\\\\'s digitalization push will likely have boosted the app-developer numbers significantly, says Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner Inc, a US-based technology research and advisory company. Sensing potential, Apple has decided to set up a research and development center in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, later this year. The US tech giant\\\\\\'s announcement came after it set up its first China R&D center in Beijing in September. The work is still on, with total cost expected to reach 300 million yuan ($44.6 million; 41 million euros; 35.1 million), including a staff of 500 employees. Shenzhen, which is an innovation hub, already houses over 100,000 developers for Apple. During his May visit to Beijing, Apple CEO Tim Cook held extensive meetings with local app developers. Apple also invested $1 billion last year in Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing. \"Chinese developers are already technologically strong, and Apple will offer more help on the marketing side to help them venture into overseas markets,\" Cook said at the time. China remains key for Apple, despite tumbling iPhone sales. That\\\\\\'s because the country beat the US to become the largest market for Apple\\\\\\'s iOS app store last year, according to App Annie, an app-tracker. In the third quarter of 2016, Chinese consumers spent $1.7 billion at the iOS app store, more than five times what they had spent just two years ago, App Annie said in an email. Encouraged, Apple organized its first-ever app developer competition in China in October, to encourage university students to work on apps. With spending rising and competition intensifying in the domestic market as a result, Chinese app developers are venturing abroad. Outbound Chinese app-developers often start with utility apps like cache cleaners, anti-virus offerings and data transfer tools, before testing the waters in the content business, which ranges from social media, live streaming and mapping to mobile payment apps. Some have already had a good start, said Wei Fangdan, CEO of BaijingApp, an online community of more than 40,000 domestic app-developers who have global aspirations. As of January 2016, they developed about 270,000 apps that were sold via Apple\\\\\\'s iOS app store. By the end of May, the app developers earned more than $7 billion - and half of that came in the past 12 months, indicating strong growth momentum. In the past two years, Chinese gaming and entertainment app developers saw a 150 percent jump in revenue from Google Play, Google said, without disclosing specific figures. The United States, Japan and South Korea are the top three overseas markets for Chinese app developers. Emerging economies such as India, Mexico and Turkey are new growth drivers, according to App Annie. Interestingly, Chinese app-developers are graduating to cutting-edge technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Perfect World, a Chinese game developer, unveiled its first VR game Subnautica in March. The game enables consumers to be immersed in a virtual sea world and play with underwater creatures. As of June 2016, the PC version of Subnautica generated more than $1 million in monthly sales. The firm is working on mobile virtual reality games. \"There is an abundance of breakthrough innovation coming from China versus the \\\\\\'me too\\\\\\' technology we saw in the past,\" says Zack Weisfeld, general manager of Microsoft Global Accelerators. In December, Microsoft said it would launch its mixed-reality headset HoloLens in China this year, so that more local developers can work on apps for the gadget. \"We believe China could be leading the world in terms of mixed reality. We are seeing more virtual reality activities here than in the United States,\" says Terry Myerson, executive vice-president of Microsoft\\\\\\'s Windows and Devices Division.

Faced with pressure from capital outflows and a further possible decline in forex reserves, the central bank also might use what is known as window guidance or jawboning - which could be indirect persuasion through market-oriented measures - both onshore and offshore to curb the market\\\\\\'s expectations of a sustained depreciation of the yuan, they say. Forex reserves fell by $41 billion (38.8 billion euros; 33.6 billion) in December from the previous month to $3.01 trillion, the lowest level since March 2011, almost hitting the $3 trillion psychological line that the central bank tolerates, as some media reports have put it. \"The current level of forex reserves is still way above what the nation needs to cope with external financial risks,\" says Zhao Qingming, an economist with China Financial Futures Exchange. A close look at the change in capital flows as shown in forex reserves data shows a slew of recent measures have taken effect, according to a report released on Jan 8 by Chinese investment bank CICC. It referrs to measures like strengthened supervision for overseas investment projects and foreign acquisitions. Capital outflows in December amounted to $30.9 billion, far lower than the $46.2 billion in November, according to the report\\\\\\'s estimate. The offshore yuan jumped 2.6 percent in two days last week, the biggest gain against the greenback since 2010. The central parity rate of the yuan strengthened against the US dollar on Jan 6 and stood at 6.8668, the highest level in over a month. Xie Yaxuan, chief economist at China Merchants Securities, says the yuan\\\\\\'s recent surge has perplexed speculators, who expected a sustained depreciation. \"It will be more costly for speculators to bet on depreciation of the yuan,\" says Xie, adding that the central bank has enough tools to choose from to curb speculative behavior if a further drop in forex reserves leads to capital flight pressures. Wang Youxin, an economist at the Institute of International Finance affiliated with the Bank of China, says apart from selling dollars in the forex market, the central bank is able to use more market-oriented approaches to curb depreciation expectations. Such measures include tightening liquidity and boosting interest rates, thus raising the opportunity costs of capital outflows. Ren Zeping, chief economist of Founder Securities, says the warming up of the domestic economy and weakening of the dollar index help create an environment for stabilizing the yuan. In the long run, the central bank may need to allow a completely free fluctuation of exchange rates to avoid a recurrence of depreciation expectations, according to Liu Jie, an economist with China Minsheng Securities. wangyanfei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page26)\\'\\n \\'In 1499 AD, Michelangelo completed the Pieta, a transcendent marriage of classical ideals and divine imagination long considered one of the finest works ever freed from stone.

Nothing matters anymore.\\'\\n \\'China\\\\\\'s passenger vehicle sales last year saw their fastest growth since 2013, but analysts say the momentum will not continue this year. Statistics from the China Passenger Car Association showed that dealers sold 23.9 million sedans, SUVs and MPVs in 2016, a 15.9 percent rise year-on-year, more than double the estimates of several industry organizations, including the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, made at the start of the year. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the CPCA, says the performance was mainly due to a 50 percent tax cut on cars with engines no larger than 1.6 liters, and Chinese motorists\\\\\\' enthusiasm for SUVs. The role of the tax cut was particularly obvious in December, which saw the year\\\\\\'s highest monthly sales of 2.76 million cars as people rushed to dealerships before the policy expired by the end of the year. Yale Zhang, managing director of research firm Automotive Foresight, says: \"The policy was like a huge roadside billboard for the car industry, constantly reminding people that there are some models they should consider buying.\"    Despite the authorities putting in place a 25 percent tax cut for this year, this will still mean that customers have to pay an extra 5,000 yuan ($710; 673 euros; 583) for models priced at around 200,000 yuan, such as the Volkswagen Sagitar or Toyota Camry. SUV sales grew 43.6 percent year-on-year in 2016, the fastest-growing segment in the market. One example of their popularity was that Great Wall Motor Co Ltd sold 80,495 Haval H6 SUVs in December, which means one was sold in every 33 seconds. More than 580,000 H6 were sold in the year. But experts say that the growth rate will plummet now that a huge number of customers have finished purchases in advance and overall economic growth is somewhat slowing down. Cui expects the figure to fall to around 6.5 percent in 2017 while Zhang and John Zeng, managing director of LMC Automotive Consulting (Shanghai), give an even less optimistic estimate of 2 to 3 percent for the year. Zeng says the market would see negative growth without the 25 percent tax cut on small engine cars that took effect this month. However, Zeng is against too much stimulus, insisting that the market should have the final say. He says the favorable policies are like athletes using drugs that produce abnormally high but unsustainable performances. lifusheng@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page25)\\'\\n \\'Garnering many awards, literature from the mainland left a lasting impression on the international stage last year Chinese novels came of age in 2016, bagging many international awards. Children\\\\\\'s writer Cao Wenxuan won the Hans Christian Andersen Award; Hao Jingfang took the Hugo Award (following Liu Cixin, the first Chinese winner of the award in 2015); and Wang Anyi, grabbed the 2017 Newman Prize for Chinese Literature from the University of Oklahoma in September. Veteran literary critic Meng Fanhua says the power of Chinese stories comes from the rural areas, \"where we have the strongest literary traditions\".   - Books published in 2016 in English or Chinese (clockwise from top left): Death\\\\\\'s End by Liu Cixin, Mercy by Lu Nei, Ruined City by Jia Pingwa, Flock of Brown Birds by Ge Fei, The Cocoon by Zhang Yueran and Paper Hawk by Ge Liang. Photos Provided to China Daily  Another veteran critic - Bai Ye, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - says that while traditional and established novel writers continue to produce works, younger writers who were born in the 1970s, 80s and 90s are also gaining ground. \"Every year there are about 5,000 novels published in the country. But, this year, I noticed writers are more keen to reflect the pulse of society, and their writings are close to everyday reality and easier for general readers to accept.\" Bai, who produces an annual report on Chinese novels, adds that rural life is one of the key elements in the books published last year. As urbanization expands, the nostalgia for rural life grows, as seen in Jia Pingwa\\\\\\'s work The Jihua Flower, he says. The novel, about the plight of an abducted girl, stirred a debate about gender equality soon after its release in March. Other themes writers tackled last year were urban life and history. \"It was also a trend for writers to personalize their take on history, offering a touch of warmth to a cold past,\" Bai says, pointing to Mao Dun Literature Award winner Ge Fei\\\\\\'s Wang Chun Feng (or The Spring Breeze) as an example of this kind of work. Wang Chun Feng is about a village\\\\\\'s transformation as seen through the eyes of a young boy.    Giving other examples of these kinds of works, Bai points to Fang Fang\\\\\\'s Bare Burial, a story about a lost family history during and after the country\\\\\\'s land reform, and Lu Nei\\\\\\'s Mercy, about a factory worker\\\\\\'s life before and after China\\\\\\'s reform and opening-up. Another example is Hong Kong-based writer Ge Liang, who was born in 1978, and his semibiographical referring to younger writers, Bai says that those born in the 1980s are making a noticeable impression on their audiences. Zhang Yueran made a mark with The Cocoon, which is about two young people searching for the facts behind the disappearance of their fathers. Online writer Tangjia Sanshao (real name Zhang Wei) also caught Bai\\\\\\'s attention with an autobiographical novel about how a self-made writer achieved fame with help of his wife. Online literature is offering more choices to readers. It \"fills a blank in the Chinese book market\", says Shao Yanjun, a web literature expert at Peking University who says he expects internet literature to be assimilated more into the mainstream.    Eight internet writers were elected to the national committee of the China Writers\\\\\\' Association at the group\\\\\\'s annual meeting in December. Tangjia Sanshao was elected to the presidium of the association. Explaining how internet literature is growing from strength to strength, Shao says it has now become a major source of adaptation for movies and games, and because of its large readership there is a spurt in the sales of TV and film rights of online works in China. For instance, The Interpreters, a TV series based on a work by Miao Juan about the professional and love lives of two language translators, attracted millions of viewers when it hit TV screens in May. As for the money online writers are making, Liu Chang, who started writing science fiction novels full-time in 2012 under the pen name Biting Dog, says that the TV and film adaptation rights for his work Global Evolution is worth around 2 million yuan ($300,000; 270,000 euros; 246,500). \"Internet literature is becoming more diverse in terms of quality and topics,\" says Peking University\\\\\\'s Shao, citing Zeng Dengke (pen name Crazy Banana) as a good example. Zeng writes historical fantasy and tries to match classical literature. Another significant trend noticed by Shao and her students is that Chinese internet literature is attracting Western readers, who are also translating Chinese online novels into English on online forums such as Wuxiaworld.com. The site was started by Chinese-American Lai Jingping, known as RWX on the forum, who quit a foreign service job to start the translation website. As for literary genres that made it big last year, sci-fi was near the top. Wu Yan, director of the Sci-fi Study Center at Beijing Normal University, says he sees more attention being paid to the genre, with a growing number of forums and campus seminars. Even though Hugo Award winner Liu Cixin joked that Chinese scientists were keeping their distance from sci-fi writers, Wu says the China Association for Science and Technology took many initiatives to use sci-fi to promote popular science to the public. Its efforts included organizing the China Sci-Fi Festival, the first large-scale sci-fi event, in Beijing in September. Moreover, sci-fi works have begun to infiltrate classrooms, which once dismissed such works. \"Even startups are focusing on sci-fi,\" he says. \"But, despite the good news for sci-fi in China, I did not see too many good works produced in 2016.\" However, despite his disappointment, Wu recommended a few works. Among his picks were young sci-fi writer Jiang Bo, who recently finished the last installment of his trilogy The Heart of Galaxy, which won the World Chinese Science Fiction Association prize. Wu also recommended River of Time, a work on time travel by 68-year-old Wang Jinkang, who has been writing science fiction for more than 20 years. Other notable mentions included the works of overseas Chinese-Americans published in China, such as short stories by sci-fi writer Ken Liu, whose translations of the works of Liu Cixin and Hao Jingfang helped them win their Hugos. Another Chinese-American who earned a mention was Karen Bao, a graduate of Columbia University, who recently published the first installment of her sci-fi series The Dove Chronicles in China. On a more somber note, 2016 was also the year when China lost two literary stars: Chen Zhongshi and Yang Jiang.

Even if you are not a China expert, you might have been able to guess this one: eating é¥ºå\\\\xad\\\\x90 (jiÇ\\\\x8eozi) thin pieces of dough with ground meat or vegetable filling, steamed or boiled (also known as dumplings). In a country with a history of thousands of years and a diverse culinary culture, it\\\\\\'s hard to imagine that such a commonplace item can be regarded as one of the country\\\\\\'s most representative dishes. It can be said without exaggeration that, at least in northern China (not all over the country - more on that later), jiaozi plays an important role in almost half of Chinese festivals. One should eat jiaozi at Chinese New Year, the fifth day of the first month according to the lunar calendar, the Autumn Commencement, the Winter Commencement and the Winter Solstice. As the Chinese saying goes: \"Food is the god of the people.\"    Alternatively, we can conclude that when foodies really want to eat something, they can always find reasons. The Chinese New Year Eating jiaozi on Chinese New Year\\\\\\'s Eve is the most important custom in northern China during Spring Festival. Families get together around a table to wrap jiaozi together in the evenings and eat them at midnight. That\\\\\\'s because, according to ancient timekeeping customs, a day was divided into 12 two-hour periods and the period between 11 pm and 1 am was called å\\\\xad\\\\x90æ\\\\x97¶(zÇ\\\\x90sh¨ª), or the Zi period. On New Year\\\\\\'s Eve, the Zi period marked the transition from an old year to a new year and had a special name, äº¤å\\\\xad\\\\x90 (jiÄ\\\\x81ozÇ\\\\x90), which sounded very similar to jiaozi. What\\\\\\'s more, the shape of a jiaozi is just like a gold yu¨¢nbÇ\\\\x8eo (å\\\\x85\\\\x83å®\\\\x9d, ingot), an ancient currency, so people eat jiaozi at the dinner with the wish that they will have prosperity in the new year. Some cooks will hide a coin inside a jiaozi and whoever happens to find it is said to have good luck in the coming year.    The fifth day of the first month in the lunar calendar Just five days after New Year\\\\\\'s Eve, people eat jiaozi again. This custom is called \"breaking the fifth\", or ç\\\\xa0´äº\\\\x94 (pÃ²wÇ\\\\x94), because there are so many taboos during the Spring Festival period such as doing needlework, breaking things, getting your hair cut and so on. However, after the fifth day after the New Year, those taboos don\\\\\\'t exist anymore, so people celebrate by eating jiaozi. A special custom exists in the city of Tianjin and surrounding areas, where people believe that when you wrap jiaozi, you need to press the wrapper edges tightly so that people who like to talk about you behind your back will have their mouths zipped in the coming year. The start of the Fu days The Fu days can be understood as the \"dog days\" of the Chinese summer, which usually last 30 or 40 days between the traditional calendar seasons of \"Little Heat\" and \"Great Heat\". The first day of Fu is another jiaozi day. Because the Fu days are the hottest time of the year, people usually lack appetite, so something delicious is needed to stimulate their taste buds. Jiaozi, a popular food that many people liked since ancient times, became the optimal choice. And because the Fu days took place during the start of harvest, every household could afford the good meal. The start of autumn When the high temperature that takes away people\\\\\\'s appetites finally drops, cool autumn arrives, and it\\\\\\'s definitely worth celebrating. On the Autumn Commencement day of the lunar calendar, it is believed people should eat something good, especially meat, to è´´ç§\\\\x8bè\\\\x86?(tiÄ\\\\x93 qiÅ«biÄ\\\\x81o) gain autumn weight, because most people have lost some weight during the long hot summer and need to gain it back to stay healthy during the winter. Of course, for jiaozi lovers, dumplings with meat filling works perfectly. The start of winter When the weather is hot, you eat jiaozi; when it\\\\\\'s cold, jiaozi-lovers will eat jiaozi, too. Eating jiaozi on the Winter Commencement day is one of the best-known jiaozi customs in China, and it is related to the origin of jiaozi. Though there are many folk stories explaining how jiaozi was invented, the most popular one was about the famous doctor Zhang Zhongjing. Zhang was a great practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, who lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220). One day in winter, when Zhang was on his way home, he found many poor people had frostbitten ears, because they didn\\\\\\'t have warm clothes and sufficient food. Zhang tried to heal their ears. He stewed lamb, peppers and some medicine in a pot, chopped them into small pieces and used them to fill small dough wrappers. Zhang named these dumplings å¨\\\\x87è\\\\x80?jiÄ\\\\x81o\\\\\\'Ä\\\\x9br), literally meaning \"tender ear\", and boiled them every day to feed his patients. Gradually, these patients became better and, when Spring Festival came, their ears were healed. In order to express their gratitude to Zhang, people began to imitate his recipe to make jiao\\\\\\'er, which later became the current jiaozi, and ate them to celebrate Spring Festival. The winter solstice Chinese people have long placed a great deal of importance on the winter solstice. Family members get together, worship their ancestors and eat jiaozi. Some claim the reason people eat jiaozi on this day is also to commemorate Zhang Zhongjing, while others said it\\\\\\'s because of a goddess in ancient Chinese legend, N¨¹wa, who is known for creating humans and repairing a great hole that one day appeared the sky. It is said that N¨¹wa existed at the beginning of the world and created humans by sculpting them with yellow clay. But when she made ears for these humans, she worried that the clay would freeze and the ears wouldn\\\\\\'t stay attached to their heads when it became cold. Therefore, she pierced their ears and used a string to fix them to their heads. So, on the winter solstice, which is the darkest and one of the coldest times of year, people make and eat the ear-shaped jiaozi in memory of N¨¹wa, and it\\\\\\'s said if you don\\\\\\'t eat jiaozi this day, your ears will freeze and drop from your head. Jiaozi lovers can always find a reason to eat jiaozi, but the interesting thing is that it just happens in the north, where there is a tradition of eating wheat-based food. Southern people, whose traditional dishes tend to be based more on rice, are not crazy about it, even though as more people migrate around the country for work and consume mass media (such as CCTV\\\\\\'s documentary about jiaozi as the ultimate Chinese festival food), the northern customs are becoming better known and even adopted by some southerners. However, traditionally, southerners had other choices for festivals. At Spring Festival, they eat tangyuan or fried nian\\\\\\'gao, traditional dishes made from sticky rice; on the winter solstice, they eat tangyuan; for Lantern Festival they of course also eat tangyuan. There are also dishes special to certain regions; other winter solstice foods, for instance, include fried sticky rice consumed in the Jiangnan region, nine-layer rice cakes and soy flour-covered sweet round cakes made of glutinous rice paste in parts of the southeastern coast (and Taiwan), noodles and pumpkin patties in Anhui province and mutton soup in Shandong. After all, China is a vast land so to designate one dish as the official festival food would probably lead to a civil war - but at least we can agree that the holidays are the perfect excuse to binge on all your favorite dishes.

Very warm clothes. A lot of them. Temperatures in China\\'s northernmost county plummet to a biting -40 C at night.   - Clockwise from top left: Tourists aboard one-horse sleighs in Santa Village in China\\'s northernmost county of Mohe, Heilongjiang province; a visitor plays a popular game of splashing hot water, which freezes instantly in the cold air; villagers hack a hole in the river and push a net down for fish; a reindeer-drawn sleigh in front of the Santa\\'s house. Liu Xiangrui / China Daily  Days aren\\'t much warmer. But its icy climate is exactly what gives the small border settlement in Heilongjiang province its appeal. At least much of it. China is said to be shaped like a rooster. Mohe perches on the crest that prods Russia\\'s belly. Such offerings as the northern lights have elevated its position on the tourism map. I recently visited the county and spent a few relaxing - and freezing - days in Beiji village, the country\\'s northernmost community. It was worth enduring the cold to experience Mohe\\'s magic. I\\'d prepared fretfully. I borrowed thick shoes and other winterwear from friends. But I realized I had to buy even warmer footwear upon arrival. Still, my feet froze. Nonetheless, I was excited, as were the other tourists in our group from the southern province of Guangdong. We spent the first night in the county town, where illuminated ice and snow sculptures lined the streets. We headed to Beiji the next day. About two decades ago, it was a poor hamlet. Today, it\\'s a national 5A tourist attraction, the highest level. We climbed a lookout tower halfway to the village and saw a river snaking through woodlands of rime-sheathed trees. Then we enjoyed a stroll along a boardwalk through birch forests. The village is situated on the southern bank of the Heilongjiang River, which marks the border with Russia. Travelers come to visit China\\'s northernmost post office, bank and primary school. But its biggest single attraction is the aurora borealis. It\\'s said to be the only place in China where the electromagnetic phenomenon can be seen. Hundreds of photographers flock to the destination every summer in hope of capturing the northern lights - although sightings are rare in the warmer months. I enjoyed it most when the village went silent after 10 pm. We used phone apps to detect constellations among the countless stars. We were able to snap a couple of satisfying photos of the Milky Way after standing outdoors for nearly two hours. Despite the late night, we got up around 6 am to enjoy seeing the sunrise from a an observation tower. Morning light sparkled on the rime-encrusted woodland. Haze drifted through the valley. Chimney smoke coiled from dwellings on the river\\'s Russian side. Such scenery is best explored aboard a one-horse open sleigh (jingle bells not included). The village has a team of drivers, and passengers ride under quilts in the vehicles. We watched them whoosh by on our way to go ice fishing. Villagers hack holes in the river and use a long pole to push a net down. A day or two later, they return to collect their catch. The fish are said to be particularly tasty but hauls depend on luck. Afterward, we headed to the nearby Santa Village. It happened to be a few days before Christmas and it was looking a lot like it everywhere we went. Here, St. Nick\\'s job isn\\'t making a list, checking it twice and finding out who\\'s naughty or nice. It\\'s posing for photos with tourists. Spoiler alert: As Mohe isn\\'t really the North Pole, Santa isn\\'t really Kriss Kringle but rather a Finnish native who plays the part. Mostly, his job is posing for photos with guests. Speaking of poles, we did see a pole-dancing party in front of Santa\\'s house. An unlikely venue, perhaps. But seasonal performances are staged in which dancers dazzle crowds for up to five minutes outdoors with nothing but bikinis to shield them from the cold. Hearty fare helps stave off the cold in Mohe. I particularly enjoyed goose stewed with potatoes in a traditional wood-fired oven. As we dined, more ingredients were added - pickled Chinese cabbage and frozen tofu - a local specialty. On our way back to the county town, we stopped by Old Gold Valley to learn about the region\\'s history. The yellow mineral was discovered in a 14-kilometer-long gorge over a century ago. A rush began and prospectors flooded the riverbanks in the following decades. Gold can still be found in the sand, our guide says. Today, perhaps the snowy climate\\'s tourism appeal makes white the new gold in Mohe. liuxiangrui@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page19)\"\\n \\'Editor\\\\\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. It is a dish full of history, and there are about as many myths and legends attached to it as there are ingredients in the recipe. Unlike many Chinese classics for the dinner table, this one has no fancy title. It is simply known as pencai, or \"dish in a basin\". The name reflects the presentation. Layers of food are stacked on top of one another in a large serving pot or basin. To find out why, we need to hark back to its origins.     - The layerings of meat and vegetables provide a delicate harmony of taste and texture. Photos by Chuai Meitu / For China Daily   Many versions of how this dish came about are floating around the wild blue yonder of the internet, but the elements are largely the same as the story my mother told me when I first tasted pencai in Hong Kong decades ago. The story involved a fugitive king or general washed up on the shores of either Shenzhen or Hong Kong - cold, hungry and in need of the kindness of strangers. The strangers were variously fishermen or village folk, depending on which version of the story one prefers. Out of sympathy and respect, the common folk brought out the best ingredients they had in their homes and cooked for their down-and-out visitor. They were so poor they didn\\\\\\'t have enough spare crockery for guests, so the food was served from a wooden basin. One thing everyone agreed on was the Hakka element. The Hakka are the \"guest people\" - emigrants from the Central Plains who settled in the coastal provinces of the south, notably Fujian and Guangdong. In Hong Kong they built villages surrounded by low enclosures called weicun, or walled villages. In neighboring Shenzhen, they formed fishing communities and also settled in the hills of nearby Meizhou. There is historical evidence that the royal refugee would most likely have been hosted by a Hakka community. The Hakka are famous to this day for their pencai, which is eaten on festive occasions such as birthdays, weddings and on the eve of the lunar new year, during the reunion dinner.    It is a masterpiece of cooking skill and frugality, with expert layering of ingredients that sound contradictory but actually provide a delicate harmony of taste and texture. At the very bottom of the large basin is a layer of braised radish, a root vegetable that withstands long cooking and readily absorbs the juices of meat and seafood. On top of the radish is usually braised pork belly, its rich fat leaching down to nourish the radishes. The pork may be topped with fried tofu or gluten balls, which again soak up the fatty meat juices and act as a soft barrier for the next layer. Roast duck or steamed chicken on top of the tofu or gluten adds distinctive flavor and texture - especially duck, whose fat lends a special fragrance to the dish. The next layer, again vegetables, is likely to be thick slices of yam or taro, chosen for the ability to complement meat. The layering will go on, alternating meat, seafood and vegetables until the chef runs out of imagination and ingredients. Generally, the best ingredients are displayed on the very top, and some pencai may even see the luxurious addition of dried scallops, whole abalones or sea cucumber. Other ingredients used may include dried oysters, prawns, fish maw, crab, fish cakes or meatballs. In fact, the pencai may be assembled from very economical items, not just expensive, exclusive treats. Pencai is popular in Huaiyang cuisine as well, a cooking style that is quickly gaining popularity in China for its lighter, natural flavors. It has traveled far from its Yangzhou-Huai\\\\\\'an roots and is now often served at state banquets, including dinners served at the Great Hall of the People. A senior colleague from Yangzhou says the Huaiyang version of pencai also has the characteristic layerings of meat and vegetables. What makes it different is that it will have two very Huaiyang ingredients - danjiao and fish meatballs. Danjiao are dumplings made with an egg skin. Beaten egg is poured into a heated ladle and swirled until slightly set. A spoonful of filling is added and the dumpling is quickly folded over. The dumplings are laid out in rows in the pencai to fully cook. Fish meatballs are equally laborious to make. The filleted meat of the freshest fish is scraped and minced and beaten together until it forms a light, white cloud. With a dexterous squeeze and twist, a meatball is formed and dropped into boiling water. The finished meatballs are then added to the pencai. Huaiyang cuisine only uses sea cucumber to top the dish, and skips the abalone. The dish has also been duplicated in the north, where it\\\\\\'s known as quanjiafu, or \"family reunion\". However, the ingredients may be more rough-and-ready, and it may lose some of its southern finesse. The romance of the dish seems to fade as it travels. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn A popular dish for Spring Festival reunions A new culinary phenomenon that has surfaced in recent years is the hotel hamper for Spring Festival. In many ways, it is like the traditional Christmas hamper, minus the turkey or ham. It also reflects the changing lifestyle of many urban Chinese. A series of family meals is a traditional part of the festivities, starting with the reunion dinner on New Year\\\\\\'s Eve. The first day of the Chinese New Year sees another gathering of family and friends, and the feasting may go on for a week. While in the past a battalion of mothers, aunts and sisters would be churning out dishes from the kitchen, it is getting increasingly likely that food may be ordered in. This is where the hotel hampers come in, with their gifts of cakes, buns and a large ready-to-heat pot of pencai, an ideal dish for such occasions, All you need to do is to reheat the pot on a low fire and wait until the ingredients are again warm and bubbling. Cooking time is minimal because the dish has been prepared in advance. And its ready mix of seafood, meat and vegetables is a luxurious and impressive treat for all.    (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page20)\\'\\n \\'A 30-volume series of children\\\\\\'s books received a lot attention online in China recently, not just because of its sheer size but also because of the source of its financial backing - crowdfunding organized by an online bookshop. The illustrations in the 30 volumes of stories, taken from all over the world, reflect the breadth of the books and the stories in them - 3,000 pictures by 30 illustrators from various countries and regions, such as Francesca Greco and Valentina Fiore Perla from Italy. \"There are stories from Grimm\\\\\\'s Fairy Tales and from the Middle East, and of course illustrators from those countries and regions are very well suited to that job,\" says Hou Mingliang, founder of IlluSalon, a company in Beijing that aims to bring together illustrators and those who use illustrations. \"Prices of illustrations can vary widely, depending largely on the local economy. There may be little difference in the quality of works when you compare various places, but some will be expensive while others are extremely cheap. \"With IlluSalon, publishers have many choices and can make decisions based on their needs and their budgets.\" In China, publishers have long paid students in fine arts academies a pittance to churn out illustrations for books. \"There is a joke about those cheap illustrations,\" says Gao Shan, chief executive of IlluSalon. \"If you go to many illustrations and remove the hair or skin color of the figures in them you will find that all the eyes and noses - including those of dogs, cats and humans - are similar.\" One reason such conditions have prevailed for so long is that there is a scarcity of good channels through which anyone can find suitable illustrators, Hou says. \"Also, publishers demand the best illustrations, but are not willing to pay accordingly,\" Hou says. IlluSalon was founded in 2014 at a time when an upswing in demand in China for good-quality illustrations and picture books was emerging. \"We have lived through the printing era and the writing era and are now in the audiovisual era,\" Hou says. \"So people are crying out for more pictures, especially really creative ones that express a creator\\\\\\'s ideas.\" IlluSalon has been the driving force behind a new event that recognizes artistic talent, the Global Illustration Award. At the Frankfurt Book Fair in October, IlluSalon hosted the awards ceremony. More than 10,000 entries from five continents were received in two months, in five illustration categories: covers, children\\\\\\'s books, editorial, scientific, and one entitled \"Learning to live together\". The awards went to 15 artists from seven countries and regions. One of the original aims of IlluSalon was to bring foreign illustrators into the Chinese market as it continues to grow. Further down the road, the idea is to introduce Chinese illustrators to the world. IlluSalon says it has signed contracts with about 1,000 foreign illustrators, mainly from Europe. \"Illustrators who want to join us can show us their works,\" Hou says. \"After signing a contract with us we will link illustrators with customers, and eventually we should have a stable of great illustrators. They will be the backbone of IlluSalon.\" Under IlluSalon\\\\\\'s plans the website would eventually become a trading platform akin to taobao.com. Illustrators would post introductions of themselves and their works on the website, and potential customers would use key words to search for works or creators. IlluSalon says that in addition to publishers, it has customers from other fields such as Apple and the global advertising agency Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn. IlluSalon says it has found illustrators from all over the world to paint emoji packages that users can pay to download from Apple. \"We want to build a platform through which the creative abilities of illustrators and their works can circulate efficiently globally,\" Hou says.   ( China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page16)\\'\\n \\'Illustrators struggle to draw attention to the value of their work Two-and-a-half millennia after Confucius said that \"one seeing is worth a hundred hearings\", some bright spark in the English-speaking world took a leaf out of the great sage\\\\\\'s book and came up with \"a picture is worth a thousand words\". The West gave birth last century to an industry that employs millions of people who provide illustrations for books, cataloges, advertising and other media. And, yet somewhere along the way, in China the old message seems to have been overlooked. Only in recent years has the printed picture begun to make an impact as a medium par excellence for getting messages across in many different areas.   - Children\\\\\\'s picture books have been growing in popularity in the past few years. Xu han (inset), one of the artists who caters to this genre, created the iconic character Ali. Photos Provided to China Daily     - One of the drawings by Zhang Yunbao, an editor and illustrator of children\\\\\\'s picture books.    One of those who is aware of how far China has lagged behind - but is now seeing it making strides to catch up - is Zhang Yunbao, 29, a children\\\\\\'s picture book editor for Beijing Poplar Culture Project Co. In her free time she draws commercial illustrations and makes her own picture books. Zhang has worked in the field for five years and says she has noticed that in the past two years demand for both commercial illustrations and children\\\\\\'s picture books has begun to take off, \"which holds the prospect of a much bigger market in coming years\". \"You can see that illustrations are increasingly wanted by online shops, clothing brands, cellphone brands and booths in shopping malls.\" Over each of the past 10 years, sales of children\\\\\\'s picture books have grown by an average of 10 to 12 percent in China, says Hou Mingliang, founder of IlluSalon, an organization founded in Beijing in 2014 to promote the use of illustrations in China and bring together illustrators and customers. Hou has worked in children\\\\\\'s book publishing for eight years.    As China fulfils its mission of ensuring that most of its citizens are clothed, fed and feeling well-off materially, the public is developing an appetite for intellectual and spiritual nourishment that only education and the arts, such as music, literature and painting can give, he says. Li Ajiu, 32, a freelance illustrator in Shanghai, says that just 10 years ago when she graduated from university, illustrated books were hard to come by in China, but now they are everywhere. That is partly because parents have come to accept the concept of picture books, she says. Hou says: \"Picture books with beautiful illustrations, good stories and creative storytelling will exert great influence on children, who construct the world and connect themselves with society through them. So good picture books are very important.\" However, 85 percent of children\\\\\\'s picture books are imported and only 15 percent are domestic creations, Hou says. Chinese parents prefer to buy imported picture books for their children because the values reflected in the stories are expressed in more creative ways and the quality is generally better than that of domestic works, he says. \"And for publishing houses, good-quality imported picture books - particularly ones that have won awards - are safer in the market.\" Some people attribute this to the longer history of the illustration tradition in Europe and the United States, which cultivate highly talented illustrators. Hou and Zhang, say many other factors are hampering the growth of the domestic illustration industry. Zhang can recall few cases in which those who have ordered illustrations from her have offered a contract for her to sign. In most cases the only communication is by email and, without legal protection, some illustrators have to fight to get paid even after their work has been used. Apart from requiring artistic talent and training, creating an illustration is time-consuming, and most illustrators who have not made a name for themselves struggle to survive on meager earnings. In fact, many of Zhang\\\\\\'s illustrator friends say trying to make a living from their art is out of the question. \"They all love painting, but they have to live,\" she says. Han Dan, 28, an illustrator who is known on the internet as Ghost Master, is an editor at Chemical Industry Press in Beijing. The lethargic growth in the publication of original picture books in China is partly the result of a dearth of picture book editors in publishing houses and elsewhere she says. Zhang says: \"Apart from illustrators, most people do not know about illustrations, what kind of illustrators they need or what kind of creative styles they want. People in other fields know little about art and painting.\" For Han, another problem is the limited scope that illustrators have for selling their work. \"In China, picture books are mainly for children, and that means illustrators have a very limited space in which to express themselves.\" Hou says that in Europe, illustrations were originally created by people to express their ideas or imagination on canvas. Some of the more personal illustrations that carried the wisdom of older generations may have been shown to the young as a means of education. He cites The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter, saying that Potter originally just painted for herself without thinking about publishing. But after she showed the stories to a friend, he encouraged her to publish them. Peter Rabbit then became a popular picture book, which has become a classic. \"Many European illustrators draw very personal stories and then have them published,\" Hou says. Han has rarely drawn commercial illustrations because \"they usually don\\\\\\'t like my style, which is cool, not that kind of warm or light style\". She has been working intermittently on stories about ghosts living in another world. \"I have talked to people on an online illustration platform. Obviously what they are looking for are illustrations for children books, so for them weird or cold, dark themes and colors are out. \"I know some Chinese illustrators who are really good. You may say they lack creativity compared with people in Europe or the United States but that\\\\\\'s because they cannot express themselves fully.\" To gauge the quality of illustrations in a certain country you have to see the general level of the illustrators, not just a few of the top ones, Hou says. \"Maybe this is going to offend some people, but the average level of Chinese illustrators is low. Many are just craftspeople who are good at technique but lack the quality to become masters because they don\\\\\\'t have a big enough reserve of culture, including literature, music and painting. \"China\\\\\\'s arts education is twisted. Students who go to fine art academies are usually those who may not be able to enter general universities. Ideas are most important for illustrations and the images are secondary. \"So there is still a long way to go. Nowadays, Chinese people, on average, read no more than five books annually, compared with more than 60 in Israel.\" College teacher Xu Han creates stories about Ali, the popular red fox. Now he is directing a movie about the character. He says that when he creates the picture books, the biggest challenge he faces is writing good stories rather than getting the painting technique right. \"The core of a picture book is the story. To write a good story you have to build up a big collection of ideas from everyday life,\" he says. The task that illustrators or designers face covers more than just artistic technique and form. It also entails trying to express oneself through the content, Xu says. Zhang says that when she was deciding which university to attend her father, who always encouraged her to chase her dreams, suggested that she should go to a comprehensive university rather than a special one. \"When I was little, my father told me to find the thing I really love and pursue it as a career. Of course, academies of fine arts have their advantages, with better faculties and richer artistic perspectives for students. \"My father said, \\\\\\'I know you love painting, but at an academy of fine arts you will be surrounded by nothing but arts. If you go to a comprehensive university there are various kinds of things you can learn about, which I think is better for your development\\\\\\'. \"I personally believe that illustrators need to care about more than painting - things such as literature, movies, theater, photography or child psychology. You also need to know about society. These things are connected.\" Luo Qianxi, 26, a freelance illustrator in Beijing, says China\\\\\\'s illustration industry lacks organizations or agencies that can help creators promote their works. \"Illustrators spend most of their time and energy on creation. They don\\\\\\'t know how to find customers or promote themselves. On the other hand, there are many well-developed organizations and agencies in Europe that help illustrators promote themselves and find customers. They also have good platforms to sell their works,\" Luo says. In addition, in Europe people generally are more familiar with the illustration industry and often support and respect illustrators\\\\\\' works, she says. In China, piracy is also a big problem, says Xia Mengyu, another freelance illustrator. However, Hou believes that in the future illustrations will become mainstream in China and even part of everyday life. They will appear everywhere, and people will use them to decorate their houses or to promote their products, he says. Good works will be collected and stored. \"This is an audiovisual era, and the day will come soon.\" yangyang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page16)\\'\\n \\'Advances in medicine, physics and technology are among those called vital for nation\\\\\\'s progress President Xi Jinping presented the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award on Jan 9 to Tu Youyou, co-winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, and physicist Zhao Zhongxian, recognizing the country\\\\\\'s booming innovation. Tu is best known for discovering artemisinin, a substance derived from the traditional Chinese medicine qinghaosu, which is used to treat malaria. She is the first woman to receive the national award. Zhao Zhongxian, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has spent four decades researching superconductors. Twenty-seven scientists have received the nation\\\\\\'s top science and technology award since it was established in 2000. It comes with a prize of 5 million yuan ($721,000; 680,900 euros; 595,900). The award is one way the government encourages fundamental research, Premier Li Keqiang said at the ceremony. Scientists should be dedicated to patient research since China is in greater need of scientific progress than at any other time, he said. Li paraphrased a Chinese proverb, saying that scientists \"could stay silent for a decade\" but \"try to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat\". He vowed to protect intellectual property rights, which he said are crucial for innovation. The nation will have sustainable development only by relying on innovation, he said. Li also expressed gratitude to the foreign scientists and scholars who have contributed to China\\\\\\'s scientific progress. The country welcomes foreign scholars for entrepreneurship and innovation, he said, adding that the government will provide opportunities and facilities for international talent willing to work in China.

Experts says the regulation, passed at the annual plenary meeting of the top anti-corruption watchdog - the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China - can help ensure an unsullied disciplinary team, after some corrupt investigators were exposed. The regulation, details of which were not released, sets clear standards on how to handle corruption tips, how to check and review cases and how to manage ill-gotten money and assets, according to a report published on the commission\\\\\\'s website on Jan 8. It also encourages audio and video recordings throughout the entire process of the interrogation and the establishment of a registration system for those who make inquiries about, or try to interfere in, the cases, the report said. \"Trust (in disciplinary officials) cannot replace supervision,\" a meeting communique released on Jan 8 said. \"We must make sure the power granted by the Party and the people is not abused.\" Many commission members who attended the three-day meeting say they have felt rising pressure on disciplinary officials. In recent years, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly required officials to \"clean house\" to ensure a trustworthy disciplinary team. \"As those who enforce anti-graft rules, we must first place ourselves under scrutiny,\" says Liu Qifan, head of the anti-corruption watchdog in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. China launched a massive anti-corruption and austerity campaign as the top Party leadership was elected in late 2012. Xi said on Jan 6 that years of effort have stopped corruption from spreading, and a \"crushing momentum\" against graft has taken shape. However, some disciplinary officials have become conceited with the anti-corruption achievements, and a small number of them have loosened their self-restraint and become corrupt themselves, says Wang Yanfei, head of the provincial discipline watchdog in Sichuan province. Since late 2012, more than 7,900 disciplinary officials from across the country have been punished for various types of wrongdoing, with 17 from the top anti-corruption watchdog being placed under investigation in graft probes, according to figures from the commission. Recently, a three-episode TV documentary produced by the commission, named To Forge an Iron, One Must Be Strong Oneself, offered the public a rare glimpse into guilty officials from discipline inspection authorities. It featured the cases of 10 former anti-graft officials, including Zhu Mingguo, who was once in charge of fighting corruption in Guangdong province. In the documentary, Zhu, convicted in November of taking bribes of 141 million yuan ($20.4 million; 19 million euros, 16 million), admitted that he made use of his position. He said he received over a thousand bottles of expensive alcohol as gifts, and had taken bribes as far back as the 1990s. \"It is very rare for the commission to make such a documentary for publicity,\" says Xie Chuntao, director of the Dean\\\\\\'s Office of the CPC Central Committee Party School, adding that the move also reflects the commission\\\\\\'s determination to strengthen self-supervision.

A cost ceiling for players should be set to curb the mounting financial burden on clubs, the General Administration of Sport of China, the country\\\\\\'s top sports body, said in a statement released on Jan 5. It also said more transparent financial auditing of clubs should be conducted. \"A series of issues, such as clubs spending excessively on overpriced foreigners - while neglecting investment in youth training - have been hampering the long-term development of the game,\" the statement said. Chinese Super League clubs spent $363 million (345 million euros; 298 million) on star imports early last year, followed by the arrival of another costly foreign legion in December, including Brazilian midfielder Oscar and Argentine striker Carlos Tevez. On Dec 23, Oscar was signed by Shanghai SIPG, from English Premier League giant Chelsea, for $63.5 million, eclipsing the previous record of $58.9 million paid by SIPG for his compatriot Hulk in July. Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, another CSL club in the city, announced three days later the signing of Tevez, a former Manchester City striker, from Argentine club Boca Juniors for $11 million over two-years. With CSL\\\\\\'s winter transfer window open until Feb 28, more expensive signings are expected. Some established overseas professional sports leagues, such as the National Basketball Association, have long used salary caps to keep the investment of each team within a reasonable range. However, it would be difficult for Chinese football to cap itself at the moment, despite good intentions, observers say. \"The sentiment is a positive thing, as the spending is clearly way out of control. It\\\\\\'s a good thing that people in power look to try to control the spending,\" says Mark Dreyer, founder of the China Sports Insider website. \"The problem is that it\\\\\\'s extremely hard to institute a cap to an existing league, and to get it right with the amount,\" he says, because the salary cap constantly changes in overseas leagues based on league income. \"To bring it into existing leagues, with players already fixed on multi-year contract, is very tricky,\" Dreyer says. Tan Jianxiang, a sports sociology expert at South China Normal University, says clubs could still bypass the mandatory ceiling by compensating their star players in the name of training or traffic subsidies. \"The administration should focus more on making policies to inspire more investment in youth development, rather than dictating the financial operation of the league,\" he says. The administration also said in its Jan 5 statement that the CSL should allocate funding from its annual revenues to support the development of reserve teams and youth leagues. sunxiaochen@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page14)\\'\\n \\'But nature is not always kind. Fifty percent of the world\\\\\\'s lion population lives in East Africa -- and lions like to eat livestock. Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds, often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions. There were ritual killings also, known as \"Ala-mayo.\" Killing a lion, a symbol of strength and power, was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into \"Morani,\" the warrior class. Armed with a spear, these youths became men in the process, returning to the tribe to be treated with new-found respect. The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s, but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned. In Ngorongoro Crater, north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959, the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence. In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year, but as with so much of the world in the 20th century, the Maasai\\\\\\'s population grew in Ngorongoro. Forty lions, if not more, are now under threat annually in the conservation area, and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining. Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed, and in a remarkable turnaround they\\\\\\'ve enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe: the Maasai themselves. At around 5am the Maasai \"Wildlife Warriors\" rise to birdsong, nature\\\\\\'s alarm clock. A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day. Slipping on a pair of sandals, their soles recycled from old car tires, the Warriors head out of their \"kraal,\" a small sheltered community, to begin tracking. These Maasai have traded in their hunting ways for a life of conservation. Part of an initiative run by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund, an organization specializing in human-animal conflict, the Warriors are spread across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland, using their skills, their lifeblood, to protect what was once their adversary. Beyond the \"boma,\" a low wall surrounding the \"kraal,\" tracks line the dirt. They betray the lions, hyenas and wild dogs who visit in the night, drawn to livestock and, in the dry season, the community\\\\\\'s water supply. On an uneventful day, Warriors might take a car owned by the Fund and conduct an animal headcount, circling the Steppe in the early morning. But sometimes tracks start inside the \"boma,\" suggesting a big cat. When big cat footprints are involved, they usually lead to a kill. The next step is crucial. \"People are becoming more and more angry towards wildlife,\" says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje. In the past a carcass resulted in retribution. The head of cattle per person has decreased among the Maasai in recent years, meaning the pain of every loss is felt all the more. \"The community finds it very difficult to comprehend the importance of the wildlife,\" Lengoje adds. \"It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe you, as they care more about their livestock than wildlife.\" Some of the reprisals have become extreme. Aside from spearings, Maasai have begun poisoning carcasses between a lion\\\\\\'s initial gorge and second feed. This not only kills the lion, but anything that feeds on the lion\\\\\\'s subsequent carcass. Wildlife Warriors intercede, dissipate the situation, and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them. One of their primary concerns is to document the attack and location, using GPS to map the incident on the Fund\\\\\\'s database. They\\\\\\'ll also warn neighboring herders of the dangers nearby, and sometimes provide contact details so Maasai can claim compensation from the government. Then begins the long-term approach to preventing cattle loss. \"Living Walls\" (African myrrh trees joined by chain link fences) are being used by the Fund and built in collaboration with the Maasai, and have been rolled out across communities. \"The difference between the \\\\\\'boma\\\\\\' and the Living Wall is that the living wall uses chain link,\" explains Elvis Kisimir, from the Fund. \\\\\\'Bomas\\\\\\' contain dried twigs from the thorny acacia bush, but chain link is infinitely more effective, especially when fortified with living, fast-growing thorny trees, which only become more impassable with age. In the wet season these walls reach over 12 feet high. \"We currently have more than 700 \\\\\\'bomas,\\\\\\' and the Living Wall is a program that has safeguarded 99% of our livestock at night,\" says Kisimir. This immediate success is being supplemented with education programs fronted by Maasai Wildlife Warriors, aimed at neutralizing any antagonism between man and his fellow predators. \"If we decided to do this on our own, we wouldn\\\\\\'t achieve much,\" admits Kisimir. \"Community is everything.\" Laly Lichtenfeld, executive director of the Fund, describes this as \"the next step,\" and a way to help create a self-regulating environment in which both Maasai and lions can prosper. \"The Maasai people are absolutely critically integral to the conservation process in northern Tanzania,\" she adds. \"This is their land, and their livelihoods are so dependent on wise environmental stewardship. \"Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock. And the livestock, the cattle, are core of their being -- who they are. It\\\\\\'s their pride, it\\\\\\'s their identity; it\\\\\\'s their economic wellbeing. And so if they can manage to really keep these ecosystems intact and healthy, then everything in the system benefits.\"\\'\\n \\'- Vice-Premier Liu Yandong (right) interacts with winners of the International Science and Technology Cooperation Award and their families after an annual ceremony to honor distinguished scientists and research achievements in Beijing on Jan 9.

In the 32 cities where traffic worsened, it took almost twice as long to reach a destination during rush hours - from 7 to 9 am and 5 to 7 pm - than it took at off-peak hours, the company said. Traffic in 36 cities was unchanged from the previous year, while 32 cities improved, the report said.

It is expected to be finished in five years. Gravitational waves, predicted by Albert Einstein in 1915 as part of his general theory of relativity, are generated when celestial bodies collide. Code of conduct for sea takes shape China confirmed on Jan 11 that it will complete a framework with Southeast Asian nations by the middle of the year for a code of conduct governing the South China Sea. Negotiation on the code has entered an important phase, Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said at a news conference at which a white paper was released on China\\\\\\'s Asia-Pacific security cooperation and policy. Liu added that heavier work will come after the draft is completed. Fireworks outlets reduced for festival Beijing will reduce sales of fireworks during Spring Festival by cutting the number of retail outlets, authorities said on Jan 11. Fireworks will be sold at 511 outlets, down 29 percent from last year, according to authorities. Sales will be allowed from Jan 22 to Feb 1, authorities said. If orange or red alerts are issued for heavy air pollution, delivery and sales of fireworks will be suspended. Medical reform plan issued The State Council issued a plan on Jan 9 for medical reform during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20). Signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the plan addresses diagnosis and treatment systems, hospital administration, medical security, medical supplies and a regulatory system. A multitiered diagnosis and treatment system commensurate with Chinese conditions should be in place by 2020. Yao Ming to co-lead CBA election group Retired basketball star Yao Ming\\\\\\'s pivotal role in the game\\\\\\'s professional reform in China grew on Jan 9 with his involvement in the upcoming election of the new Chinese Basketball Association leadership. Yao, a former NBA All-Star, was named on Jan 9 the co-head of a preparatory group for the general election of the CBA, which is scheduled for March, the CBA said in a statement. According to a report in Basketball Pioneers newspaper on Jan 2, the General Administration of Sport of China, the nation\\\\\\'s sports regulator, made 10 proposals during an internal meeting on basketball\\\\\\'s future development, two of which involved Yao. The first called for discussion of Yao becoming the new chairman, and the second reportedly was to invite Yao to be head coach of the national men\\\\\\'s team. Endangered birds spotted in Wenzhou    Fifteen Chinese mergansers, an endangered bird species under state Class 1 protection, were spotted in Wenzhou, a bird protection association said on Jan 11. The species can be traced back 10 million years. There are only about 1,000 of the birds worldwide. \\\\\\'Toilet revolution\\\\\\' comes to Xi\\\\\\'an Xi\\\\\\'an, Shaanxi province - home to the famed Terracotta Warriors - has created \"toilet chiefs\" and a leading group to steer public restroom upgrades. Neighborhood office employees will be tasked with regularly checking facilities, according to the city\\\\\\'s tourism administration. If a restroom at a tourism spot or attraction does not make the grade, the officials responsible for sanitation, including those at the district level, will fail their annual work assessment, according to Zhang Yongke, director of the administration. Ministry: Textbooks should be revised The Ministry of Education urged education departments across the country to revise textbooks for primary and secondary schools by extending the official period of the war from eight to 14 years. In previous textbooks, the Chinese People\\\\\\'s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression lasted for eight years beginning on July 7, 1937, when Japanese troops bombed Lugou Bridge and Wanping county in southwest Beijing; and it ending on Aug 15, 1945, when Japan declared its unconditional surrender. In the revised version, the start of the war would be Sept 18, 1931, when Japanese troops blew up a section of railway in Shenyang, Liaoning province, and attacked the Chinese garrison quartered in the city - marking the beginning of its occupation of China\\\\\\'s northeastern region. Beijing\\\\\\'s subway going full bore Two more new lines will connect with the massive matrix of Beijing subway construction projects in 2017, adding to the 20 projects already in progress, officials announced on Jan 11. Line 28, also known as the CBD Line, will run through eight stations under Beijing\\\\\\'s central business district, as well as the Beijing East Railway Station in Chaoyang district. The Yanfang Branch Line connects Zhoukoudian, the site of the Peking Man Relics Site, to the city-center-bound Yanfang main line, which is expected to open this year. The two new lines are expected to open no later than 2021. Organs to have airline priority Donated organs will have priority when it comes to boarding airplanes at all civil airports in China, according to a regulation released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China on Jan 11. Medical staff transporting donated organs should apply to an airline at least four hours before departure, if possible, the regulation says. If they fail to apply in advance or fail to arrive at an airport on time, airlines should carry out emergency plans and arrange priority passage for them so they can complete security checks and boarding procedures as quickly as possible, it says. New PLA Navy ship unveiled The People\\\\\\'s Liberation Army Navy has commissioned a new reconnaissance ship, a PLA Navy media outlet reported on Jan 11 in a rare move that also made public the composition of the nation\\\\\\'s electronic intelligence fleet. The CNS Kaiyangxing, or Mizar, with hull code 856, was delivered to a combat support flotilla of the North Sea Fleet on Jan 10 in Qingdao, Shandong province, the report by Modern Navy said. The Kaiyangxing is capable of all-weather, round-the-clock reconnaissance on multiple targets, the report said, adding that the ship is so sophisticated that only a few other countries, such as the United States and Russia, are capable of matching it. National tobacco law has positive effect It is estimated that about 10 percent of the population of China - the world\\\\\\'s biggest tobacco consuming country, with more than 300 million smokers - now enjoy legal protection against secondhand smoke as a result of tobacco control regulations, according to a recent report. The report - A Civil Society Perspective on Tobacco Control in China 2016 - was published on Jan 10 by the ThinkTank Research Center for Health Development, one of the country\\\\\\'s most outspoken NGOs committed to tobacco control. To date, only three Chinese cities - Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen - have introduced smoking bans in public places, while some smaller cities have local laws on tobacco control. More ethanol from corn encouraged China will further encourage the use of corn to make ethanol this year as part of an effort to reduce its huge grain stocks. Authorities are also considering adjustments to the floor prices for wheat and rice this year. Xu Shaoshi, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual work conference on grain recently that the commission will allow a moderate increase in corn-based ethanol and expand its use in other areas to help absorb corn stocks. Instead of subsidizing storage facilities, it is better to use the corn, he said. Rankings to aid career prospects A reform of the ranking system for Chinese and foreign professionals, to be launched within three years, is expected to boost the career prospects of millions by removing outdated requirements. Professionals across most industries are currently placed in one of three categories - junior, midlevel or senior - which limits their opportunities for promotion. The reform will see a greater emphasis on ethics, social contributions and innovation, the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council said in a notice. More than 55 million Chinese and foreign professionals will be affected, it said. Guideline issued for disaster relief The central government has issued a guideline on disaster prevention and relief to upgrade the country\\\\\\'s ability to cope with natural disasters. The document, released on Jan 10, said greater efforts should be made to balance the relationship between humans and nature, and to properly handle the relationship between socioeconomic growth and disaster prevention and relief. Efforts aim to prevent spread of avian flu China\\\\\\'s health authority has called for more efforts to prevent and control the spread of the H7N9 avian flu virus. The National Health and Family Planning Commission made the statement on the heels of reports that people had been infected with H7N9 in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. 1,315 firms in Shanxi fined for pollution A total of 1,315 companies have been punished after a three-month campaign in Shanxi province, which has experienced some of the worst smog in China this winter. The campaign started in mid-December, according to the provincial Environmental Protection Department. Fines totaling 21.5 million yuan ($3.1 million; 3 million euros; 2.6 million) have been meted out, and 33 people have been punished. Students detained over muggings Fifteen middle school student were held in criminal detention in Beijing on suspicion of carrying out a series of muggings in early December in the Sanlitun area, a popular commercial district in the capital\\\\\\'s downtown area. Police said the gang operated late at night and targeted multiple victims in the district, which is known for its bars and shopping centers. All of the suspects study at a nearby middle school. The youngest is 13, the police said. Flight delays still a pressing issue The punctuality rate of China\\\\\\'s major airports is still far from satisfactory, according to a recent report published by local aviation statistics company VariFlight.Although the average punctuality rate of the surveyed airports rose 7 percent year-on-year to 70.4 percent in 2016, the average delay was 33 minutes. July saw the lowest punctuality rate of 62.3 percent, with delays during that month averaging 42 minutes.   - Head above water: An archaeologist investigates in Hongmen Reservoir in Fuzhou, Jiangxi province, on Jan 8.

The July 7 Incident in 1937 was the beginning of China\\\\\\'s nationwide full-scale war against the Japanese invasion, but the fight of regional resistance actually began much earlier in 1931.

(China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page12)\\'\\n \\'The world is scrambling to learn English - but that\\\\\\'s not necessarily a good thing for native speakers We used to have a saying in the Anglosphere during the Cold War 70s that optimists learned Russian while pessimists learned Chinese. It was a knowing, if flippant, expression of a contrary view that the Soviet Union was not the West\\\\\\'s biggest challenger. Ultimately China would re-emerge as the dominant world power. That seemed a ludicrously distant proposition at a time when China was emerging from the trials of the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76) and US president Richard Nixon had only just initiated his pivot to Beijing. Then came the start of a four-decade era in China of \"reform and opening -up\", and the rest, as they say, is history.    Soviet power crumbled, the US emerged as the lone superpower and China continued on an economic long march that is seeing it challenge the Americans in the present decade for the title of world\\\\\\'s largest economy. So were all those optimistic Anglophones who learned Russian wasting their time? Are all those pessimists who learned Chinese poised to reap the benefits? The evidence is that most of the Anglosphere learned neither and remained stubbornly monolingual, while the rest of the world was busy learning English. English is now the undisputed language of international exchange. French, which once dominated diplomacy, has played a diminishing role. Around the world English is the lingua franca of millions of non-native speakers. Business deals and treaties are negotiated via the medium of what has become the No 1 world language. That may represent some kind of triumph for the Anglosphere, but it is scarcely a personal victory for individual Americans, Britons or other Anglophones. They are less and less likely to speak another language. An official 2013 British Council report revealed an \"alarming shortage\" of people able to speak the 10 languages vital to the country\\\\\\'s future prosperity and global standing. Mandarin figured prominently at No 4 on the British Council list.    Despite that warning, subsequent evidence shows that language learning has declined further in British schools. A 2015 report said British teachers found attracting pupils to study languages after the age of 16 was a \"challenge\". One small consolation was a \"modest increase\" - from a low base - in the number of schools offering Mandarin, a language \"recognized as crucial to the UK\\\\\\'s long-term competitiveness\". In the US, the situation is even worse. A 2015 survey showed that budget cuts, low enrollments and teacher shortages meant Americans were falling behind the rest of the world. It was revealed that less than 1 percent of American adults were proficient in a foreign language that they studied at school, in an era when one in five American jobs are tied to international trade. Sadly, a largely monolingual Anglosphere can probably continue to thrive in a globalized world despite the dire warnings of the educationalists. Now that everyone else seems to speak English, it may be tempting to ask, \"what\\\\\\'s the problem\". The problem is perhaps that learning a language also means learning a culture and learning a different way of thinking. It can also open up many possibilities that have nothing to do with business deals or international politics - access to culture, literature, personal friendships across borders. It is not too farfetched to theorize that the insularity so recently displayed by voters in Britain and the US might have at least some connection to the language issue. It has never been easier than now to learn a language through a range of online resources, many of them free. They even say it is good for your brain. Studies say bilingualism can delay the onset of dementia. So, as you start out on your New Year\\\\\\'s resolutions, forget the gym membership (you know you won\\\\\\'t last more than a month) and learn a language instead. Haoyun! Good luck!

What\\'s not to like about a cuddly black-and-white bundle of fur that acts up for the camera every time it snows? China has made Herculean efforts to protect what is, to all intents and purposes, a national symbol. And there\\'s good news, too, for all us pandaphiles. The 2014 Chinese census showed there were 1,835 pandas living in the wild in their natural bamboo forest habitat in southwest China - up from the 2004 census, which listed 1,600 wild pandas. And thanks to a 30-year conservation effort by the Chinese authorities, there are now about 300 giant pandas in captivity, most in Chinese conservation areas and zoos but about 50 in zoos worldwide, on loan from China and under strict supervision. With, of course, a steady supply of bamboo.    But what about their distant cousin, the red panda? Actually, scientists now say they are not part of the same genus, although they share the same habitat and love the same food - succulent bamboo stalks. In my book, red pandas are also well up there on the cuteness scale, so let\\'s take a closer look. Smaller than his so-called cousin, the red panda (xiaoxiongmao in Chinese) looks more like a cross between a small cat and a bear, often with red fur and vivid white markings around the eyes and muzzle, as well as a distinctive bushy ringed tail. They are also found in Southwest China, and - like the giant panda - are an endangered species, although the giant panda has recently been upgraded to the lesser level of vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the international body for species protection. But the red panda is also found in parts of Tibet and Nepal. It\\'s a solitary creature that also likes bamboo. Estimates of the wild population are difficult, but experts reckon there are about 10,000 of the little critters out there. The latest statistics show about 800 living happily in captivity. China\\'s conservation efforts also extend to the red panda, with over 40 percent of its natural habitat in the country\\'s southwest classified as protected area. Hunting and trapping are strictly forbidden. So why am I using my column as a pulpit to preach about pandas, red and giant? I think it\\'s because, like many people, I\\'ve become acutely aware recently that for some species, time is running out. No one who has seen a tiger at a zoo can fail to be awed by the sheer power of what is, after all, a very sophisticated killing machine. Yet tigers are under threat.    The Zoological Society of London, with which China Daily has worked closely in the past, is focusing on preserving various species of tigers worldwide. These magnificent beasts are constantly under threat - there are those who still believe its skin, claws, teeth and bones are essential ingredients of traditional Asian medicine. You\\'d better sit down for this factoid. In past decades 95 percent - yes, 95 percent - of the world\\'s tiger population has disappeared. In Indonesia, ZSL is supporting local wildlife rangers to protect the remaining 300 or so Sumatran tigers. There is hope - in 2010, worldwide tiger numbers hit an all-time low of 3,200 animals in the wild. Now, for the first time in more than a century, a global census showed that the number had risen to 3,890 animals. So whether it\\'s a panda, giant or red, or a tiger, or an elephant - in fact anything that makes this planet worth living on - just say yes to conservation. We won\\'t regret it.

In doing so, a more pragmatic view goes beyond the much-hyped macro indicators of gross domestic product and the consumer price index. Most significant throughout 2016 was the number and size of foreign takeovers by Chinese companies. The total value of Chinese mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies reached a record $247.2 billion (234.3 billion euros; 201.5 billion) in 2016. If this figure is not staggering enough, then how about the year-on-year percentage increase, which stands at an amazing 142 percent. Before discussing key deals that took place last year and then looking ahead at what to expect throughout 2017, the changing nature of these takeovers needs highlighting.   Takeovers involving raw material purchases and other supplies that are needed to fuel factory production now represent a far smaller percentage of Chinese acquisition activity. The focus now is much more on consumer branding and the technological know-how needed to fuel domestic consumption. It is now estimated that this new approach, set to continue as China\\\\\\'s economy continues its transition from low-cost production and exporting to domestic consumption of premium brands, accounts for approximately 50 percent of all Chinese company takeovers of foreign brands. Last year also highlighted major change in a variety of industries now targeted by Chinese companies in their foreign firm acquisition strategies. Even more significantly, last year witnessed the further emergence of privately owned Chinese companies planting a firm footprint on the international M&A scene. Going back only as far as 2013, Chinese takeover deals were heavily dominated by the state-owned sector, which typically went on the hunt for copper mines in Africa, iron ore producers in Australia and major players in the Canadian energy sector.  Europe is now very much the focus of increasingly ambitious and entrepreneurial privately- owned Chinese enterprises, with recent acquisitions of French fashion houses, Italian football teams and UK luxury brands. From finance to food and fashion to football, the increasing variety of industries targeted has been more than matched by the increasing amounts invested in huge takeovers of foreign companies and their branded products by Chinese companies. Last year saw the largest takeover to date by a Chinese company of a foreign firm. In August, Chinese chemical giant ChemChina secured the acquisition of Swiss pesticide and seed producer Syngenta for a formidable 43 billion ($53 billion; 50 billion euros). The European focus for Chinese takeover targets last year also saw Tencent, part of the increasingly dominant Chinese internet sector, splash out almost $9 billion in July on Finnish mobile game development company Supercell, easily Tencent\\\\\\'s largest foreign takeover so far. Acquisitions by Chinese firms across Europe last year totaled a whopping $76.5 billion, comfortably the largest merger and acquisition investment sum compared with the Americas and Asia. Companies from Western Europe, and Germany in particular, appear to stand out as the favored targets for takeover. Further examination of Chinese company merger and acquisition activity last year reveals a far more mature, professional approach in which takeover targets were screened with the utmost scrutiny before the launch of any takeover bid. Takeovers are also seen increasingly as partner brands - where considerable care is taken in post-acquisition integration. They are not simply public trophies. But will this Chinese company-led and European-focused M&A spree continue throughout 2017? In short, the answer is not only a resounding \"yes\", but even greater growth could take place. Here are some of the reasons behind what could be another record year for Chinese company takeovers: US President Trump. Despite huge uncertainty over the soon-to-be appointed president, it is clear that the US economy could become far less open for business with the outside world - Asia and China in particular. This could leave Europe, already the clearly favored target for overseas expansion by Chinese companies, an even more attractive place. Europe\\\\\\'s attractiveness is further enhanced when the likely industry targets for Chinese companies are considered. Top among the most high-profile takeovers last year are fashion, football, finance and technology, and major Western European economies offer a rich supply of established global brands in each of these areas. For example, Europe boasts three of the four widely recognized fashion capitals in the world: London, Paris and Milan. Consequentially many of the top global fashion brands are European. Chinese investment in football clubs really took off last year. For example, Chinese consumer electronics retailer Suning bought a majority stake in Italian football giant Inter Milan in June last year for $307 million, and one of the biggest English football clubs, Aston Villa, also became Chinese owned. Further forays into the most-developed football leagues around the world is highly likely, and once again European football dominates. The English Premier League, the German Bundesliga and the French Ligue1, as well as the Italian Serie A and the Spanish La Liga, contain many of the most highly valued football clubs in the world. Europe\\\\\\'s financial sector will also continue to prove attractive to potential Chinese investors. Takeovers in Europe\\\\\\'s ailing banking sector are seen as far less politically sensitive than the US banking industry. Global technology brands, much-coveted by Chinese industry as a vital aid in their modernization efforts, can also be found in abundance across Europe. This goes some way to explaining the attractiveness of German industries as potential takeover targets. German companies and the German government continue to welcome investment from China, and Chinese companies appreciate just how much the adoption of the most advanced technologies in their industry will improve their competitiveness. Of course there are concerns that too much outbound investment may lead to government attempts to curb activities in order to protect the currency. But such concerns do not stand up to scrutiny. Further transition toward the adoption across Chinese industry of a high-investment, high-quality and premium branding business culture will not happen if any kind of currency reliance continues. It is, therefore, unlikely that currency concerns will lead to a limitation of overseas involvement by Chinese companies - especially in acquisition activity. So what should European businesses make of this inexorable influx of takeovers by Chinese companies and how might they actually benefit? Crucial for European business has been the changing approach toward takeover targets by Chinese firms and the post-acquisition process. In both case, partnerships and a long-term perspective appear to have usurped the previously overeager, short-term acquisitive attitude of Chinese companies. Chinese companies and their leaders are no longer trophy hunting when it comes to takeovers of European businesses and their brands. Instead, they increasingly see growth via foreign brand acquisition as part of a clear, sustainable growth strategy, where long-term market share and customer satisfaction trump without trouble any short-term financial objectives. Chinese companies, while keen to learn from their European takeover targets, also appear to accept that established global brands should be left as individual product brands with no or little public association between the brand and its new corporate owner. During 2017 and beyond, therefore, European brands could benefit substantially from Chinese corporate takeover investment, which - if last year\\\\\\'s M&A activities are indicative of future activity - should be seen as much-needed fuel for brand building.

At the end of rehearsals, Wu Jiatong, CEO of Wu Promotion, the private promoter in China that organized the 2016 tour, stepped onto the stage with cake and flowers, wishing Hong a happy birthday and congratulating the orchestra. \"I totally forgot my birthday,\" Hong recalls. \"When Wu walked to me, I thought he was going to give a short speech. I was really surprised.\"   From Left: Musicians from Chinese Traditional Orchestra of the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater, and Swiss audience, at the Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne in Switzerland.

Photos Provided to China Daily   What made Hong even more excited was that the KKL - or Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne - was the same venue where the late conductor Claudio Abbado (1933-2014) gave his final concerts. \"Abbado was one of my favorite conductors in the world, and I was honored to perform there,\" says Hong, a 1982 graduate of Shenyang Conservatory of Music. The concert turned out to be a great success, with a full house of more than 2,000 giving the orchestra a lengthy ovation. On Jan 27, Hong will lead the musicians in a performance at the KKL, again as part of a new European tour, which will kick off on Jan 16 in Budapest, Hungary. After KKL, they will travel to Erl, Austria, on Jan 29. \"I thought the main audience for a traditional Chinese folk music concert would be overseas Chinese. I didn\\\\\\'t expect that the majority of the audience would be Westerners,\" she says. \"Their warm feedback was very encouraging, and we are looking forward to our upcoming shows.\" The 2017 program will feature well-known music pieces, including The Great Wall Capriccio (Erhu Concerto) by Chinese composer Liu Wenjin (1937-2013), and Lingering Snow on The Broken Bridge, composed by Liu Xijin, in which a solo flutist performs with the folk orchestra. The orchestra is one of four national Chinese folk music orchestras that will tour abroad during the upcoming Chinese Spring Festival period, with the support of Wu Promotion. Titled the Grand Chinese New Year Concert, the tour will involve more than 300 Chinese musicians from the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater, the Guangdong National Orchestra of China, the Zhejiang Traditional Orchestra and the Shaanxi Broadcasting Chinese Orchestra. They will visit 27 cities in 14 countries, including Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Finland and the United Kingdom. According to Wu, each performance will open with an introduction showing the uniqueness of traditional Chinese instruments. The idea is to enable Western audiences to better understand the music. \"The Grand Chinese New Year Concert is our oldest brand. It will celebrate its 20th anniversary next year,\" says Wu, who founded Wu Promotion with his father in 1991. The company currently produces more than 500 concerts and events annually in China and abroad. The company recently wrapped up a Cuba tour by the China Philharmonic Orchestra, which featured performances on Dec 15 and 16. Besides the Grand Chinese New Year Concert, one of the best-known projects is the annual Peking Opera Festival, which celebrated its eighth year in the Darwin Entertainment Centre, Australia, from Nov 29 to Dec 1. Wu recalls the first concert in the Vienna Musikverein in 1998 with the orchestra under the baton of conductor Chen Xieyang. \"Tickets sold out, and even the stairs in the venue were occupied by audience members. That was an unexpected success. Since then, we\\\\\\'ve made the Grand Chinese New Year Concert an annual event to display our traditional folk music to foreign audiences,\" says Wu, who was born in Beijing and pursued his music studies in Austria. So far, the grand concert has attracted about 300,000 concertgoers in some 20 countries. Presenting music with such instruments as the horse-headed fiddle from Inner Mongolia, as well as Cantonese melodies from the gaohu (a string instrument played with a bow), 13 Chinese folk music orchestras have performed as part of the project. The tour has stopped in Switzerland most frequently. In 2006, Wu Promotion brought China Traditional Orchestra Zhejiang to perform at the KKL in Lucerne under the baton of conductor Zhang Guoyong. It also visited five German cities and then went to Vienna, Amsterdam, Alexandria and Cairo. Wu says Swiss Television provided six hours of coverage for the event, including broadcasting the concert and presenting documentaries about traditional Chinese musicians and their instruments. More than 2,000 people saw the show in person, and even more were exposed via television to the great variety of sounds and musical instruments less known in the Western world. Since then, Wu Promotion has brought many Chinese orchestras and art troupes to perform in Switzerland. The company has also brought Swiss art troupes to China, including the Grand Theatre de Geneve Ballet Company, which toured China in April Wu Promotion has a three-year plan to bring the established Lucerne Festival to Shanghai from 2018 to 2020. The festival is a summer music event held annually in Switzerland. Founded in 1938, it is known for presenting famous orchestras, legendary conductors and celebrated soloists. During the 7th Peking Opera Festival, which was held in Geneva, Switzerland, last year, the president of Grand Theater de Geneva, Tobias Richter, discussed with Wu the idea of moving Opera des Nations to China after June 2018. Grand Theater de Geneva, built in 1876, is the largest opera house in the French-speaking area of Switzerland. Due to renovations that have been in progress for more than two years, a large wood-construction theater was purchased from France for temporary use. The temporary theater, which served as a venue for La Comedie-Francaise during its own renovation, was resettled in Geneva. The structure was expanded and revived under the name of Opera de Nations. The city of Geneva has agreed to gift the structure to China as a token of friendship in the long history of close ties between China and Geneva. \"This will be a historic event for both China and Switzerland, and it will serve as a cultural bond between the two countries,\" says Wu. \"I fully support this transfer of the Theatre des Nations from Geneva to Beijing, two cities already linked by a thriving partnership. It would represent one more excellent opportunity to increase and further deepen the relations between our two countries,\" says Jean-Jacques de Dardel, Swiss ambassador to China. \"This gift from Switzerland to China will allow many Swiss artists, musicians, orchestras, and dancers to perform for the Chinese public and strengthen the cultural ties between our two people in a structure representing the best in sustainable building methods. The fact that this theater could be rebuilt in Beijing, the capital city, is also a symbolic gesture illustrating the long lasting Sino-Swiss political relations.\" chennan@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page5)\\'\\n \\'President Xi Jinping will be giving a \"strong boost\" to relations between China and Switzerland, which already enjoy considerable mutual trust, says Didier Burkhalter, head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland. \"I am confident that President Xi\\\\\\'s state visit will be giving a strong boost to our relationship, which is already very good and promising,\" Burkhalter tells China Daily. Xi is to visit Switzerland from January 15-18 to deepen the relationship by announcing new measures to boost free trade, cultural exchanges, tourism and financial cooperation. Switzerland was the first Western nation to recognize the People\\\\\\'s Republic of China in January 1950. \"And from that time, our relationship, which is a historic one, has become stronger and stronger with the mutual trust we have rendered,\" he says. Switzerland recognized China\\\\\\'s market economy status in 2007. In July 2014, the two countries started to implement a free trade agreement and in April 2016, when former president of the Swiss Confederation Johann N. Schneider-Ammann visited China, both sides signed a \"partnership of innovation.\"    Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard took over from Schneider-Ammann as president of the Swiss Confederation from the beginning of this year. Leuthard also visited China in August last year. Burkhalter says currently both sides enjoy a \"very good and promising relationship\" with dialogue in various areas such as the economy, finance, environment, culture and human rights. He also says China and Switzerland have set examples on how to establish a win-win partnership by ironing out differences in their political and social systems. \"The Swiss side is willing to deepen cooperation with China to explore innovation and maintain the global free trade system,\" says Burkhalter. Burkhalter adds that his country will also work closely with China in various multilateral areas to become stabilizing factors of the increasingly complex global situation. fujing@chinadaily.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page2)\\'\\n \\'Responsible business leaders need to create environments where ideas can connect and people can collaborate We see a lot in the media currently about division - between people, between nations, between ideologies. And it\\\\\\'s true, the world is moving in new, and sometimes unexpected, directions, and the existing order is being disrupted. But we must remember that the exchange of ideas can be a uniting force. Most of the world\\\\\\'s real innovations come not from individuals laboring away in isolation, or even from \"eureka\" moments, but from working together. The theme of this year\\\\\\'s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, \"Responsible and Responsive Leadership\" highlights the vital role collaboration must play for us to best navigate the future. This year, British Telecommunications Plc will celebrate 180 years since the filing of the first patent for the five-needle electric telegraph - an innovation that laid the earliest foundations for today\\\\\\'s connected world and which underpins the fourth industrial revolution. The inventors of that device, Charles Wheatstone (a scientist) and William Fothergill Cooke (an entrepreneur) worked together to turn a great idea into what eventually became a global industry.  If I think about innovations from BT\\\\\\'s history, almost all were collaborative efforts. From the first live TV transmission across the Atlantic - a collaboration between AT&T\\\\\\'s Bell Labs and BT Labs - to the work we\\\\\\'re doing today on the next generation of ultrafast broadband technologies, the biggest successes have resulted from experts in different fields working together to achieve a common goal. That\\\\\\'s why companies today are increasingly taking a global \"open innovation\" approach. A major risk for large organizations, even ones such as ours who invest extensively in R&D is the \"not invented here\" syndrome - the chance that disruptive technologies will be ignored because they\\\\\\'re not pioneered in your own labs. BT\\\\\\'s innovation scouting teams and university partnerships in the UK, Silicon Valley, the MIT tech cluster, Abu Dhabi, China and other strategic locations around the world give us a global view, bringing the most innovative technologies into our business, wherever they originate. Collaboration between business and academia is a key component of \"open innovation\". As we\\\\\\'re gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, let\\\\\\'s take a Swiss example of collaboration - CERN, with its 2,500 staff from 22 member states. The birthplace of the World Wide Web, CERN provides a global community of scientists with access to powerful facilities for experimentation, research, data processing and analysis. In 2013, the combination of these great minds and world-leading facilities in tunnels not far from Davos proved the existence of the Higgs boson, or \"God particle\", a fundamental building block of the universe. There\\\\\\'s a significant contingent of British brains involved in CERN. Britain is a melting pot of science and industry and, in a post-Brexit world, the UK will need to capitalize on its world-leading universities and build an innovation-led economy that lays a powerful foundation for future growth. Helping universities to focus their research and enormous intellectual capital on areas that have the potential for the creation of world-leading intellectual property is a role that businesses like ours increasingly need to step up to. Sustainable future growth needs purposeful innovation that is socially and commercially relevant. At a global level we see how things like the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement need to apply a collaborative and open approach to transcend national and political boundaries and develop innovative solutions to the big global issues of our time - extreme poverty, inequality and climate change. And every day we see examples of the collective power of people using social media. When used responsibly, this can be a force for good, supporting people in need and improving the state of the world. The first social media platforms were born of a few creative and collaborative minds less than a decade ago. They have since been adopted by billions of people and continue to evolve in their form and function. In 2016, Major Tim Peake, Britain\\\\\\'s first astronaut, used social media to bring the enormity of space closer to millions of schoolchildren in the UK and around the world. The International Space Station, which he visited, is one of the most ambitious international collaborations ever attempted and the most politically complex space exploration program ever undertaken. The largest space station ever constructed, it continues to be assembled in orbit and to date has been visited by astronauts of nearly 20 nationalities who make use of its research laboratories to improve our understanding of the world around us. So whether we look to the inky blackness of the sky or somewhere closer to home, we see time and again the power of the exchange of ideas and of working together across boundaries. Chance favors the connected mind; fortune favors the brave. In our modern world, responsive and responsible business leaders need to create environments where ideas can connect and people can collaborate. The author is the Chief Executive of BT Group.

He will make clear the world\\\\\\'s second-largest economy\\\\\\'s commitment to being a key driver of world trade. The theme of the forum, which runs from Jan 17 to 20, is \"Responsive and Responsible Leadership\". Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the Geneva-based international organization, welcomed China\\\\\\'s involvement.    \"China is an emerging superpower, and we expect the country to play an increasingly active role as a responsive and responsible global leader,\" he says. \"Areas where we are already seeing this happen include catalyzing support for protecting the environment, acting as a champion for international trade and investment, supporting development and infrastructure finance and moving to develop and expand the global digital economy.\" Despite increasing fears of protectionism, economic ties can continue to flourish between industrializing Asia and developed Europe. On China\\\\\\'s part, everyone agrees that some big challenges remain - Trump provocations (or political distractions), domestic debt, or capital outflow to court potentially high returns from the overseas (mainly American) markets. The Central Economic Work Conference, held in Beijing in mid-December, was used to deal with exactly these challenges. China\\\\\\'s top-level decision-makers hold such a conference each December to map out development strategies and targets for the next year. Key targets will not be revealed until they are proposed to the National People\\\\\\'s Congress in early March, when targets become official.    But enough information can be obtained by China business watchers from the communique of the Central Economic Work Conference, which is in effect a carefully-worded statement of all major strategies for the next year. Some overseas commentators said what they read from the communique was a general approach of putting stability first and reform second, leaving the impression that Beijing will never muster enough resolve, even though its leaders have made great strides in building a more solid power base through an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign over the past few years. China has to take necessary precautions in reform. A lot of time is needed because it is a completely different game for local officials, who began their careers when GDP, and almost nothing else, served as the measure of their performance. In 2017, stability is still important, if not even more so now that a change in the US administration and its possible China policy are bringing in an additional sense of uncertainty. But stability doesn\\\\\\'t mean a standstill or no change. Reform won\\\\\\'t stop, even if it can\\\\\\'t proceed by leaps and bounds as it did in earlier days, such as when the special economic zones were just being launched in the 1980s. That was a time when China\\\\\\'s per capita GDP was only around $300. Now, it is $8,200. What is in the nation\\\\\\'s best interest is to progress with reform amid stability. Stability is guarantee for reform. The ongoing clean-government movement requires more than frequent reports and checks on officials\\\\\\' conduct in office and with public funds. They are also expected to carry out more economic tasks than just enlarging the local GDP. In the nation\\\\\\'s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), rigorous targets are set for social development and environmental protection. Some economic targets do not even require growth in numbers. One example is the task, assigned two years ago and yet to be completed, to slash industrial capacity - most noticeably the closure of some steel mills. It is aimed at helping the world\\\\\\'s steelmakers and reducing pollution. As serious readers will realize, the communique said, 2017 will be a more demanding year for reform. Cutting excessive industrial capacity, inventory, borrowing, operational costs and whatever shortcomings exist in management and production is a task to be continued from 2016. New tasks abound. One area to watch is reform of the public-private partnership scheme, sometimes called the mixed-ownership scheme, in state-owned enterprises. It is something that China has been talking about for the last few years but, since being included in the top leaders\\\\\\' 60-point decision on reform in 2013, it has been put into practice in only a small number of pilot projects, as with all reform programs in their initial stage. There were rumors that an overall PPP program was being drawn up for some national-level large SOEs. But, as the Chinese like to say, conditions were still not quite right for introducing PPP nationwide. By contrast, in 2017, according to the communique, some \"concrete steps\" will be taken in industries ranging from power generation and grid, oil and gas, railways, airlines, telecommunications and defense systems. Although accomplishment of the whole PPP program is likely to take a few years, once implemented it will amount to a second remaking of the Chinese SOE system, after its first major reform in the early 1990s, overseen by the premier Zhu Rongji. Even amid the bold changes of Zhu\\\\\\'s time, having private investment in defense companies was beyond anyone\\\\\\'s imagination. Apart from the above-mentioned changes, progress is planned in many areas. In general, it features two things. One is the domestic and the other the legal side of economic reform, especially protection of the property rights of companies and private citizens. Thanks to all the efforts since the 2008 global crisis to maintain stability while seeking development, China has developed a more balanced economic system. Its focus has grown from chasing ever-faster growth to building a lasting institution. The Central Economic Work Conference also pledged new efforts, including: In agricultural reforms, to focus on the definition and protection of land rights; In industrial reforms, to focus on boosting innovation and helping small and medium-sized enterprises; In the real estate market, to restrict speculative investment in urban residential housing units; In the regional development strategy, to focus on the country\\\\\\'s existing key urban belts; In the economic legal system, to strengthen the protection of property rights and redress wrong court rulings in this regard; In the financial system, to clarify fiscal interests and responsibilities between the central and local governments, while making regulation more effective in the financial market. Of course, the Central Economic Work Conference has painted a far-from-detailed picture of business in China in 2017. It is a framework, in which policies and the methods of their implementation can be adjusted according to conditions and possibilities. But the framework is expected to remain stable. It is especially important when, in all likelihood, China\\\\\\'s international environment will deteriorate if the Trump administration acts as its boss repeatedly pledged during his election campaign. As some observers say, what the world will see from the Trump administration will not be a simple version of isolationism, but unilateralism. Other economies, as a result, may feel pressured to take initiatives by themselves instead of counting on the US market. More than ever before, China will have to depend on its own economy for growth. But just as Marcus Aurelius said, time is everyone\\\\\\'s equal possession. While Trump plays his own unilateral game, other countries can also develop their games. Four years is not a short time, as long as there isn\\\\\\'t a major disaster. It is enough for China to make changes, and come out stronger as a more resourceful business partner for all countries in the world.

His legion of Chinese fans can hardly wait. \"I really don\\\\\\'t know how long he can play, but I hope he can at least finish the 2017 season, because a five-month wait is quite long for us,\" says Lin Shengjie, a diehard fan of the 17-time singles Grand Slam champion from Switzerland. To fully recover from surgery on his left knee, Federer withdrew from the 2016 season after Wimbledon, taking five months off for the first time in his 20-year career. Lin, 26, is among his countless avid fans who turn almost every tournament he plays in China into a home-court event - cheering hard between points in matches, and gathering at his hotel lobby and practice court for autographs and adulation. Federer hasn\\\\\\'t opened a personal account on social media in China, but fans have voluntarily set up multiple online communities to share updates and to organize offline interactions with him once he makes himself available. What they ask in return is quite simple. \"I personally don\\\\\\'t mind if he gets another Grand Slam or not. Just watching him play is an enormous pleasure,\" Lin says.    Zhang Bendou, a veteran tennis writer at Titan Sports in China, attributes Federer\\\\\\'s undisputed recognizability in China to the fact that his career upswing coincided with the general ascent of professional tennis in the country since the early 2000s. \"He is popular worldwide, but the Chinese market is of special significance for him. He is a superstar who ascended to career prime during the period when the game began to be promoted and appreciated here,\" says Zhang, who has followed professional tennis for more than a decade. \"Lots of fans here fell in love with the game watching him. That\\\\\\'s a concrete emotional tie.\" Lin, who ran an online community for Federer fans from 2007 to 2009, agrees. \"Federer was the best player when tennis was growing dramatically in China,\" she says. \"The past decade saw a boom in the tennis market here. Federer was always at the top. Good timing,\" she says. Since first playing in China at the 2002 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, the year-end championship at the time, Federer has come to play in China 11 times, including in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His flawless skills, elegant style and decent public image off the court soon captured the hearts of Chinese fans. Although not seen as an Olympic powerhouse, the Swiss athletes received boisterous cheers from the stands at the 2008 opening ceremony, mainly for Federer carrying the Swiss flag. \"Effortless yet deadly shots and smooth footwork - his tennis is beautiful to watch. You can\\\\\\'t stay immune. You have to admire his game,\" Zhang says. As the darling of fans worldwide, Federer never hesitates to express his gratitude for the support from Chinese fans. \"It\\\\\\'s great energy, I must say. It gives me unbelievable motivation. It inspires me to train hard and push further for that particular day, but also wanting to come back again next year, and again and again,\" the 35-year-old said during the 2013 Shanghai Masters. Along with Federer, fellow countrywoman Martina Hingis ranks among the best-known Swiss in China - also for accomplishments in tennis. Building her name on the pro tour ahead of Federer in the 1990s, Hingis still enjoys enduring popularity in China, as demonstrated by her appearance in Beijing to play doubles at the 2016 China Open. From the first-round of the Premier Mandatory women\\\\\\'s event, Hingis\\\\\\' game with partner Coco Vandeweghe, who is virtually unknown in China, was celebrated by boisterous Chinese fans who chanted her name while holding posters adorned with her Chinese nickname \"Swiss princess\". \"I am already in the Hall of Fame, and I\\\\\\'m still playing in different tournaments, so they still have some memories of me playing, even if it was 10 or 15 years ago. It shows an awareness of the history of the game,\" says the 36-year-old, who has won five Grand Slam singles and 12 doubles titles since 1997. sunxiaochen@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page3)\\'\\n \\'But when you are the Dalai Lama, the deepest lines on your 81-year-old skin are laugh lines. His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone, largely because of his sense of humor. It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life. When he presided over the Emory-Tibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod, India, he showed his teasing nature right away. Gathered were thousands of saffron-robed nuns and monks, world-renowned scientists, Tibetans and many interested followers, eager learn how to \"bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment.\" The crowd looked as serious as the topic. As they waited in the temple, they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats. Finally, the low moan of a guttural chant began, and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter. When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door, the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded. Some prostrated themselves on the ground. His Holiness walked in slowly, surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress. Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps. At the bottom, the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy, laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor. \"When you smile, I notice everyone around you smiles. I notice it is very contagious as well,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN\\\\\\'s Chief Medical correspondent, in an interview with His Holiness after the event. \"Basically, we are social animal,\" the Dalai Lama replied. \"We need friend. In order to develop genuine friendship, trust is very important. For trust, if you show them genuine sort of respect, genuine love, then trust come, so here I think the expression of genuine warm feeling smile I think part of that, that\\\\\\'s genuine smile.\" But it is clear that joking around is also key to winning over a crowd. At the event, the Dalai Lama finally sat in his floral chair, against what looked like a pillow one of the monks must have grabbed from his bed, hoping to make him more comfortable. The crowd quieted, leaning forward to hear what His Holiness had to say. But instead of a prayer or a gentle word of wisdom, he decided it was the perfect time to wipe his brow. He took his time and then, rather than putting the white washcloth on the table next to him, he immediately put it on his head, where it rested like an absurd floppy hat. Giggling, he wore it through first part of the meeting, for about an hour. Then, he reached with some ceremony for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him. \"This is not decoration,\" he joked, holding it up. He pointed to himself -- \"eat\" -- and promptly unwrapped the gold foil to pop a hard candy into his mouth. His impish behavior, laughing and joking did the trick. The solemn and respectful crowd began laughing with him, warming up immediately. Everyone seemed ready to listen to a discussion of heavy topics such as \"What are the fundamental constituents of the universe, and how did it originate?\" and \"How is knowledge established and what constitutes valid reasoning?\" When Gupta later asked His Holiness about why he decided to wear the washcloth so comically, the Dalai Lama admitted it was, in part, because he is practical and gets hot. But he also hinted that there was something deeper: It\\\\\\'s important for leaders, particularly spiritual leaders, to \"act like a human being\" and to be playful. Often, \"everyone too much formal,\" he said, \"That is self-torture.\" And though he knows he must respect those leaders, despite \"no word, no movement\" from them, he has sometimes developed \"a strange thinking\" and often hopes something unexpected will happen to make that leader act more \"like a human being.\" \"I had this experience (in) 1954 when I was in Peking,\" His Holiness said. \"Some Indian ambassador, he call on me, come to my room, then as usual, some Chinese foreign ministries officials come. \"Everyone too much formal like that,\" he said then mimed being stiff. \"Then somehow they brought some fruit, somehow dumped over, and then everyone acted like a human being,\" he said, laughing and miming people scrambling around, as he saw them do around on the floor. His Holiness suggests everyone let themselves be playful and find the funny in life. In his book \"My Spiritual Journey,\" he calls himself a \"professional laugher\" and writes that he comes from a cheerful family that is always \"amusing ourselves, teasing each other, joking. It\\\\\\'s our habit.\" A quick laugh and an ability to see humor in daily situations and to be playful have been shown to help adults lower stress levels, both for themselves and for those around them, studies show. By being playful and using humor, people also become more observant and more empathetic. They are often bored less, they learn more, they have more friends, and studies show that people who are willing to let out their playful side tend to have a better sense of all-around well-being.  His Holiness believes that no matter how difficult your life may be, this approach will bring you something much deeper. \"Thinking only of the negative aspect doesn\\\\\\'t help to find solutions and it destroys peace of mind,\" he writes. \"I love smiles, and my wish is to see more smiles, real smiles. ... If we want those smiles, we must create the reasons that make them appear.\"\\'\\n \\'Business links between China and Switzerland are expected to be further enriched by a bilateral free trade agreement and investment in sophisticated service businesses and high-tech manufacturing over the next decade, say officials and business leaders from both sides. Shen Danyang, spokesman for China\\\\\\'s Ministry of Commerce, says that even though both the Chinese and Swiss economies have been affected by the global economic downturn, the degree of interdependence between the two remains stable in bilateral trade. Eager to enhance their earning abilities, China and Switzerland signed one of the highest-level and most comprehensive free trade agreements in July 2014, covering environmental issues, employment matters and intellectual property protection. Since the implementation of the China-Switzerland FTA, the volume of bilateral trade has turned around from dropping 27 percent year-on-year in 2014 to 1.7 percent growth to reach $44.26 billion (41.7 billion euros; 36.42) in 2015, data from the General Administration of Customs show. China mainly ships electrical equipment, metal products, furniture, organic chemicals and garments to Switzerland. Watches, industrial instruments and parts, medicine and healthcare products are the main products Switzerland exports to China.    \"Both sides are currently working on the next stage of the agreement,\" says Shen. \"The China-Switzerland FTA will exert a more positive influence on the promotion of trade and investment promotion and benefit more companies in the two countries.\" China\\\\\\'s exports to Switzerland in particular, maintained a favorable momentum in the first half of this year, while bilateral trade volume amounted to 100.25 billion yuan ($14.42 billion). China\\\\\\'s exports to Switzerland also reached 9.85 billion yuan, up 5.6 percent on a year-on-year basis during the six-month period. \"China will continue to export consumer goods in exchange for Switzerland\\\\\\'s high-tech products such as electronic goods, industrial parts and medical equipment. Most of the imports are complementary. Therefore, it isn\\\\\\'t direct competition,\" says Lin Shunjie, director-general of department of trade and investment promotion at the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Sonova Group, the world\\\\\\'s largest hearing-care services provider by revenue, plans to enter more lower-tier Chinese cities and introduce its first 24-hour rechargeable hearing aid-the Phonak Audeo B-R-in China in 2017, as well as bringing its latest hearing aids for children and adults with severe hearing loss to the country in the future. \"Switzerland has always been viewed by Chinese consumers and the government as a country that develops high-tech products. Sonova has been investing in China for more than 10 years and we will continue to expand as we have in the past,\" says Albert Lim, senior vice-president of Sonova for the APAC region. \"Our latest project in China is an audiology training academy for the whole Asia-Pacific region. It has been established in our industrial campus in Suzhou,\" says Lim. The academy\\\\\\'s goal is to develop certified professional courses to continually upgrade and expand the skills of industry professionals. \"Capable Chinese companies are also inclined to acquire Swiss companies to gain cutting-edge technology, especially in chemistry, agricultural products, biology and precision instruments,\" says He Jingtong, a professor of international trade at Nankai University in Tianjin. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page4)\\'\\n \"Companies should improve competitiveness and branding to reduce reliance on expensive overseas brands China\\'s economy has entered a new normal of slower economic growth, and it\\'s encountering some challenges, including relatively low competitiveness of Chinese companies and overcapacity in some industrial sectors. The world economy, led by developed countries, has entered its own new normal phase in which it\\'s difficult even for developed economies to recover. This has had an impact on China\\'s exports. Protectionism is edging back into some countries, as multilateral cooperation - as envisioned by the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example - is replaced with a more closed pattern of bilateral trade and investment mechanisms. To adapt to these new realities, the key for China is to revitalize its existing assets and make the best use of profitable incremental assets. The way forward includes the following: First, China needs more high-quality talent to replace low-cost labor Second, adopt a strategy of globalization as a primary driver of economic growth, replacing the old way of bringing in foreign investment Third, increase the efficiency of resource allocation, replacing the old model of using policy tools to support companies through price supports and tax subsidies. In this way, China could use the mechanisms of fair competition in the market to push Chinese companies to improve their own competitiveness and branding, which would naturally reduce their cost of buying overseas brands and technology at high prices, and could also effectively solve related problems. To realize that, the key is to deepen the supply-side structural reform in China. This includes six aspects: First, streamline administration and delegate power to lower levels, and mobilize the vitality of market players. When the market fails to function well, government should improve regulations and systems to ensure fair competition in the market and deal with fluctuations. Second, vigorously push forward the reform of state-owned enterprises to create an environment that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. SOEs should say goodbye to the environment in which they could depend on low-cost labor, the spillover effect brought by foreign investment, price subsidies and the special competitive status the government has given them. Third, speed up the reform of China\\'s fiscal and tax system, changing resource allocation, which feeds less into the real economy than into other sectors, such as finance. The government should consider coming up with property tax with the right timing, adjust tax rates of transactions involving financial assets, etc. For emerging companies and companies that are environmentally friendly, taxes could be reduced. Fourth, speed up the reform of China\\'s financial system and banking system, to increase banks\\' and financial institutions\\' ability to serve the real economy, and to increase the ability to prevent financial crises. Fifth, make more contributions toward improving people\\'s livelihoods, especially in the reform of the pension system, the healthcare system and the fair allocation of education resources. Sixth, during the structural reform, China needs to ensure that policies are compatible with reality and flexible in case they bring on unintended consequences. This requires China to have a good understanding of the complicated economic situation, both in China and globally. Industrial policies should avoid having all companies invest in the same industry or sector. Companies should have the flexibility to set a course in line with future economic development. At the micro level, market regulation should be loosened, while enhancing supervision, to create a market environment in which the fittest survive. Policies should also be targeted to improve investment in the markets and strengthen consumers\\' willingness to spend. China needs to have accurate industrial policies that encourage innovation and improve people\\'s livelihoods, and also flexible policies that push forward the transformation and upgrading of companies. It needs carry out every reform policy in every link of supply-side reform, which is key to the quality and sustainability of the country\\'s future economic development. Moreover, it should also be prepared for negative influences brought by black swan events that may take place in the world.

Clearly last year was a bruising year,\" he says.   - Rana Mitter, director of the Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre, says President Xi Jinping\\\\\\'s attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year could signal that the global order does not need to change, despite Donald Trump assuming office on Jan 20. Nick J.B. Moore / For China Daily  \"If you think of all the things that Davos stands for, it is about the maintenance of the liberal economic order and, broadly speaking, a quite progressive sort of social system too.\" President Xi\\\\\\'s decision to be at this year\\\\\\'s summit comes after the attendance of Vice-President Li Yuanchao last year and Premier Li Keqiang in 2015. China has also held its own Summer Davos annually since 2007, under the auspices of the WEF, alternating between host cities Tianjin and Dalian. Mitter, who was speaking in the front room of his Oxford home, believes that, given China\\\\\\'s engagement with Davos, Xi\\\\\\'s keynote address to the forum is likely to carry extra significance. The Chinese president is set to reaffirm his commitment to globalization and free trade at the meeting. \"I think a lot of people will be listening very carefully to what he has to say. It is likely to make more of a splash this year than it would have done a year ago. The world 12 months ago was really very different in terms of what was happening and any likely expectations.\" Davos has come to symbolize the global elite, bringing together politicians, heads of think tanks and large corporations, leading economists, academics and the media. It is this elite that has come under fire from populist movements that have led to the election of Donald Trump in the US and the UK\\\\\\'s Brexit decision. Mitter, 47 and regarded as one of the leading China experts in the West, believes voters should not fool themselves into thinking they are being offered anything other than a different form of elite.    \"What is mostly happening is that one elite is being replaced by another. Donald Trump has articulated the voices of many people who are clearly desperately unhappy with their current economic situation but it is not as if he, himself, is a horny-handed son of toil who has worked his way up through the coal mines.\" \"An awful lot of the anti-elites, who are themselves elites of a different sort, are offering supposed solutions that have very little substance to them whatsoever.\" One of the main discussion points at Davos is the risk of returning to a 1930s-style era of protectionism. President-elect Trump threatened during his election campaign to impose a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods \"This strikes me as highly unlikely in practice,\" says Mitter. \"China, famously, and the US are in the World Trade Organization, which exists precisely to try and prevent this sort of trade war escalating. The idea that the US and China can simply launch a trade war against each other without outside intervention does not reflect the reality of the situation.\" \"There are an awful lot of other actors who would have something to say about this, including the European Union, Canada, Australia and the UK, once it leaves the EU of course.\" Climate change is also likely to be high on the agenda at Davos, with the hard-won agreement drawn up at the 2015 Paris summit, which both China and the US ratified, seemingly under threat from the new US administration. \"He hasn\\\\\\'t actually said he will abandon it. Like many other things, when you peruse the grammar very carefully, he has allowed himself more wriggle room than is immediately clear from the rhetoric,\" adds Mitter. \"It wouldn\\\\\\'t actually be that easy to simply dump the climate change deal because, by doing so, he would be dumping every single one of America\\\\\\'s allies, who have also signed up for it. He will be aware there will be a price to pay for that as well.\" The future of the European Union will be another debating point at the Swiss ski resort. The UK is set to invoke Article 50 at the end of March, which will trigger the start of Brexit negotiations. The French have their general election in May, with Front National leader Marine Le Pen likely to get into the final round of voting and with a chance of winning the presidency. \"If Le Pen does win, that will put a bomb under the structures of the European Union. I think it would put an end to the great European project, at least in its current form,\" says Mitter. The academic says that even if conservative candidate Francois Fillon is elected in France and Angela Merkel is returned in Germany, the EU still faces major uphill challenges. \"It still has the euro crisis, it still has the Italian banks problem and it still has relatively sluggish growth. Its structural problems will not have been resolved.\" Mitter, the son of academics originally from West Bengal, studied Chinese at Cambridge and was a Kennedy scholar at Harvard before embarking on an academic career. He has written a number of books on China, including the highly acclaimed China\\\\\\'s War With Japan, 1937-45: The Struggle for Survival, which has been translated into Chinese. He combines being director of the Oxford University China Centre, which he is contracted to until 2019, with being a presenter of the BBC Radio 3 arts program Free Thinking. Mitter, who attended Davos last year as a speaker, believes another of the major talking points there will be the future of US foreign policy under the new administration. \"A pre-Trump America, or any other president, would be concerned about things such as security in Europe. I suspect there is at least some part of the Trump administration that really doesn\\\\\\'t regard that as a first level American priority,\" he says. The future of trade within Asia itself will also be debated. The incoming president has already announced he will withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some have suggested that China may want to form its own alternative bloc, possibly built around RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) initiative. Mitter, however, believes that President Xi would much prefer to form a trading bloc that included the United States rather than going it alone \"I\\\\\\'m totally convinced by the idea that China would much rather have the US inside, whatever structure it is.\" The academic maintains that Xi is likely to provide a reassuring presence at Davos in a world of change. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the Geneva-based international organization, has already said the president will outline his country\\\\\\'s evolving role in the new global structure. \"Chinese politics is probably likely to be much more predictable and stable during 2017, certainly compared to an untried US President, the start of Brexit negotiations and the structural problems of the European Union. All of these are the political unknowns that will begin to unfold over the next 12 months,\" says Mitter. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page7)\\'\\n \\'Get ready for a complete rethink of the workplace as innovation takes manufacturing to a new level Factories have long held a place in the popular imagination, not just as sources of employment and community prosperity, but also as hectic, noisy, grimy and polluting facilities where thousands of people are employed in largely low-skill jobs. Today\\\\\\'s factories are changing. Breathtaking advances in technology, automation and globalization are transforming how and where manufacturers plan, construct, operate and integrate their factory networks. They are also ushering in significant operational, political and societal changes. From rust belt America to rural India and China, a chorus of voices is struggling to understand: How are technologies changing how we produce and distribute products? Are automation and free trade taking away valuable factory jobs? What type of skills will be required? How can communities prosper in the face of new production technologies? How and when should manufacturers upgrade their legacy equipment to embrace new technologies to boost yields and efficiency for greater profits or simply to remain competitive? These are the questions we\\\\\\'ve been pondering as we\\\\\\'ve worked as a Knowledge Partner on the World Economic Forum\\\\\\'s Future of Production initiative. Businesses, governments and society alike must understand the technological dynamics at play and collaborate to ensure that tomorrow\\\\\\'s factory towns prosper.    What will the factory of the future look like? The answers will come from the factory floor, where new technologies like 3D printing, advanced robotics, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, wearable devices and virtual and augmented reality are converging to create new value, enabling the hyperefficient and flexible factory of the future. The value created is real: Large global producers have increased efficiency and reduced costs by up to 30 percent across all operations, driven by improvements in overall operating efficiency, lower inventory, energy and water costs and reduction in incidents involving safety. While the pace of change, and how these changes will propagate across networks, will differ by industry and country, the factory of the future is a more digital, more virtual and more resource-efficient space. It is an environment that is more connected - both in terms of information availability and machines speaking to and directing each other. Automation, simulation, visualization and analytics are deployed more widely to eliminate waste and increase efficiency in material yields, energy consumption, effort and time. In particular, factories of the future have three common overarching characteristics: Digital shop floor processes that are connected, automated and flexible. The internet of things and connectivity combined with analytics and artificial intelligence will improve asset efficiency, decrease downtime and unplanned maintenance, and allow manufacturers to uncover new sources of value in services. By employing digital twins, simulations and virtual reality, designers and operators will virtually immerse in interactive media to optimize design, production processes and material flows.    New relationships between operators and machines. Technologies are changing the nature of work and skills required from operators. Robotics are automating most of the \"dull, dirty and dangerous\" tasks and, increasingly, collaborative robots are moving out of the cage to work side-by-side with operators. Augmented reality and wearables are also changing how operators train, assemble and make decisions on the shop floor; increasing flexibility, productivity and quality. Labor will actually remain cost-effective in many arenas, as technology allows workers to significantly improve their productivity even as overall numbers decline. Some human-cyber combinations will likely remain the dominant cog in factories for several years to come, certainly well into the coming decade. Structure, location, and scale of factories. The factory of the future is hyperefficient and sustainable, increasingly modularized with interchangeable lines that can be easily reconfigured for multiple production batches. Digital production technologies will allow software developers, product designers and production technicians to work in open, airy environments. As technology diminishes the role of low-cost labor and lowers the threshold of economies of scale, distributed manufacturing will become the norm, with producers augmenting their traditional production footprints with smaller and more flexible units located next to points of consumption, allowing them to meet local requirements with a more responsive supply chain. These more localized, more energy-efficient, lower-waste factories will contribute to advances in the circular economy. The author is a partner in the New York office of A.T.

Xi will pay a state visit to Switzerland on Jan 15 to 18 and attend the forum\\\\\\'s annual meeting in Davos on Jan 17 alongside corporate and political leaders, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Jan 10. The meeting was attended by Premier Li Keqiang in 2015 and by Vice-President Li Yuanchao last year. Xi will deliver a keynote speech when attending the meeting, Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong told a news briefing in Beijing. Xi\\\\\\'s attendance has attracted great attention amid sluggish international trade and investment, the rise of protectionism and its impact upon the multilateral trade mechanism, the diplomat noted. By participating in the meeting, the Chinese leader aims to explain China\\\\\\'s views and positions, and to offer a useful response \"to concerns of the international community about economic globalization\", Li said. China plans to analyze the deep-seated factors behind the problems of world economic growth and seek to find directions and pathways that point on the way out, Li added. Widespread political reshuffling across the globe has dampened investor confidence and added uncertainty to the already sluggish growth of the world economy since the economic crisis in 2008. World political and economic leaders also are anticipating Xi addressing the health of the world\\\\\\'s second-largest economy in the wake of fluctuations in the yuan and Beijing\\\\\\'s measures to rein in systematic financial risks, experts say. The vice-foreign minister said that Xi, during the meeting, will respond to the world\\\\\\'s focus on hotspot issues of Chinese economy and boost understanding of Chinese economic policy. \"China is ready to embark on in-depth discussions with various parties to jointly tackle major global challenges and promote the healthy, stable development of the world economy,\" Li said. Ruan Zongze, vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, says Xi\\\\\\'s first trip to the Davos meeting is to address \"the widespread lack of confidence over the prospects for the world economy and the lack of viable solutions\". Events last year, including the United Kingdom\\\\\\'s vote to leave the European Union, \"showcase the downward pressure of the global economy since the crisis in 2008\", and \"the gathering momentum against globalization and in favor of protectionism\", Ruan says. The world is expecting China to deliver a strong message against trade protectionism at the forum because the voices of smaller countries have not been enough of a counterbalance, Ruan adds. The forum will also be attended by such figures as British Prime Minister Theresa May and US Vice-President Joe Biden. Chen Fengying, a senior researcher on the world economy at China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, says: \"We should make it clear (at the forum) that the existing international economic cooperative mechanisms should not be changed because of the change in state leaders.\" Since the world economy and globalization are \"at a crossroad and a turning point\", it is time for Xi to demonstrate China\\\\\\'s power and duty as a major developing country, Chen says. Xi\\\\\\'s comments are also highly anticipated because China\\\\\\'s annual central economic work conference recently wrapped up, Chen notes. \"China\\\\\\'s economy is also at a crossroads. We could get either sustained growth or massive risks breaking out,\" Chen says. Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank monetary policy committee and an economist at Peking University, says China\\\\\\'s current priorities include eliminating systematic financial risks and stabilizing economic growth. During his stay in Switzerland, Xi also will visit the offices of the World Health Organization, the United Nations\\\\\\' Geneva office and the International Olympic Committee. At the Palais des Nations, home of the United Nations office, Xi will deliver a keynote speech about building the Community of Shared Destiny for Mankind. zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com    (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page1)\\'\\n \"As voices of protectionism rise, Chinese companies maintain a steady hand with their mergers and acquisitions overseas The voices of nativism, protectionism and populism have become louder and stronger, making the global need for inclusive development more obvious as the pace on the road to recovery in recent years has been slow. Global trade and investment was weaker in 2016 than in the previous year. Acceleration of economic growth is the first step in promoting inclusive development. Then comes sharing the achievement. The best way to accelerate economic growth is to encourage global investment. Investment has become a key engine of recovery. Data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says that global trade increased 2.7 percent year-on-year in 2015, with foreign direct investment increasing 38 percent to $1.7 trillion, meaning that investment has become a major growth force. However, global investment remained slow in 2016 - far less than the 2007 level of $2.28 trillion. Foreign direct investment in 2016 is expected to come in at $1.5 trillion or $1.6 trillion, or 10 to 15 percent below the 2015 level. In other words, the global economic recovery remains fragile at a low level of investment. All of the above means we need more investment.  Two years ago, some economists in the West complained that China\\'s economic slowdown dragged down the growth of the global economy and triggered a drop in bulk commodity prices. However, it ignored the demand created by the rapid growth of China\\'s outbound foreign investment. In 2015, China\\'s outbound FDI reached $145.7 billion, the second-largest total in the world, and outbound M&A accounted for nearly 40 percent of that. In 2016, outbound foreign direct investment will reach more than $170 billion, according to official data, and the value of Chinese corporate outbound M&A will top the world, according to Morning Whistle Group. Nowadays, complaints about Chinese economic growth have relaxed, even though it has slowed further. But European investment protectionalism against FDI by Chinese companies - as seen in the voices of critics, legislation and other measures - has been increasing gradually. Some M&A deals were stopped because of resistance from the European countries\\' governments or public opinion. Such criticisms and complaints are baseless, especially in the M&A field, because those deals will give both China and Western countries a better future. In fact, as some critics said, Chinese investors came for technology. Data from Morning Whistle show that 44 percent of M&A deals proposed by Chinese enterprises focused on gaining advanced technologies, 30 percent on gaining market channels and 10 percent on brand recognition. Chinese investors paid a premium for such M&As. In addition to making attractive offers, the Chinese investors also brought strategic resources - such as market opportunities in China - to their Western partners. The deals will increase jobs in both sides and bring win-win results. Some Western countries insisted that those deals, proposed at such high prices, were supported by subsidies from the Chinese government - low-interest loans, for example. They didn\\'t seem to know that about 70 percent of Chinese M&A deals were proposed by private companies, that more than 70 percent of Chinese M&A deals were conducted by Chinese-listed companies or that the high purchase prices were actually supported by Chinese private companies\\' shareholders in a stock market whose average price-to-earnings ratio is more than double that of European companies. In other words, these deals deserved such values, in combination with Chinese stock market valuation, and actually provided a channel for Western investors or owners to share in the premium Chinese capital market. It wasn\\'t subsidies. More Chinese companies tried to raise funds in overseas markets because the cost of financing is much lower than at home. Chinese enterprises hope they can build capital channels and financing platforms in overseas markets to reduce their financing costs and increase their investment and financing ability. Western complaints about the purchase prices offered by Chinese companies - which may be very high and thus attractive to the targets - come from competitors\\' jealousy, which will ultimately ruin the mutual benefits. It is not fair play. Chinese companies\\' investments in overseas markets will remain strong in 2017, boosted by technological upgrades, a decrease in the rate of domestic economic growth, the valuation gap between China and Western stocks, US Fed interest rate increases, etc., but growth will slow for both foreign and domestic entities. Companies will pay more attention to improvements in the global value chain when proposing overseas M&A deals, and investment in Belt and Road countries is encouraged and supported. The government didn\\'t intend to prevent normal outbound FDI through tighter foreign exchange rules; rather, it aimed to improve sustainability and to prevent money laundering. The pressure on both the price and volume of Chinese foreign exchange reserves can be expected to further relax in 2018 - or earlier - depending on the US federal interest rate cycle. Structural adjustments will help. So we forecast that the driving forces of growth will remain steady. Europe was the first destination that abstracted Chinese investment. From 2014 to 2016, the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany, South Korea and Canada topped the list of M&A activity with Chinese companies. The companies will take Europe as their first investment target in 2017, according to Morning Whistle. We hope both sides can open their minds and cooperate well to share the China premium and other benefits. We also hope Europe will remain the first choice for Chinese corporate M&A activity. The recovery of the world economy needs inclusive, fair and green investment. We hope the investments from Chinese companies will bring more opportunities to the destination countries, and promote inclusive development. We also noticed that the Chinese government is trying to absorb more foreign investment and giving more freedom to local governments at the beginning of 2017. We appreciate the help of Western investment in promoting China\\'s economic growth over the past 30 years. And we believe that Chinese investment overseas will bring a better future to the world.

During the visit, from Jan 15 to 18, Xi and his Swiss counterpart, Doris Leuthard, will announce a joint decision to scale up a free trade partnership that was launched in 2014, according to Chinese Ambassador to Switzerland Geng Wenbing. Increased action to facilitate two-way trade and investment tops Xi\\\\\\'s agenda for the visit, Geng says.   - Geng Wenbing, Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, says increased action to facilitate two-way trade and investment tops Xi Jinping\\\\\\'s agenda for the visit. Fu Jing / China Daily  \"Both sides will actively explore ways to upgrade the free trade agreement,\" he told China Daily. \"Leaders of both countries will join hands to send a strong signal against any form of global protectionism that blocks trade and investment flows.\" In addition to beefing up the trade relationship, Geng says, both sides will announce new measures to boost cultural exchanges, tourism and financial cooperation. During the trip, Xi will deliver a keynote speech at the annul meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He is scheduled to visit the Lausanne-based International Olympic Committee and the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva. He will also speak at the United Nations Office in Geneva before wrapping up his first overseas tour of 2017. Geng says both sides are determined to set an example on free trade, which should be followed by the European Union and other global players to pave the way for faster growth of the global economy. The two countries\\\\\\' free trade agreement, which waives most tariffs on goods, took effect in July, 2014. Talks began in 2011 and the two sides sealed the deal in 2013. Talks with Norway are ongoing, but Iceland has already entered into a free trade agreement with China. The European Union, meanwhile, insists that it should conclude a bilateral investment agreement with China before the two sides start free trade talks, though some of its member states are eager to clinch a deal with China. Geng says more countries have shown interest in free trade talks with China lately, mainly because Switzerland has already benefited from the partnership through export growth. Official figures from the Swiss government showed that overall exports slowed in October and November last year, but export volume to China maintained double-digit year-on-year growth in the same period. Exports to China increased 11.5 percent year-on-year in November, while the rise in October was 24.1 percent. \"Such rosy results have led more countries to become interested in free trade talks with China, and some of them even asked me for the text of the agreement between China and Switzerland,\" Geng says. \"I am sure that every country that enters such a trade arrangement with China will become a winner.\" Geng says China has been restructuring its investment and trade-led economy toward consumption and innovation, creating tremendous opportunities for imports. In December, the European Union, United States and Japan, the leading global economies, refused to fulfill a promise made 15 years ago when China joined the World Trade Organization to recognize China as an equal trade partner. But Switzerland joined dozens of WTO members in recognizing China\\\\\\'s market economy status back in 2007. Apart from efforts to boost trade, the leaders will also upgrade their political relationship, Geng says. Switzerland was the first Western country to establish diplomatic relations with the People\\\\\\'s Republic of China in 1950. In April, former president of the Swiss Confederation Johann N. Schneider-Ammann visited China. \"Within less than a year, President Xi is returning a state visit, and he is only visiting Switzerland during this tour, which indicates how much importance China has attached to the bilateral relationship,\" Geng says. fujing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page3)\\'\\n \"Overseas partnerships offer lucrative and beneficial opportunities for both sides, says veteran consultant Many countries should look to China\\'s successful record of attracting foreign investment and using it to help develop its economy, a veteran consultant says. Michael Enright, director of the Hong Kong-based strategy consultancy Enright, Scott & Associates, says there are some important lessons for other countries to learn from China. He was in Beijing recently launching his new book, Developing-China: the Remarkable Impact of Foreign Direct Investment, which demonstrates the enormous impact that FDI has on China. The first lesson for other countries to learn is that foreign investment can be a very powerful engine for development, Enright says.   Michael Enright, at the launch ceremony for his new book in Beijing. Provided to China Daily  Second is that using foreign investment as an engine of development can be managed, but a country has to develop not only capabilities in the workforce but also must develop the administrative and governmental capabilities to administer and manage a more advanced economy that includes foreign-invested enterprises. The book says that FDI accounts for only a bit over 2 percent of China\\'s gross capital formation. But if the FDI and the operations of foreign investment enterprises and the ripple effects of the supply chains and employee spending are also counted, the impact is 33 percent of China\\'s GDP. Enright thinks that estimate is still low. He said the spillover effect of foreign investment is uncountable. For example, its impact on Chinese companies through the transfer of technology, the adoption of modern management techniques, and the training of tens of thousands of Chinese professionals through corporate training and university programs based on a Western model. Foreign enterprises also help create distribution and supplier networks in China; help educate tens of thousands of professionals; give Chinese companies access into international markets (as foreign enterprises carry 75 percent of all of China\\'s international cargo); bring in world-class environmental standards; and cooperate on social responsibility standards. Enright says that when China started its reform and opening up in the 1980s, its economy lagged behind many other countries. A smart thing China did rather than trying to reinvent all the business models and technologies to develop a more advanced economy by itself was to attract good ideas and good companies from around the world to China. The country has its own historical circumstances, and has recognized that to develop its economy, all the good ideas cannot come from one place. It really needs to tap into global ideas, global sources of capital and global expertise, Enright says. Moreover, China has enormous potential with its large population, as well as its skills and capabilities, he says. In Enright\\'s view, China\\'s use of foreign capital has been managed carefully, step by step, to absorb foreign investment without experiencing many of the potential downsides. Although there are some foreign companies that think China has not opened up enough, he says any country would open only as much as it is comfortable with. What most foreigners don\\'t understand is that given China\\'s unique history, from the late 1950s to late 1970s, included basically no foreign investment. So when it started to open up, it had to gradually create the necessary administrative, regulatory and legal frameworks to support it.  But the more a country opens, the more investment and high-quality investment it can obtain, so China should be more confident and open to additional foreign investment, Enright says. While foreign investment benefits China, he says China has also brought many things to foreign investors. One of those has been the market. The stereotype outside China is that foreign companies come to China to make things with cheaper labor to send back overseas. That was true in the 1980s and maybe the first half of 1990s, he says. But foreign companies are now primarily in China to sell to China. Foreign companies sell far more in China than they export from China. Enright says that China did offer relatively inexpensive labor to the world in the early days of its opening-up, but that is changing. Increasingly, multinational companies are putting R&D facilities and their most advanced manufacturing facilities in China. In the old days they were looking for low-cost labor. Now they are looking for highly qualified labor, for skilled professionals, skilled scientists and that helps the companies, and it helps develop the Chinese economy as well, he says. Foreign companies in the past made their plans based on 10 percent annual GDP growth; now they have to adjust, he added. At the same time, Chinese companies have become more experienced and can better identify their markets and use high-class technology, which results in tougher competition in the domestic market. Those are two main mechanisms that will cause the multinationals to rethink, he says. Enright says China still has great potential, but many foreign companies haven\\'t realized it yet. He took the Belt and Road Initiative as an example, as it will cover a large population in more than 60 countries. It is a massive opportunity, and the potential is not only China but also Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia and Europe, because it proposes to build so much connecting infrastructure, he says. He says that the Chinese government has recognized that it is impossible for Chinese companies and Chinese financial institutions to do all the projects all by themselves, and certain technology and expertise will be required from foreign partnerships. In addition, many of the places along the Belt and Road are not places where Chinese companies have experience, but foreign companies do and that provides good opportunities for partnerships, too. But the key is: To partner successfully outside China, those companies also have to be partnering with the part that is inside China, Enright says. For China\\'s Manufacturing 2025 strategy, if you look at the leading technologies behind advanced manufacturing, the complete factory of automation systems, the internet of things, machine-to-machine communication systems right now the leaders in many of the technologies are outside of China, he says. If China really wants to develop to be the world\\'s leading advanced manufacturing center, a lot of cooperation with foreign companies would be good and good business for the foreign companies, he says. He says there is a great deal of confusion in the international community, because it is not clear what approach is best to get involved. There is also some fear that many initiatives might be exclusive to Chinese companies so it is best if China can work out the details soon. Enright says that as Chinese companies go international, there will be more need of mutual understanding over the next few years about what Chinese companies are allowed to do in foreign countries and what foreign companies are allowed to do in China. China became a major exporter, but with relatively few Chinese companies actually understanding the international market. And that is going to be one area in which working with foreign companies or allying with foreign companies is going to be critically important, he says. Certainly for the developing countries, capital, expertise and infrastructure investment from China could make major contribution to development. In the more advanced countries, Chinese investment is also contributing more to developing infrastructure, and it is creating need jobs. chenyingqun@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page32)\"\\n \\'Jewelry, perfume, fashion and accessories certainly fit the bill as luxury brands. But could fragrant flowers, like roses, be added to that category? Definitely, according to Pu Yi, founder and CEO of roseonly, a Beijing-based startup formed in 2013. \"Just like Tiffany in the US, and Mikimoto in Japan, roseonly is gradually becoming a new signature luxury brand embraced by the country\\\\\\'s middle class. We want to become a homegrown Chinese luxury brand,\" says Pu. Such an aspiration may be sound ambitious but is it realistic? The company, which spells its name with a lower-case \\\\\\'r\\\\\\', has had unprecedented success in China selling premium roses imported from Ecuador in South America to upwardly mobile, newly wealthy upper- middle-class consumers. Its bouquets are among the hottest gift choices for young Chinese.   - A sales representative at roseonly arranges product samples at one of its outlets in Beijing. Feng Yongbin / China Daily  Prices range from 999 yuan ($143; 138 euros; 117) for an 11-rose bunch to 9,999 yuan for a 99-rose bouquet. The startup expects the sales in 2016 via outlets in multiple cities and online stores to reach around 250 million yuan, up from 130 million yuan in 2015, 61 million yuan in 2014 and 14.6 million yuan in 2013. It expects sales to exceed 300 million yuan this year. Annual sales revenue has been surging, probably due to roseonly\\\\\\'s unique packaging and marketing, which emphasizes not the imported roses themselves but a once-in-a-lifetime expression of love for one special person (who is, usually, the buyer\\\\\\'s girlfriend, fiancee or wife). Information about buyers and bouquet recipients is stored in a database at the time of purchase. This information cannot be changed later. That means a customer can buy at roseonly only once - no repeat purchases by the same customer for a different recipient is allowed. This seemingly self-defeating strategy has paid off - the sales figures are proof. If more proof is needed, twice in recent months, roseonly witnessed sales surges. The latest was during the Christmas-New Year week. \"We\\\\\\'ve seen a 40 percent rise in sales during the Christmas season,\" Pu says. The earlier spike was around the Qixi festival, or the Chinese Valentine\\\\\\'s Day, in August. \"If my boyfriend buys me an expensive roseonly bouquet, it contains more than a bunch of roses; it signals his loyalty and a reassuring promise,\" says Wang Qin, 23, a Beijing resident. Investors may have caught a whiff of potential profits in roses. Angel investors chipped in with funds two months after roseonly launched. Tencent, owner of the WeChat app, poured $10 million into the startup. In 2014, IDG capital and Accel Partners invested more than $10 million (9.6 million euros; 8.1 million), followed by 190 million yuan from Genesis Capital, Prosperity Investment and Echo Capital. All that money over the years has helped roseonly to open 28 outlets in Beijing, Shanghai and other first- and second-tier cities. It is the biggest flower vendor on Tmall, Alibaba\\\\\\'s online marketplace.    The florist is now valued at $100 million, according to TechinAsia. Not surprisingly, roseonly wants to go beyond the Chinese mainland. It plans to open shops in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Singapore in the years to come. Pu describes the brand\\\\\\'s target demographic as men and women between the ages 25 and 45, with stable incomes and an appreciation for high-quality goods and affordable luxuries. According to a report by McKinsey, generational change and the rising prosperity of inland cities will power consumption for years to come. By 2022, more than 75 percent of China\\\\\\'s urban consumers will earn 60,000 yuan to 229,000 yuan a year, the McKinsey report says. \"There will be not only challenges but also plenty of opportunities for companies whose strategies reflect China\\\\\\'s new constellation of rising incomes, shifting urban landscapes, and generational change,\" says Pu. To ride the trend, roseonly has launched new offerings such as bouquets of exotic flowers, which it bundles with jewelry pieces in exquisite gift packages. \"We will expand the business to the high-end gift market,\" says Pu. \"We\\\\\\'ve so far come up with many love-related jewelry gifts like bracelets, necklaces and earrings, and will cooperate more with some of the world\\\\\\'s renowned designers and celebrities. \"The jewelry market has more potential than the flower market, and the gift market has even more.\" Most of roseonly\\\\\\'s jewelry gifts are designed to be rose-related, and target younger women and girls. The company also sells tailor-made gifts during peak seasons, such as a snowman necklace during Christmas and limited-edition designer jewelry associated with celebrities.

The measure was adopted to safeguard the insurers\\\\\\' role in the capital market as long-term providers of protection, rather than short-term speculators. The regulator lowered the maximum stake in an insurer a single shareholder can own from 51 percent to 33 percent in recently released draft rules currently open to public discussion. The regulator also banned life insurers from opening new branches if short-term insurance policies account for more than 50 percent of their total premiums on a quarterly basis. \"Tighter regulation, together with the low interest rates, will further constrain the business growth of insurers. Bigger players will be less affected than smaller ones, which may need to adjust their strategy accordingly,\" says Wei Tao, an analyst at BOC International Holdings. Insurers\\\\\\' total premiums were expected to exceed 3 trillion yuan ($431.4 billion; 411.6 billion euros; 350.8 billion) in 2016, a 25 percent increase year-on-year, according to analysts\\\\\\' forecasts. The outstanding value of investment by insurance funds had already exceeded 13 trillion yuan as of November. Aggressive stake bidding by insurance funds in the stock market has caught the regulator\\\\\\'s attention, amid serious concerns that this trend will result in greater volatility that could endanger the broader financial system. Shen Juan, an analyst at Huatai Securities, says in a research note that, given the tighter regulatory control, insurers are likely to rely more on sales of traditional long-term insurance products and adopt less aggressive investment strategies to manage their funds. The regulator\\\\\\'s crackdown on high cash-value products will constrain the premium growth of life insurers this year, with insurers exposed to significant asset-liability duration mismatches facing a more acute challenge, according to credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings Inc. lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page26)\\'\\n \\'More than 50 rooftops designed by some of the world\\\\\\'s most renowned and up-and-coming architects and landscape designers is featured in \"Rooftops: Islands in the Sky,\" Taschen\\\\\\'s photography book releasing February 15 in the United States.

Citing false bidding prices from the Bloomberg foreign exchange system, media reported a day ealier that the value of the onshore renminbi against the US dollar dropped below 7 yuan, sparking a fresh round of concerns over a potential acceleration in the currency\\\\\\'s depreciation. The People\\\\\\'s Bank of China, the central bank, immediately responded to the reports in a late-night statement, condemning them for being \"irresponsible\" and confirming that the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained stable at between 6.9500 to 6.9666. The overall expectation by analysts is that a weaker yuan could help boost export-oriented sectors such as commodities, textiles, shipping and chemicals. Yu Jianlong, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce, says the depreciation of the renminbi will enable companies to put their export volume on a firmer footing. But some argued that the effect on boosting exports could be limited, as the real exchange rate of the renminbi against a basket of currencies has not depreciated as much as the value against the dollar. Xiao Lisheng, a senior finance researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says that a weaker currency would mean greater risk-hedging costs for companies that plan to borrow dollar-denominated debt and seek to make outbound investments. \"The PBOC\\\\\\'s prompt response highlighted the fragile market sentiment toward the value of the renminbi,\" Xiao says. \"The pressure will likely be greater next year (2017) for China\\\\\\'s policymakers, as they are facing a tough option of either maintaining currency stability with tighter monetary policy or maintaining growth with a more accommodative policy.\" The value of the Chinese currency has depreciated against the dollar by more than 7 percent this year, hitting a record low in eight years. Some economists believe that it is only a matter of time before the currency falls below 7 yuan per dollar given the tightening cycle of the US Federal Reserve and decreasing investment returns at home. \"The depreciation of the renminbi means greater costs for currency conversion,\" says Xie Delong, vice-general manager of Sichuan Dawn Machinery Co.

Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. \\\\nUS authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News â\\\\x80\\\\x99 sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an â\\\\x80\\\\x9cabundance of caution.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nEarlier this week, there were also warnings that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpolling placesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d could be seen as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cattractive targetsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d for â\\\\x80\\\\x9clone wolfâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d attackers by individuals motivated by â\\\\x80\\\\x9cviolent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : \\\\nThe counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. \\\\nHowever, whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccivilâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the al Nusra Front â\\\\x80\\\\x93 in with the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmoderate rebelsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d they support. Therefore, al Qaedaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. \\\\nItâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. \\\\nIt is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbogeymanâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. \\\\nIt is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaksâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 near constant releases of her campaign chairâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s emails, but also due to the FBIâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmutinyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d which led them to re-open a probe into Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. \\\\nHowever, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime. \\\\nWhat are your thoughts?

Late last month, the Shanghai-based startup raised 400 million yuan ($57.56 million; 55.3 million euros; 47 million) in Series-D fundraising, attracting support from heavyweight investors such as Cathay Capital, Fortune Capital, Tiantu Capital and JD.com Inc. Announcing the funding details, CEO Chen Xuefeng says his company will use a large proportion of the investment to further support two new business lines. One focuses on growth in smaller cities, by partnering with local recycling stores. The other is to encourage consumers to rent new smartphones from the platform instead of buying them.    The company\\\\\\'s president, Zheng Pujiang, outlined the geographical rollout. \"To date, Aihuishou has secured the market in first-tier and second-tier cities,\" he says. \"Third-tier and smaller cities will be our next strategic priority.\" Since August, the group has established links with assorted partners in these markets. Aihuishou, established in 2011, recycles old electronics such as cellphones, laptops, cameras and assorted hardware. The platform then resells most of the used goods after cleaning and testing, and channels the low-value ones to professional recycling centers. To date, the platform has set up five operations centers and more than 200 recycling stores nationwide. In 2016, the average monthly revenue of Aihuishou exceeded 200 million yuan. It started turning a profit in September, the company said. It collected nearly 5 million cellphones last year, compared with fewer than 3 million in 2015, Industry data indicate future market potential. In the first 11 months last year, shipments of Chinese cellphones increased to 497 million, up 7.6 percent from the same period the previous year, according to figures from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The fast-growing business fueled Aihuishou\\\\\\'s plans for a public listing. \"The countdown to our initial public offering will begin in 2017,\" says CEO Chen Xuefeng. \"The preparation stage is likely to last three years.\" He says the company prefers to go public in the domestic market than to list abroad. \"Aihuishou\\\\\\'s online-to-offline business model has become mature and has raised the service standards of the recycling industry,\" says Cai Mingpo, president of Cathay Capital Private Equity. \"We see a bright outlook as the company has created strong barriers to competition and maintained a fast pace of growth.\" Yang Tinghui, investment director at Fortune Venture Capital Co, says compared with listing on the Nasdaq in the United States, Aihuishou\\\\\\'s business model and characteristics are more in line with the requirements of the domestic capital market in China. \"Aihuishou has big size and strong profitability.

While Palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations, the PFA last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body FIFA to suspend Israel. The PFA argued that the policies of the Israeli government and the Israel Football Association (IFA) violated FIFA rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory.\\\\nThe PFA has since been unable to push FIFA towards any punitive steps against Israel. Instead, FIFA opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse. Palestine is expected to take legal recourse if FIFA fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in January.\\\\nThe PFA\\'s focus since failing to get Israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in Israeli settlements on the West Bank from playing in Israeli lower divisions. FIFA rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federation\\'s territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation. The PFA rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize Israeli settlements and the occupation.\\\\nMORE...

The FIFA Council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in January. The PFA is likely to prepare its case for CAS, but wait with filing it until after the January meeting.\\\\nIsrael sees the Palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) that sees penalization as a means of forcing the Jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the 1967 Middle East war.\\\\nCondemnation of the Israeli occupation and settlements by the United Nations Security Council constitutes the legal basis for the PFA\\'s approach as well as potential challenges in international courts.\\\\nThe strength of the Palestinian position has been weakened changing [Persian] Gulf attitudes towards Israel and Saudi and United Arab Emirates pressure on Palestine Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. [Persian] Gulf states, despite paying lip service to the Palestinian cause, have become more public about their informal relations with Israel based on common opposition to expanding Iranian influence in the region.\\\\nWriting in the kingdom\\'s controlled press, a prominent Saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. The UAE last year agreed to the opening of an Israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency rather than the UAE government. Bahrain, as part of an agreement to host next year\\'s FIFA congress, has consented to issue visas to representatives of the IFA. Israeli nationals are barred from travelling to [Persian] Gulf countries.\\\\nAt the same time, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been pressuring Mr. Abbas to resolve his differences with Mohammed Dahlan, the controversial former Abu Dhabi-based Gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the Palestinian president. Mr. Dahlan is widely seen as a successor to 81-year old Mr. Abbas, who would be acceptable to Israel.\\\\nIsrael may be able to count on some degree of tacit [Persian] Gulf support within FIFA but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the Palestinians.\\\\nThe Palestinians\\' focus on the Israeli West Bank teams has however raised the bar for Israel. An agreement between Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and former FIFA president Sepp Blatter struck last year addresses many of the PFA\\'s grievances but not the issue of six the West Bank teams. Their status goes to the heart of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict: the legal status of territory occupied by Israel since 1967.\\\\nUnder the agreement, Mr. Netanyahu proposed to give Palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between Palestinian areas and those under Israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of Palestinian soccer. Mr. Netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players\\' travel between the West Bank and Gaza that are separated by Israeli territory.\\\\nIsrael initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in 15 years, a West Bank team, Hebron\\'s Al Ahli, passage to Gaza to play a Palestine Cup final against the strip\\'s Al Shejaia. Hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the PFA cancelled the return match in Hebron after Israel agreed to grant passage to only 33 of the 37 players who were scheduled to travel. Implementation of the agreement has since evaporated.\\\\nThe PFA, by putting the West Bank teams at the top of their agenda, has made it tougher for FIFA and Israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of Israeli-Palestinian peace making. Israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court. Yet, that may be exactly what would best serve the Palestine Authority\\'s overall strategy.\"\\n \\'Firm seeking to take a bigger slice of the action from Apple in premium market Huawei Technologies Co\\\\\\'s renewed focus on profits in 2017 signals a shift in its smartphone business, as the Chinese tech group seeks to outsell Apple Inc in the premium handset sector, analysts said on Jan 2. The world\\\\\\'s third-largest smartphone vendor says it will focus on boosting profits this year, as it deals with greater global economic uncertainty.   - Attendees inspect Huawei P9 smartphones on display at the China International Information Exhibition in Beijing. Nanshan / For China Daily  \"Despite our robust revenue growth, marketing costs and retail channel investments are rising too quickly,\" says Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei\\\\\\'s consumers business. The consumer unit, which mainly includes smartphones, saw its sales increase 42 percent to 178 billion yuan ($25.6 billion; 24.4 billion euros; 20.8 billion) in 2016, Yu says. Roger Sheng, a senior hardware analyst at Gartner Inc, says the announcement indicates Huawei is no longer content with a rapid rise in smartphone shipments. \"It realized there is an urgent need to prioritize profits, especially as the global smartphone market reaches a saturation point and competition heats up.\" Huawei shipped 139 million handsets in 2016, up 29 percent year-on-year. By comparison, the global smartphone market grew by just 1 percent, research firm International Data Corp estimates. According to Sheng, the Shenzhen-based company has done a good job in cracking the high-end segment. Shipments of its premium handset P9 series exceeded 10 million units within eight months. \"But costs have outpaced its revenue and gross margin growth after Huawei wrote big checks for marketing,\" he says. Huawei has signed Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi and US actress Scarlett Johansson as global ambassadors to promote its consumer electronics. Last year, Huawei grew rapidly in overseas markets but lost its home crown to domestic rival Oppo Electronics Corp. The firm said it would streamline its smartphone product lineup and improve supply chain management. Nicole Peng, research director at Shanghai-based consultancy Canalys, says it is difficult for Huawei to balance its revenue growth and profit growth in the short term, as it still needs to rely on large-scale marketing to shape its brand in foreign countries. \"Our research shows that if a firm\\\\\\'s smartphone sales exceed a 10 percent share in a single market, it will have bigger say in its ties with retailers and handset parts makers.

China Investment Corp President Tu Guangshao says cross-border investment is vital for China\\\\\\'s economic growth and structural adjustment. \"As a financial investor, China Investment Corp is not seeking to control industry. Instead, we want to cooperate with partners at home and abroad to participate in global investment and create a win-win situation,\" Tu says. His comments came after the latest move: China Investment Corp, Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Management are holding talks about making a joint offer for Singapore-based Global Logistic Properties, according to news agency Bloomberg in November. Tu says regional cooperation is an important part of globalization and the Belt and Road Initiative is a key development of regional cooperation. He adds that CIC will work closely with its partners to seek opportunities under the initiative.    There are challenges in cross-border investment - such as the relationship between economic benefits and social responsibility, labor and environmental protection - and difficulties in developing multilateral investment agreements, according to Tu. Jiang Guorong, a managing director of UBS Group AG, says China\\\\\\'s cross-border investment developed rapidly since 2015 because of a number of factors. \"Increasing demand for companies\\\\\\' business, increases in production capacity and output, overseas technology and capital and global asset allocation can explain booming cross-border investments,\" Jiang says. Jiang says developed economies such as the United States and Europe have been popular destinations for cross-border investments, while countries along the Belt and Road will be increasingly attractive. Ding Xuedong, chairman of China Investment Corp, says that CIC in the future will pay more attention to alternative investments - asset classes other than stocks, bonds and cash - and set up a sustainable development mechanism to prevent risks.

The company has the advantage of extensive experience accumulated from numerous Chinese and global projects over the years. It made a name for itself in the UK in 2014 by becoming one of the two contractors for Manchester\\\\\\'s 800 million ($1.3 billion; 956 million euros) Airport City Manchester project.   - Beijing Construction Engineering Group works on the Airport City Manchester project. Provided to China Daily  Now it has established a solid foothold in the UK with two additional property development projects. It is continuing to look for new opportunities, especially infrastructure projects related to the Northern Powerhouse - the UK government\\\\\\'s program to revitalize growth in northern England through infrastructure construction, which is set to become more important after Brexit. \"We see a lot of opportunities for future expansion in the UK market. Our goal is to look for suitable projects in the UK, and in particular northwest England, because we think the UK\\\\\\'s Northern Powerhouse strategy will bring many opportunities,\" says Yu Dongwen, UK operations director of BCEG. BCEG, which was established in Beijing in 1953, already has a presence in many developing countries. It expanded into Western markets in 2007 by building a hospital in Dallas, Texas. BCEG also worked on other projects in the US, Canada and Australia. Examples include a retirement home in Los Angeles and a commercial center in Australia. BCEG\\\\\\'s first project in Europe was Airport City Manchester, with the company responsible for 50 percent of the construction work, alongside the British contractor Carillion. It is also an equity partner, investing a 20 percent stake into the project.    Spread over an area of 465,000 square meters, the project includes construction of offices, hotels, advanced manufacturing facilities, and logistics and warehousing facilities. Yu says his team has already made significant progress on the basic infrastructure work for the project, aiming to finish the majority of infrastructure work in 2017. It has already started designing hotels and offices for construction this year. BCEG\\\\\\'s involvement in Airport City Manchester can be traced back to 2011 when the UK and China signed an infrastructure cooperation agreement. In 2013, when former prime minister David Cameron went to Beijing to promote the project, BCEG was invited to bid for it as a part of a consortium. \"We see Airport City Manchester as a first step into the UK market and an opportunity for us to gain experience and understand the UK\\\\\\'s construction market, so that we can take on bigger projects gradually and with more confidence,\" Yu says. He says experience can relate to construction methods, working with local contractors and suppliers, maintaining a good relationship with the British government, setting up local teams and developing a working relationship with local advisers. BCEG\\\\\\'s efforts won praise from Lynda Shillaw, CEO of MAG Property, the property arm of Manchester Airport Group. \"BGEG is a valuable partner in the development of Airport City and a positive example of the inward investment that is being attracted from China,\" she says. \"This is the first major infrastructure project in the UK with the involvement of a Chinese company as an equity partner, and it demonstrates how a new wave of investment from China is transforming infrastructure and development in the UK,\" Shillaw says. After building a reputation with the Airport City Manchester project, BCEG successfully started two new projects. The first was Middlewood Locks, a residential project that employed the Beijing-based company as a design and construction contractor. The second is St Michael\\\\\\'s, a residential and commercial property development that has two tall towers and is located in the heart of Manchester, near Town Hall. BCEG is investing a 21 percent stake in St Michael\\\\\\'s, and is in charge of design and construction. It will play a supporting role in sales by promoting the residential and office units in China.    Yu says BCEG\\\\\\'s key advantages in the UK market include its competitive edge as a highly international company, and its comprehensive supply chain. \"The UK construction market is very mature. It has a good legal framework and we can learn a lot of lessons here; but still, the amount of construction going on in the UK is nothing compared to China. \"In Manchester, for example, the only tall tower in the city is the Hilton Hotel. The rest of the buildings here are quite old, so perhaps compared with local construction companies we have a lot of experience.\" BCEG has worked on many recent big projects in China, like the new offices of the Beijing government, the headquarters of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the APEC conference center and the Beijing New Airport, among others. BCEG has offices in 27 countries so it has accumulated experience from different international markets. In addition, it has a comprehensive supply chain. \"We can supply our UK projects with cost-effective materials, which are either our own materials or materials from our existing suppliers in China,\" Yu says. He explains that many European construction firms would actually like to buy materials from China, but the fact that BCEG is a Chinese company and knows the Chinese market well means it can source the most cost-effective materials with the same quality. In addition, BCEG\\\\\\'s role as an investment partner in some projects where it is also the contracted builder means it is able to become involved in the project at an early stage. \"This means we can give the project owner advice on what is possible and efficient, so that their initial designs are made with construction practicality in mind. Then there will not be so many alterations at later stages,\" Yu says. Christopher Bovis, professor of European and international business law at the University of Hull, says the ability of Chinese firms like BCEG to act as both financial investors and construction contractors helps with their profitability. \"As a financial investor, they can be incentivized to improve the efficiency of the supply chain and create savings through volume, so the project will generate better returns.\" BCEG\\\\\\'s international expansion fits into the trend of Chinese infrastructure builders going global, supported by the Chinese government. Examples of such companies include Liaoning Fortone, a private construction business in Shenyang, currently constructing two 299-megawatt combined heat and power stations in Wales, and China Triumph International Engineering Co, which built six solar farms in the UK. Yu says BCEG\\\\\\'s internationalization strategy fits roughly into three phases, which apply to many Chinese construction companies in general. The first was in the 1970s, when China sent many construction workers to developing nations, such as parts of Africa, as a part of its financial aid. A lot of those first projects built according to Chinese standards and much of the construction was done by Chinese workers, he says. The second phase mainly happened in Southeast Asian countries, before the Asian Financial Crisis. The third phase happened after 2000. \"This third phase involved much of the expansion into developed markets, such as the UK,\" says Yu. During this process we have taken on a different model of expansion. In developed markets, where we cannot easily second many employees, we mostly rely on local partners and play the role of project managers, leveraging on our experiences and management skills.\" Looking into the future, Yu says his team is keen to expand across Europe, and especially in the UK. He believes construction opportunities in northwestern England will not be affected by Brexit-related uncertainties because the UK market is currently at a point where population growth is creating a large demand for property, and this demand is not being met by current market supply. \"Brexit means the UK needs to generate more growth from its own economy, and the Northern Powerhouse can supply a lot of this growth. The fact that many Chinese companies are interested in Northern Powerhouse-related investment opportunities means that we can play a role in leading these investments, and invest alongside other Chinese companies,\" says Yu. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page30)\\'\\n \\'E-commerce companies say they will make great efforts to boost traditional enterprises and upgrade the real economy as the government published plans to develop e-commerce business during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). The plans set goals to increase the trading volume of e-commerce to 40 trillion yuan ($5.76 trillion; 5.49 trillion euros; 4.68 trillion) by 2020, including 10 trillion yuan from online retail businesses. The e-commerce market is expected to employ 50 million people by the end of 2020, according to the plan. The plans also set out five tasks to expand the e-commerce market, such as speeding the upgrading, promoting its deep integration of e-commerce with traditional industry, improving the public service system of e-commerce and optimizing its governance. JD.com Inc, China\\\\\\'s second-largest e-commerce player, says the plan is to improve the quality and promote the upgrading of e-commerce, which will play an important role in driving the transformation of the real economy, deepening supply-side reform and achieving the integration of the internet and the real economy. The company says cutting-edge technologies, including big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and intelligent hardware, will aid the development of e-commerce. And, e-commerce players will utilize new technologies extensively during the period of the plan. Chinese cross-border B2B e-trade company DHgate says: \"The plan is put forward to promote the deep integration of e-commerce with traditional industries. We have built bridges for small and medium-sized enterprises to enter overseas markets since 2004.\"    In the future, DHgate will help traditional enterprises transform and upgrade, as well as find new growth points for the country\\\\\\'s foreign trade. China is the world\\\\\\'s largest e-commerce market, with e-commerce market turnover reaching 16.4 trillion yuan. The turnover of the online shopping market reached 3.8 trillion yuan last year, according to iResearch Consulting Group. E-commerce will help drive innovation in healthcare, education, culture and tourism, becoming a key engine for economic growth, according to the plan. Moreover, the plan promotes the development of cross-border e-commerce. Kaola, a shopping platform run by online gaming services provider NetEase Inc, says the plan is good news for cross-border e-commerce and beneficial for the whole industry\\\\\\'s healthy and efficient development. The company plans to cultivate specialized talent in cross-border e-commerce, continue to create more employment opportunities, and boost the skills of employees. Lu Zhenwang, CEO of the Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy, says the plan offers a clear development target for e-commerce and indicates the direction for its future development. \"The next step should be how to better integrate traditional industry with e-commerce,\" Lu says. fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page28)\\'\\n \"Chinese oil giant among 29 firms to bid for tenders as a nation recovers from international sanctions China National Petroleum Corp, one of the country\\'s oil giants, has been invited to bid for Iran\\'s crude and natural gas development projects as the Persian Gulf state seeks investment in energy. CNPC, together with 28 other oil companies including Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PJSC Gazprom, is among the international companies that have qualified to bid for tenders, according to Iran\\'s oil ministry If CNPC wins, the deal would be in the interests of both countries, reviving Iran\\'s energy industry which has been hard hit by international sanctions while satisfying China, the world\\'s second-largest economy, which has a strong demand for energy. Iran is trying to fast-track projects to boost oil and gas production amid low prices and wants to sign agreements as soon as possible. However, Alastair Syme, an oil analyst at Citigroup Inc in London, warns companies to be wary of investing too quickly or too much in Iran. According to a senior engineer with CNPC, despite years of sanctions leading to a hammered economy and infrastructure, Iran, with the world\\'s biggest natural gas reserves-estimated by BP Plc at 34 trillion cubic meters- still has significant strategic importance, with its substantial reserves of oil and gas.    Strategically located in the Middle East and sharing land borders with 15 nations, Iran also plays a crucial role in the Belt and Road Initiative as an energy hub, he says. According to CNPC, the company has been present in Iran since 2004 and is engaged in oil and gas operations and oilfield services. In 2009, the company signed contracts with National Iranian Oil Co to develop the North Azadegan Oilfield and Phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, which began trial production in 2015. Iran exported 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day to China in 2015, and the country recently signed a $4.8 billion (4.6 billion euros; 3.9 billion) natural gas development project with CNPC and Total. Iran aims to attract more than $100 billion in foreign investment to boost the country\\'s energy sector. The country has doubled its exports as crude prices rallied. Iran boosted oil output in 2016 by 870,000 barrels per day to 3.67 million bpd by November, and has reached several preliminary agreements with international companies, despite no concrete deals having been signed yet, Bloomberg says. The country has set a target for daily output of 5.7 million bpd of crude and condensate early in the next decade, according to Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page25)\"\\n \\'Company sees profit potential in recycling vast numbers of used power packs, while helping to avoid an environmental mess GEM Co Ltd, the listed group involved in urban mining - the recycling of metal, old electronics, batteries and catalytic converters that would otherwise be left to decompose in landfills - says it sees great opportunities in lithium battery reuse as China\\\\\\'s new-energy car sales rapidly expand. \"Although the economy is cooling down, one thing keeps growing - waste,\" says Xu Kaihua, chairman of GEM. Xu says China has around 6 million metric tons of electronic waste. Every year, the country generates 24 billion waste batteries.    \"The waste is an urban mine to be exploited and an environmental disaster at the same time,\" he says. Founded in 2001, the company, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, went public in 2010 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It now has net assets of 6.7 billion yuan ($963.5 million; 926.3 million euros; 787.2 million). In 2003, GEM proposed the idea of \"digging into the urban mines\" to recycle used batteries, electronic waste, scrap cars and rare metals such as nickel, tungsten and cobalt. Battery recycling is an important part of GEM\\\\\\'s business portfolio, which accounted for 25 percent of its total revenue of 3.3 billion yuan, up 45.7 percent from the same period last year, in the first half of this year. The profits from battery recycling totaled 36.6 percent of its net profit of 172 million yuan for the half, which was up 30 percent from last year. Lithium battery production is expanding thanks to the fast growth of the new-energy vehicle sector. The Lithium Institute of Shenzhen Gaogong Industry Research Co says that in the third quarter of 2016, national output of lithium battery materials was worth 11 billion yuan.    According to research by Li Junhua, chief researcher at the Shenzhen-based ylz360.com, a website for energy consulting, sales revenues from recycled metals from lithium batteries - including cobalt, nickel, manganese, iron and aluminum - will increase sharply to 5.2 billion yuan in 2018, 13.6 billion yuan in 2020, and more than 30 billion yuan by 2023. The new-energy vehicle plan projects that by 2020 the annual production capacity of the industry will be 2 million units, with sales to date at a cumulative 5 million units. Xu Shiguo, deputy director of GEM\\\\\\'s new-energy material research institute, says the company has formed a recycling network throughout China, with 12 waste recycling bases. Since 2005, GEM has treated 15,000 tons of cobalt, 10,000 tons of nickel and 4,000 tons of manganese in its effort to build an industrial chain of recycled raw materials. \"Our goal is to build a closed cycle in the industry from materials, batteries, new-energy car manufacturing, supply chain finance and power battery recycling,\" Xu says. yangziman@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page27)\\'\\n \\'NASA to test in flight folding wing page: 1 link NASA is set to begin testing a new wing design that would change shape in flight, bending up or down, to increase yaw stability, reduce required rudder size, and decrease drag. The Boeing 777X is set to introduce wingtips that fold on the ground, to allow the aircraft to fit in existing gates with a longer wingspan. NASA is set to begin testing the Spanwise Adaptive Wing, which would add shape-memory alloy actuators to the wingtip area that would bend the tips up or down. The SMA actuators would activate when heated electrically, so there is no need for complex hydraulic lines or actuators. Beginning in Spring of 2017, NASA will start flying the Area-I PTERA UAV. It has a 176 inch wingspan, with the outer 15 inches moving as far as 75 degrees up or down. PTERA is not set up for SAW, but it appears that it could see a 40% rudder authority. The idea behind SAW is similar to what was done with the XB-70, with the wingtips angled down. Boeing will introduce folding wings to commercial aviation when the 777X airliner enters service at the end of 2019. But the devices could become commonplace on future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The 777X has almost 24 ft. more wingspan than todayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s 777 to optimize lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding the tips on the ground keeps the larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. But NASA is investigating whether also folding the wing in flight could save still more fuel. The Spanwise Adaptive Wing (SAW) concept will be tested on the ground and in flight in a rapid feasibility assessment under NASAâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s new Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The goal is to show that angling the outboard wing sections up or down can increase yaw stability and control, and reduce rudder size and tail drag.\\'\\n \"3 Shares\\\\n2 0 0 1\\\\nThe signing of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) on the 30th of October marks the beginning of North America\\'s annexation of Europe. The negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors. For over 751 deputies in the European Parliament, there are more than 30 thousands lobbyists. The Society for European Affairs Professionals (SEAP) - the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations â\\\\x80\\\\x93 this is the real power block in Europe. The European worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions. Multinational corporations will have unlimited power over European workers, who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle.\\\\nWill European workers lie down and accept this imposture? What concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over European workers? Which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which, if implemented, would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold?\\\\nThere are currently no political parties running in the major European elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers\\' interests. But there are some political movements which threaten the corporate \\'power-elite\\'. We will mention them below.\\\\nThere are two important geopolitical processes to consider here. The first is the East-West corporate , geopolitical axis. America is pulling the European peninsula away from the Eurasian continent. With the installation of a neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, Washington attempted to re-create an \\'Intermarium\\' from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and down to the Eastern Mediterranean - driving a permanent wedge between Russia and Germany.\\\\nIn order to facilitate the social transformation of Europe into a \\'America Minor\\', millions of \\'pilgrims\\' are necessary. Hence, the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class- conscious European workers with deracine youths - in some instances educated enough to do the low-paid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the \\'Power-Elite\\'.\\\\nIn the new Trotskyite language of this imperial order, any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is \\'fascist\\'. Fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind. In each European country there is a ready-made army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies, attack police and scream \\'fascist\\' and \\'racist\\' at working-class people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare. These \\'antifa\\' are the modern equivalent to Oswald Mosley\\'s fascist gangs in the 1930s; they represent the same class interests .Petty-bourgeois leftism is the New World Order\\'s avant-garde.\\\\nA favourite passtime of the \\'Antifa\\' mob is throwing stones at police officers. One can only gain acceptance in the anti-fascist gang by showing how much one hates the \\'pigs\\'. So, police officers from honest working-class families get burned alive while the anti-fa mob chants slogans from the Spanish Civil War. Such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations. The agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services. French police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over French suburbs. They complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents. They have been demonstrating in Paris. They have been calling for an end to the control of the French police by free masonry. Exacerbating the problem is the deep-seated racism of many police officers who target Black youths with spot-checksm â\\\\x80\\\\x93 very often without reason.\\\\nThe recent demonstrations by French police in France against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the French police could be waking up to the reality that France is government by a criminal gang. After the Magnanville terrorist attack in June where two police officers were killed, a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of President Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls. It was a highly significant act of insubordination.\\\\nThe police, who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class, are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting; they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another - that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses.\\\\nMany of these dissident police officers are linked to Le Pen\\'s National Front. A reliable source in French intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the far-right than the so-called \\'far left\\'. They see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order, whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology. From the \\'Arab Spring\\' to Nuit Debout, the far-left are the life-blood of capitalism. The potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of working-class gains is something that needs more study.\\\\nWhat should we make of all this in the context of CETA? As I have said on numerous occasions, the far right in France are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses; they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie. But the National Front are regularly denounced by the media, not for being right wing. Rather, they are dismissed as being closer to the far left. The prospect of raising worker\\'s salaries, nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to working-class families.\\\\nAs I have pointed out before, looking at a debate between the Trotskyist Jean-Luc Melanchon and Marine Le Pen in 2011, one would have thought that Le Pen was was the leftist and Melanchon the right-wing militarist. Melanchon shamelessly defended the NATO bombing campaign of Libya, while Le Pen opposed it!\\\\nCivil war on the horizon\\\\nThe right-wing presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the French territory between Muslims and non-Muslims. He Quote: s Francois Hollande\\'s own writings to back up his claims. Everyone is talking about an imminent civil war. In the bars and cafes of Paris one can hear more and more disgruntled French citizens talking about media disinformation, the demonisation of Russia, the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class.\\\\nThe scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of French politics. But one should not have illusions about the National Front; they are following the menacious Zionist narrative on the war on terror: Muslims are the problem. The party\\'s vice-president Forian Philippot is close to the ultra-Zionist lawyer Gilles-William Goldnagel, a friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\\\nPhilippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate Jean- FrÃ©dÃ©ric Poisson who said Hillary Clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the Zionists. Poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) where he sought forgiveness. He was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget! In spite of the National Front\\'s anti-Muslim bias, an increasing number of Muslims are voting for the party. Many Muslims prefer the National Front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left â\\\\x80\\\\x93 with their pseudo \\'anti-racism\\' and \\'humanitarian\\' wars.\\\\nThere have also been major strikes by police in Ireland for similar reasons to France. French workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat. Meanwhile the French government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to Britain to stay in France. The Socialist Party is creating a new electorate. It is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants. The oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through GMOS, Takfiri anti-Islam and total reification of life. CETA is the beginning of the end for social hope. It is the prelude to the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the most evil trade deal in history.\\\\nFrench vice-president of the Trilateral Commission Herve de Carmoy wrote a book in 2007 entitled \\'L\\'Euramerique\\' â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Euramerica, where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic super-state run by a financial oligarchy. CETA is the prelude to that project.\"\\n \\'By Catherine J. Frompovich One of the attorneys with whom I network on various issues was so incensed about a recent news â\\\\x80\\\\x98eventâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 that I... \\'\\n \\'Now comes President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s claim Monday at the key US military base overseeing the war on ISIS -- US Central Command in Tampa, Florida -- that the media aren\\\\\\'t reporting terrorism for \"reasons\" the President didn\\\\\\'t elaborate upon. Trump told the CENTCOM audience, \"You\\\\\\'ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it\\\\\\'s happening. It\\\\\\'s gotten to a point where it\\\\\\'s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn\\\\\\'t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.\" To \"prove\" that the media aren\\\\\\'t covering terrorism adequately the Trump White House, which is fighting in court to reinstate a refugee ban citing the terrorist threat, on Monday night released a list of 78 \"major\" terrorist attacks since September 2014, claiming, \"Most have not received the media attention they deserved.\" This is one of the biggest baloney sandwiches this White House has foisted on the public since ... well ... the \"Bowling Green massacre,\" but it\\\\\\'s a much bigger and harder-to swallow helping of baloney because it is the President who is forcing it down our throats rather than one of his aides. Taking the White House timeline of terrorist attacks, I ran it through the Nexis database, which is an authoritative resource for tracking media hits of all types, including in newspapers, magazines, wire service reports, TV news shows and the like. The results show that terrorist attacks over the past couple of years are, in fact, some of the most well-reported stories of our times. The total number of media hits for the 78 terrorist attacks that the White House released Monday is 80,878, or about an average of slightly more than 1,000 mentions per incident. And those numbers clearly understate how much coverage the media have given these incidents because a Nexis search only will display a maximum of 3,000 mentions for any given search. There are 16 terrorist attacks on the White House list of purportedly under-covered attacks that each elicited more than 3,000 media mentions. The following are a representative sample: \"?In Ottawa in October 2014 Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a Canadian soldier. \"?Two months later in Sydney, Man Haron Monis killed two Australians. \"?In March 2015, 21 tourists were killed at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. \"?Two months later in Garland, Texas, two ISIS-inspired militants attacked a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest. Luckily no one was killed except the terrorists. \"?In Tunisia, also in 2015, 38 were killed at a beach popular with Westerners. \"?In October 2015, 224 were killed in Sinai, Egypt, when ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet with a bomb. The terror attacks in Paris and Nice, France, that Trump cited in his CENTCOM speech also received more than 3,000 media mentions. The terrorist attacks that didn\\\\\\'t get as much coverage were -- surprise --- the ones where there were no deaths or that took place in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh where there is little independent media reporting. In three cases, there were no articles listed in the publications included in the Nexis database, and in each of those cases there were no casualties. The media, including CNN, have exhaustively covered terrorism around the globe since the 9/11 attacks made the issue a central national security concern. Indeed, the wall-to-wall media coverage of the ISIS attacks in Paris in November 2015 in which 129 were killed and the ISIS-inspired attack in San Bernardino, California, a month later in which 14 were killed was instrumental in boosting Trump in the polls, according to the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight Many Americans felt threatened by the ISIS-directed and ISIS-inspired attacks. As the presidential campaign was in full swing at the beginning of 2016, just over half of Americans said they were very or somewhat worried that they, or a member of their family, would be victims of a terrorist attack. This was the largest number to feel that way since just after the 9/11 attacks. And how did so many Americans learn about the terrorist attacks they were so scared of? Here\\\\\\'s a clue: It wasn\\\\\\'t through telepathy. Below is the official White House timeline of terrorist attacks since September 2014 with my annotations in bold about the media coverage they each received.

That is because buyer interest in office buildings, serviced apartments and commercial complexes is rising, according to a research report by DTZ/Cushman & Wakefield, a realty services provider. The report says the realty investment market in China has been \"particularly active\" in 2016 and may continue to thrive in 2017.   A potential buyer seeks information about property projects at a real estate expo in Shanghai. Yang Yi / For China Daily  Nationwide, bloc deals were worth some 200 billion yuan this year. In Shanghai alone, bloc deals exceeded 130 billion yuan, more than double that in 2015, according to DTZ. In terms of transaction value in Shanghai, office building deals accounted for more than 75 percent of all transactions. In terms of transacted space, they accounted for more than 70 percent. \"An obvious trend is that domestic buyers are dominating the market, and the average transaction value of deals is rising. Domestic buyers are favoring premier office buildings that bring stable and steady income. Investors are looking for quality assets, and the real estate market provides good opportunities,\" says Jim Yip, managing director of Investment and Advisory Services, China, DTZ/Cushman & Wakefield. As residential property policies have been tightened earlier this month, investors are looking at commercial realty. The easier interest rate environment has also encouraged buyers to look at bigger deals, analysts say. Insurer-linked funds, which have been widely reported to have acquired overseas assets in previous years, are also allocating huge amounts to domestic assets like office buildings, commercial complexes and shopping malls. Post transaction, buildings may be refurbished or transformed for other purposes, based on current trends. For example, old hotels in central locations are turned into office buildings, the DTZ report says. Office buildings in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Chengdu are in great demand as they play a key role in driving regional growth, the report says. Serviced apartments are also expected to become a key real estate category and an investor target in the next few years, particularly in first- and second-tier cities, given the rise in transaction value. For instance, Shanghai\\\\\\'s serviced apartments generated 7.15 billion yuan in 2016 sales, up from 4.2 billion yuan in 2015. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page27)\\'\\n \\'Research covers law, politics, trade and economic zones along 64-nation trading route across Asia to Europe In 2017, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, or CCPIT, will complete its research on the laws and business regulations of 64 countries and regions along the Belt and Road Initiative to ensure that Chinese outbound direct investment faces fewer risks, officials said on Dec 29. The research projects will focus on law studies and assessments of commercial environments and political situations, as well as disparities between economic zones and nonzone markets in each country or region along the initiative.   - A businesswoman from the United States (left) attends an investment and trade fair in Xiamen, Fujian province. Zhang Guojun / Xinhua  Feng Yaoxiang, CCPIT spokesman, says the research will give Chinese companies better knowledge of the markets they want to invest in. Market demand, industrial structure, insurance policies, terrorism risk and inflation rate will all be studied to help companies avoid risks. The research will cover most of the countries and regions along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, Feng says. The CCPIT set up 102 trade information offices to provide early warning and legal services in 2016 in major export-oriented provinces and cities, such as Zhejiang and Shanghai. Liu Chao, deputy director-general of the council\\\\\\'s department of legal affairs, says many countries along the two routes, including Turkey, Poland and Malaysia, have good infrastructure and industrial foundations to support their growth. But for some others, developing infrastructure and services remains crucial. The council will also offer legal advice, consultation services and practical measures to Chinese companies regarding Section 337 investigations to improve their ability in dealing with trade remedy investigations in 2017. Launched by the US International Trade Commission, Section 337 investigations are related to claims involving intellectual property rights. China encountered 117 trade remedy investigations launched by 27 countries and regions, with a total of $14 billion (13.3 billion euros; 11.4 billion) involved, between January and Dec 21, according to the Ministry of Commerce. Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang urged the Office of the US Trade Representative on Jan 5 to treat Chinese companies objectively, as China has made significant progress in improving the protection of intellectual property in recent years. His comments came after the trade representative recently included four e-commerce websites and six manufacturers in China on its 2016 blacklist of \"notorious marketplaces\".

The Caixin General Services Purchasing Managers\\\\\\' Index edged up to 53.4 from 53.1 in November, according to the survey conducted by financial information service provider Markit, sponsored by Caixin Media. The previous high was 53.8 in July 2015. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 represents contraction. Demand in the sector picked up as new orders at service companies rose in December at the fastest pace in 17 months. Rising raw-materials costs for service companies caused expenses to soar at their fastest rate in nearly two years, but service providers only slightly raised their prices in December due to market competition. Optimism about growth in 2017 reached a four-month high, with surveyed companies generally showing more confidence due to improving market conditions and company expansions.    The Caixin China Manufacturing PMI, which was released on Jan 3, hit a 47-month high of 51.9 in December. The strong performance in the two sectors meant the Caixin Composite Output Index, which reflects performance in both sectors, hit a 45-month high of 53.5 in December from November\\\\\\'s 52.9. Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, an investment research firm, says the figures show continued recovery in China\\\\\\'s economy. \"The Chinese economy performed better in the fourth quarter than in the previous three quarters. There is no question that the government full year growth target will be reached,\" Zhong says. China\\\\\\'s GDP grew at 6.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2016, the government target being between 6.5 and 7 percent for the year.

His wide range of interests reflects the extraordinary range of businesses of the $40 billion (38 billion euros; 32.4 billion) technology and manufacturing giant, from aerospace to electronic control technologies for buildings, homes and turbochargers, to high-performance materials. But Adamczyk, 50, who is to be the new CEO starting at the end of March, is pushing for even more changes in his group. He is determined to take the company to even higher heights of involvement in the digital age.   Darius Adamczyk, CEO-in-waiting of Honeywell, will take office in March. Provided to China Daily  On his recent trips to China, Adamczyk talked to his Chinese teams about how the multinational will achieve more growth by blending its strengths in hardware with a stronger presence in software in the digital age. He encouraged them to create new ideas as startups rather than in an established industrial conglomerate. He believes the place to achieve such breakthroughs is in China, Honeywell\\\\\\'s second-largest market after the United States. Adamczyk is clear about how committed Honeywell is to the country - with its major presence, 13,000 employees and diversified businesses in manufacturing and research and development, which serves both Chinese and international markets. Honeywell wants to be viewed as a local player, working at the brisk performance level that has been achieved by many domestic companies, he says. \"When I think about China, I can\\\\\\'t think of a company that\\\\\\'s more aligned to the needs of where the country is heading,\" he says, citing the key areas of energy conservation, energy solutions, clean air and water, smart buildings, chemicals and work safety. Recently he spoke with China Daily about the company\\\\\\'s strategy and business opportunities in China. The following are edited excerpts from the interview. Q: What are your strategies for the company in the long term? A: No 1 is to continue to provide superior value to our customers, and No 2 is to drive digitalization throughout Honeywell. We have a strong presence in software but we have a lot more opportunities to drive it. All aspects of our business are very customer-centric. I want to make sure that we operate in segments that are exciting and growing, and well-aligned with mega trends. How are you going to blend software programming with Honeywell\\\\\\'s existing physical products? Honeywell has been developing in internet of things, and we have access to data. Honeywell is the company that has those products that actually generate that data. However, we\\\\\\'ve used that information just to make the basically functional products. We now aim to integrate the data with information across the whole installation base that we have, and across all our products, and to think about our customers\\\\\\' challenges differently. We now have opportunities to redefine how we create new value for our customers through our software capability, installation base and domain knowledge. What do you think are the most challenging issues in making Honeywell more flexible and nimble in the internet era? Speed is something that\\\\\\'s going to separate the winners from losers. And in this new industrial software - and certainly one of the things that I\\\\\\'m trying to enable in Honeywell - it\\\\\\'s important for us to be able to operate and come up with ideas at a whole different rate of speed than ever before. What\\\\\\'s your definition of a breakthrough? I\\\\\\'m never satisfied with the current speed of growth. When we think of growth, I think about it as continuing to gain a share in our core markets, but also coming up with adjacent strategies that will enhance our overall growth. So I\\\\\\'m pushing and driving the organization to be more creative, to think about our offerings differently, to rethink what breakthrough growth means and to take the time to set metrics and expectations to make sure that happens. What kind of incentives are you going to offer to your employees to be creative and develop new products and new applications? I am encouraging all of our businesses to create new ideas and new organizational structures, to create new small businesses. I want them to operate like startups. So I want to remove a lot of bureaucracy and encourage our people and businesses to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward breakthrough initiatives to really drive growth. How do you prioritize your business portfolio to meet this goal? As a new CEO takes over, we can take a look at the markets we are in and the markets we are not in and optimize our operations and where we are today. I really want to align our businesses towards a lot of longer-term global macro trends. But, most important for Honeywell, we have to be in segments where you differentiate yourself by technology. Honeywell is a technology company. How have Honeywell\\\\\\'s Chinese operations performed in the past year, and what are their prospects? They continue to do very well. We\\\\\\'ve had another strong year in China and we are anticipating it to be even stronger in 2017. We have seen a recovery in some areas. One of the more challenging market sectors in China has been the oil and gas segment, due to what\\\\\\'s been happening there. But, overall, it was a very strong year in 2016 and we look forward to an even stronger 2017. You started your career as an engineer. What is your advice to people making the transition from engineering to management? It\\\\\\'s the most challenging thing to make that first transition from being an engineer. In my case, I happened to bridge my engineering career with an MBA, to go into the world of business. But my advice to engineers is to take an assignment outside core engineering. Because the broader understanding you have, the more effectively you can make that progress. You\\\\\\'ve been praised for succeeding in every business leadership role you have ever held. What\\\\\\'s your secret? It\\\\\\'s about having strategies, having a group of people to work with and having the tactics to make sure the strategy is being executed every day, every week, every month, every year. Everybody in the organization should be able to say how they are contributing to that strategy. Then it\\\\\\'s about putting the operational systems in place. And people are critical. What is the most important quality for a leader? As a leader, you have to put a lot of energy and a lot of passion into the business. You have to be the spark that moves the organization. That\\\\\\'s something that I am always trying to do. I think the job of leader is to always set the bar higher, to always challenge the organization. What are your hobbies and interests outside of work? I spend all my spare time with my family. To make sure that you stay really grounded, what\\\\\\'s truly important is your family. wangzhuoqiong@chinadaily.com.cn Bio: Darius Adamczyk Age: 50 Career: March 2017: CEO of Honeywell Current: President and chief operating officer of Honeywell Previous positions include: President and CEO of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies; president of Honeywell Process Solutions; president of Honeywell Scanning & Mobility Senior associate at Booz Allen Hamilton Electrical engineer at General Electric Education: MBA, Harvard University Master\\\\\\'s degree in computer engineering from Syracuse University Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Michigan State University ( China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page31)\\'\\n \\'Recycling industry expands in Beijing as residents demand a door-to-door pickup service In the morning on the first weekend of each month, 28-year-old programmer Liang Tianlong waits patiently for the recycling man to collect his household waste, including paper and bottles. Liang says he\\\\\\'s gotten used to the routine after more than six months. Nowadays, a growing number of Chinese can enjoy services like this, thanks to the development of the online-to-offline waste recycling industry.   - A woman scans and installs an application for the collection of waste in Shanghai. Recycling services using apps are popular in big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. Yang Yi / For China Daily     New Living (Beijing) Information Technology Co is a startup at the heart of the sector, which was established two years ago. It has developed an application that provides a regular door-to-door recycling service for waste - including plastic bottles, cans, paper and old electronic appliances. Having won itself a solid customer base in the capital, New Living is striving to carve out a self-sustaining business model, according to Xia Fan, its CEO. \"As scrap prices are declining, the company\\\\\\'s innovative business model is showing advantages in dealing with the challenge,\" Xia says. Besides recycling, the app also provides e-commerce services, enabling its users to purchase fruit and vegetables online and to hire housekeeping or repair services. Such services are not uncommon on other O2O platforms. But Xia says his company\\\\\\'s increasingly mature logistics system gives it an advantage over competitors. \"When collecting the waste, the worker can also deliver what the clients ordered online. That\\\\\\'s how we reduce costs and improve logistics efficiency,\" Xia adds.    Xia says he believes such \"reverse logistics\" represent a sustainable business model and will add to the returns in the recycling business. To date, New Living has built up a recycling team of more than 300 workers who serve more than 200,000 families in 800 communities in Beijing. The amount of wastepaper New Living recycled in 2016 more than doubled to 6,500 metric tons from the same period the year before. In the same period, the number of plastic bottles and cans processed totaled 36 million, up 38.5 percent from a year earlier. In the past few years, many startups have begun to compete in the industry, especially after the government released a six-year plan on building up a recycling system for renewable resources starting in January 2015. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, China\\\\\\'s top 10 categories of recycling renewable resources in 2015 were worth 514.9 billion yuan ($74 billion; 71.2 billion euros; 60.5 billion). Li Yinan, an analyst at China Co-Harmony Investment Fund Management Co, says companies need to establish a sound and sustainable strategy. \"A door-to-door waste recycling service is demanded by many individuals. That means tremendous market potential ahead,\" Li says. \"For household waste, however, the profit margin is relatively low. O2O startups in this sector need large-scale operations.\" Tian Yuanyuan contributed to this story. jingshuiyu@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page29)\\'\\n \\'Editor\\\\\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. The last month of the lunar calendar used to be called the Hunting Month in more rustic times. That was when traps were set in the wild to catch pheasants, rabbits, deer and wild boar in preparation for the rounds of feasting during the Spring Festival, just weeks away. These days, wild game is no longer easily available so tamer options are used, although the meats are still cured and hung up to dry in the chilly winds. Layue has come to represent a time for preparing and curing meats, known as larou.   - Assorted cured meats form elaborate displays in markets. Photos Provided to China Daily   - Major curing ingredients range from pig liver to poultry, from beef to mutton.   In spite of the urban spread of China\\\\\\'s population, the year-end tradition of preserving meat is still popular, with a variety of birds, cuts of beef, mutton, pork and fish strung up in backyards and on balconies to catch the winter wind and sun. Let\\\\\\'s start from the southern end of the country where Cantonese cured meats form elaborate displays at New Year\\\\\\'s markets. Sausages are made from hand-cut belly pork and marinated in salt, plenty of sugar and quality Chinese yellow wine, which gives the links their characteristic red tinge. This is also the time when fresh duck or goose livers are marinated in spices, sugar and wine and stuffed into intestines. These, unlike the meat sausages, are seasonal delicacies only available for a limited time. Another uniquely Cantonese cured product is a whole pig liver, hollowed out and stuffed with a piece of pork fat. Surprisingly, they are not hard to eat. The liver turns firm during the curing process, while the fat turns crisp and transparent. The Cantonese cook steams, then cuts these liver sausages into very thin slivers, serving them on slices of steamed arrowroot or yam. More familiar are whole ducks which are spatchcocked, spiced and salted. The intensely savory birds will be a highlight on the reunion table on Lunar New Year\\\\\\'s Eve. Surprisingly, chicken is cooked fresh and seldom cured in the southern regions. Duck thigh fillets are now more popular with the modern generation, as traditions change with the shrinking size of families. These deep maroon nuggets are easily cut up and even easier to steam and there are no bony bits to contend with.    Further north, in Yunnan and Sichuan, various cuts of meat are heavily seasoned and hung up to dry, ending up in stir-fries or simply steamed. Here, the meats are pickled with lots of chilli and Sichuan peppercorns. Local sausages are also very spicy, and they leach a bright red oil when they are fried, sending out a fragrance that is irresistible to the homesick Sichuan native. Near the central plains and the lake regions just to the south, soy sauce is a major curing ingredient and sauce-cured strips of meat are already hanging up to dry in many backyards. Poultry, such as duck, goose or chicken, is also steeped in sauce. In Ningbo, a favorite New Year\\\\\\'s delicacy is a sort of ham, with chopped pork stuffed into a pig\\\\\\'s stomach and then cured in brine. In Hubei, where there are plenty of lakes and ponds, preparation for spring must start with fishing for carp. Whole carp are salted and then hung up to dehydrate but a good cured carp stays soft and supple for the New Year\\\\\\'s meals. As we move farther north, the nomadic influences come into play and the main ingredients change to beef and mutton, and the style becomes more like jerky. Whole sheep are cured and beef is cut and dried in easy-to-transport strips. Beef jerky is still popular with horsemen driving flocks. These days, however, they have become favorite snacks for the keyboard generation, who buy them from online supermarkets that deliver to the door. Strips of cured meat or tiny cubes individually wrapped are all best-sellers. The Hunting Month may have slowly evolved into the curing month, but it is still part of a culinary tradition that is a prelude to the most important celebration of the entire lunar year. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn Making sausages the Cantonese way Prepare sausage casings These natural pig intestines are heavily salted to preserve them, and you need to soak them for a day or two to make them supple again. Once they are soft, you have to gently run water through them to make sure there are no leaks. I often \"sterilize\" them by pushing fat cloves of garlic down the entire length. Cutting the meat The best ratio of fat to lean is about 70 percent marbled meat to 30 percent fat, which must be hand-cut into the smallest dices. It is the fat that keeps the sausages moist. Marbled meat is softer, with fat lacing the leaner fibers. These cuts are normally on the upper shoulders and thighs. Hand-cutting the meat is important if you want to control the texture. You can mince the meat but it means a more mealy and dense sausage after curing. Once the meats are prepared, mix them up thoroughly so there are jewels of fat studded throughout.    The marinade Salt, sugar and Chinese five-spice powder are dissolved in a dark soy sauce and Chinese yellow wine mixture. You must be able to smell the fragrance of the wine, so a quality product must be chosen. I also add a couple spoonfuls of strong white liqueur to aid the preservation. You can use vodka as a substitute. Taste. If you\\\\\\'re happy with the balance of flavors, it\\\\\\'s time to add the meat. Mix it all really well and let it sit for an hour for the meat to absorb the marinade. Stuffing the sausages Open up the sausage casing and push it up the narrow end of a funnel. Hold on to the casing as you push the meat through the funnel. If you are a beginner, work on shorter, more manageable lengths. Always check that your sausages are not split or leaking. Twist them into the lengths you want and then hang them on a bamboo pole. You can cure them on the balcony where the cold will soon dry them up. Remember to place a tray beneath the links to catch the dripping fat, otherwise your neighborhood pets will soon be congregating on your balcony or in your backyard. The links will be wrinkled and ready in about three weeks and you can then transfer them to the refrigerator. Steam them, or cut them up to fry.

However, he complained that the Tao Tie in Zhang\\\\\\'s film were not \"Chinese\" monsters. \"They look like Western ones with Chinese names. They have more in common with monsters from Hollywood films, such as Godzilla,\" says Gu, a programmer in Beijing who loves monster movies. Gu is not the only one to feel this way. Many Chinese netizens say that as the Tao Tie is seen as one of the four evil creatures - and is believed to be the offspring of a dragon, according Chinese mythology - it should have been portrayed as a single beast, instead of hoards of ant-like beasts in the film.   - Monsters are typically Westernized, like the one portrayed in the 2015 Chinese fantasy film Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe. Photos Provided to China Daily   - A dragon designed by Gino Acevedo with wings and a body inspired by sea horses.   But the complaints are not only about Tao Tie. Chinese people have long complained that monsters portrayed in domestic movies look like those in Western films. That\\\\\\'s not surprising, since many were created by Western companies. The Tao Tie in Zhang\\\\\\'s film, which is based on the Chinese literary work Classic of Mountains and Seas, has been created by the New Zealand company Weta Workshop. Gao Xia, a concept designer with Weta Workshop, who worked on rendering Tao Tie, says: \"Chinese monsters are very different from their Western counterparts. It is also more difficult to portray Chinese monsters on screen because of the cultural factor.\" Pointing out some of the challenges involved in creating Chinese monsters, he says that, for example, the eyes of Tao Tie must be under the arms according to mythology. However, in the film they are moved to the neck. Referring to Hollywood creatures, he says: \"They must be anatomically perfect. The veins of the monster, the color of its skin, the muscles and even the parasites in them must make sense.\" Another problem with creating Chinese versions, he says, is that ancient paintings that portray Chinese monsters often use clouds and fire, and many monsters from folk tales and mythology only exist in the written form, making them difficult to portray. \"Just like Chinese ink paintings, we put more stress on imagination,\" says Gao. Speaking about the difference between monsters from the East and West, Gino Acevedo, who has been involved in the creation of monsters for films like The Lord of The Rings, The Hobbit and Alien, says Eastern culture is fond of the powers of supernatural beings, while the West turns to nature for inspiration. Acevedo himself is a good example of a monster expert inspired by nature. His favorite TV shows were all about animals. He loves lizards and snakes so much that he once raised more than 30 kinds of snakes and lizards in his bedroom. The dragons he now designs are based on these reptiles. His monsters often have sharp teeth or long tusks, which he says are inspired by crocodiles. \"I think ghosts and monsters from the East are more scary. They are supernatural. And, sometimes, even though they do not have eyes, they still know where you are.\" When it comes to the creatures that he finds memorable, he says that the ghosts and monsters from A Chinese Ghost Story, produced by Hong Kong director Tsui Hark, impressed many Westerners. The film is about a love story between a young man and a female ghost. Referring to the size of the monsters, Acevedo says that those in the East have the same proportions as human beings, but monsters in Western films typically have bigger bodies to show that they are not humans. Acevedo says that, although the West has a long history creating monsters on screen, China can find ideas from its own rich mythology. Gao says that after working with Western companies he feels it is now time for him and his Chinese peers in the film industry to look more closely at Chinese culture. He says this is because if you want to create a monster to meet local tastes you need cultural context. This view is supported by Yan Dingxian, 80, creator of the Monkey King and monsters in the animated film Havoc in Heaven, which was made in the 1960s. He says that it is a deep understanding of Chinese cultural elements like Peking Opera, mythologies and martial arts that made the movie popular with Chinese audiences at the time. dengzhangyu@chinadaily.com.cn   - A fish-like monster from the folk tale Madam White Snake created by Chinese artist Wu Jian\\\\\\'an.

In many cases - especially when the patient\\\\\\'s condition is critical - we have to re-evaluate their decision to have a baby and end the pregnancy promptly to save their life.\"   - Mothers-to-be practice yoga at a training institute in Nanchang, Jiangxi province. Photos by Xinhua   - Pregnant women line up for health checks at Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital in Jinan, Shandong province, in March. Thirty percent of mothers-to-be visiting the hospital are expecting their second child, according to hospital sources.   Gu Hong, a pediatrician at the hospital who specializes in treating cardiac disease in babies, warns that the two-child policy could have unintended but far-reaching consequences: \"We are facing some very harsh challenges. Many women are trying their best to have a second child, even if conditions such as cardiac disease could put them at high risk.\" According to Gu, seven pregnant women have died in the hospital in the past five years as a result of cardiac complications, and those risks still exist despite improvements in medical technology. Anzhen Hospital is not alone in facing the challenge. According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission, in the first half of the year China\\\\\\'s maternity mortality rate reached 183 per 1 million people, an increase of more than 30 percent compared with the same period last year. The mortality rate had been declining steadily in China until the end of last year, when the country\\\\\\'s leaders approved the adoption of the universal two-child policy to tackle the problems posed by the nation\\\\\\'s rapidly aging population. As a result, the decadeslong family planning policy, which limited most couples to one child, was relaxed. Last year, the mortality rate during pregnancy fell to 201 per 1 million people, from 300 per 1 million in 2010, according to the commission. But the figure is now rising. \"The rise in the number of pregnant women, particularly those at higher risk, such as older women, resulted in a rise in maternity deaths in some parts of the country in the first half of the year,\" a statement released by the commission in October said. The NHFPC estimates that more than 3 million women at higher risk will become pregnant in China every year between the start of next year and 2020, a rise of 30 percent from the period before the adoption of the two-child policy. \"This will cause increased risks of maternity complications and present challenges to treatment and recovery,\" the commission said. The number of babies born in the first half of the year was 8.31 million, a rise of 6.9 percent over the same period last year, a significant increase despite the declining number of married women of fertile age, it said. In addition, the sudden rise in pregnancies has resulted in maternity services coming under greater strain, and both facilities and hospital personnel are under-resourced, according to the commission. Of the 90 million women now eligible to have a second baby, 60 percent are 35 or older, which means they are considered to be at higher risk during pregnancy, the NHFPC says. Gu says about 150 pregnant patients with cardiac complications were received by Anzhen Hospital last year, compared with approximately 110 in 2011. This year, the number is expected to surpass 180. Acting on traditional beliefs, many women are opting to have another child, according to Gu: \"Many of these patients are seeking treatment and care in our hospital, but not all women are suitable for pregnancy. Women with serious conditions are very likely to give birth to an unhealthy child, and their own lives could also be threatened during childbirth.\"    Liu, the cardiologist, urged older women to assess the risks they face before deciding to have a child. \"With the rise in age, pregnant women have a higher chance of developing illnesses. They must be aware of their physical condition before pregnancy to reduce the risk to them during childbirth,\" she says. He Wenjie, a gynecologist at the reproductive medicine department at Xuzhou Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital, in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, has also seen a rise in the number of older patients: \"The average age of patients I am receiving is rising. It is crucial that all women, especially those who are older, have checkups before pregnancy to reduce the health risk.\" The NHFPC says health authorities will take more measures in the next few years to improve the health of pregnant women, given the rising rates of mortality during pregnancy. Hospitals nationwide will add 89,000 obstetrics beds, and local authorities will upgrade emergency equipment at hospital obstetrics and pediatrics departments. The commission will also select a number of national midwifery training bases and organize training related to the treatment of pregnant women with critical conditions. It will also cooperate with other departments to provide training, with the aim of producing 140,000 extra obstetricians and midwives. wangxiaodong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page20)\\'\\n \\'Titles of Chinese regions are mostly based on logic and geography If there is one quality a good administrator of an empire ought to have it\\\\\\'s knowing where everything is. In early history, the tribes that were the forerunners of the Chinese civilization called their homeland \"the Central Plains\" - defined as the plains in the \"center\" of the various tribes that surrounded them. This name later gave rise to the term zhÅ\\\\x8dnggu¨®, or \"Central Kingdom\", the literal translation of the name of said civilization. The names of many Chinese administrative regions today retain helpful references to directions and geographic features to let you know roughly where they are, for instance, \"south of the river,\" or \"north of the river\".    Easy: Henan (æ²³å\\\\x8d\\\\x97, H¨¦n¨¢n), Hebei (æ²³å\\\\x8c\\\\x97, H¨¦bÄ\\\\x9bi), Hunan (æ¹\\\\x96å\\\\x8d\\\\x97ï¼\\\\x8cHÃºn¨¢n), Hubei (æ¹\\\\x96å\\\\x8c\\\\x97ï¼\\\\x8cHÃºbÄ\\\\x9bi), Shandong (å±±ä¸\\\\x9c, ShÄ\\\\x81ndÅ\\\\x8dng), Shanxi (å±±è¥¿, shÄ\\\\x81nxÄ«) First, brush up on your cardinal directions: ä¸?dÅ\\\\x8dng, east), è¥?(xÄ«, west), å\\\\x8d?(n¨¢n, south), å\\\\x8c?(bÄ\\\\x9bi, north). æ²?(h¨¦) refers to \"river\", æ¹?(hÃº) is \"lake\", and å±?(shÄ\\\\x81n) is \"mountain(s)\". But actually, in ancient times, æ²?was the exclusive name of the Yellow River, the major river of consequence in northern China, whereas your run-of-the-mill tributaries, streams, channels, conduits and waterways would have all been referred to as å·?(chuÄ\\\\x81n, as in Sichuan, \"four rivers\"). That more or less gives away the answer to the first pair of provinces: Henan and Hebei are regions (and later provinces) north and south of the Yellow River. Hunan and Hubei are likewise north and south of the lake, which in this case is Dongting Lake. The mountains referred to in Shandong and Shanxi, on the other hand, are open to some dispute. They could refer to the Taihang Mountains, which are located between Shanxi and Hebei province (but not present-day Shandong), Xiao Mountain in present-day Henan province, or Mount Hua in Shanxi. It could also refer to all of these mountains, as up until the Qing dynasty \"Shandong\" referred to a much larger region roughly comprising the plains around the eastern section of the Yellow River, east of the \"mountains,\" generally speaking, that were found north of the Central Plains. Moderate: Guangxi (å¹¿è¥¿, GuÇ\\\\x8engxÄ«), Guangdong (å¹¿ä¸\\\\x9c, GuÇ\\\\x8engdÅ\\\\x8dng), Jiangxi (æ±\\\\x9fè¥¿, JiÄ\\\\x81ngxÄ«) These province names also include cardinal directions, but no clear geographic marker. The å¹?(guÇ\\\\x8eng) in Guangxi Autonomous Region and Guangdong province literally means \"wide\", but the name of the region traces itself to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty in the 2nd century BC. During his reign, the Han conquered the southern kingdom of Nanyue (å\\\\x8d\\\\x97è¶\\\\x8a, also known as Southern Yue), focused around the present-day city of Guangzhou. According to ancient historians, at this time Emperor Wu said: \"å\\\\x88\\\\x9då¼\\\\x80ç²¤å\\\\x9c°å®\\\\x9cå¹¿å¸\\\\x83æ\\\\x81©ä¿?(as we develop the Yue region, we must widely broadcast favor and trust).\" The characters å¹?and ä¿?quote gave rise to the name to the new regional capital Guangxin, and the entire region of present-day Guangdong and Guangxi came to be called \"Guangzhou\" after this city. In the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the road leading to this region had two branches called \"Guangxi South Road\" and \"Guangdong South Road,\" which gave the two present-day administrative regions their names. Jiangxi also has many confusing explanations. In ancient times the character æ±?(jiÄ\\\\x81ng), for river, belonged like æ²?exclusively to one river, which in this case is the Yangtze River (é\\\\x95¿æ±\\\\x9f, ch¨¢ngjiÄ\\\\x81ng). Since the Yangtze actually flows through present-day Jiangxi province, it would make sense that Jiangxi refers to the western part of the Yangtze, except Jiangxi is actually located quite far east. Some other explanations are that the æ±?actually refers to the èµ?(gÃ\\\\xa0n) River, another major river in the province. The real answer is that Jiangxi is an abbreviation: for æ±\\\\x9få\\\\x8d\\\\x97è¥¿é\\\\x83¨ (jiÄ\\\\x81ngn¨¢n xÄ«bÃ¹), or \"western part of the Jiangnan region\", the name given to the geographic and cultural area immediately south of the Yangtze. Hard: Shaanxi (é\\\\x99\\\\x95è¥¿, ShÇ\\\\x8enxÄ«), Yunnan (äº\\\\x91å\\\\x8d\\\\x97, YÃºnn¨¢n), Hainan (æµ·å\\\\x8d\\\\x97, HÇ\\\\x8ein¨¢n), Tibet (è¥¿è\\\\x97\\\\x8fï¼\\\\x8cXÄ«zÃ\\\\xa0ng) Like Jiangxi, the names of these provinces and regions also lack a direct counterpart. However, unlike Jiangxi, the reason here is that these names all refer to former Chinese border regions and are named according to their cardinal direction relative to some description of China\\\\\\'s borders, highlighting their status \"outside\" the ancient definition of the homeland; their \"counterpart\" would simply be existing Chinese regions that already had names or more broadly, China itself. Shaanxi, currently home to Xi\\\\\\'an, the former imperial capital of Chang\\\\\\'an, was integrated into the central Chinese civilization early on. However, the name of the region comes from its location west of the Shaan Plateau (é\\\\x99\\\\x95å¡¬, shÇ\\\\x8enyu¨¢n) in present-day Shaan county, Henan province, and was decidedly a frontier region of the Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC), which was based around the Central Plains. In around the 9th century BC, the region became the seat of the Qin Kingdom, one of the Warring States, which was considered by the other states to be a western border-region upstart beneath their notice. As we now know, the Qin exploited this advantage and conquered all the other states to become the Qin Empire, the first Chinese empire, and with this the former frontier of Shaanxi and the Qin capital of Chang\\\\\\'an became the new Chinese heartland. The names of Yunnan and Hainan both connote places that, in ancient times, were really, incredibly, unimaginably far away. Yunnan literally means \"South of the Clouds\", and that is the actual origin of the name: it was the mysterious region south of the cloud-shrouded mountains that marked the southwestern boundary of the ancient Chinese civilization, but a more colorful legend states that one day, Emperor Wu of Han saw iridescent clouds on top of a mountain and ordered his servant to follow it. When the servant reported back that he found land south of those clouds, Emperor Wu named it \"Yunnan\". Hainan, on the other hand, comes from Hainan Island and the name means \"South of the Sea\", and was among many folk names that the island used to go by in ancient times including \"southern extremity\" (å\\\\x8d\\\\x97æ\\\\x9e\\\\x81, n¨¢nj¨ª), \"edge of the sea\" (æµ·è§\\\\x92, hÇ\\\\x8eijiÇ\\\\x8eo), and \"edge of the sky\" (å¤©æ¶¯, tiÄ\\\\x81ny¨¢). \"Xizang\", finally, has several explanations: the character è\\\\x97?(zÃ\\\\xa0ng) itself is said to be a transliteration of a Tibetan word for the region populated by the Tibetan ethnic group, which also included present-day parts of Sichuan and Qinghai provinces. \"Xi\", however, comes from a slightly different origin, as part of the general name that Chinese empires since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) gave to their western border regions (è¥¿å\\\\x9f\\\\x9f, xÄ«yÃ¹). Expert level: Guandong (å\\\\x85³ä¸\\\\x9c, GuÄ\\\\x81ndÅ\\\\x8dng); all provincial abbreviations Guandong, not to be confused with Guangdong, was the old name for the northeastern region of China, which in English today is still called \"Manchuria\" (a name first created by French missionaries). The name referred to the region\\\\\\'s position east (but mostly north) of the passes on the Great Wall, through which the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) eventually entered China and integrated the region into the Chinese homeland.

He wanted to have a hand in designing homes for local villages as well. Fuyang is located about an hour\\\\\\'s drive from Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and sits on the north bank of the Fuchun River, a place renowned for its natural beauty. Earlier this year, it became a district under the city of Hangzhou.   - A view of the roof of the Gongwang Art Museum. The building is part of an arts complex that houses an archive and another museum.   - The architecture of the Gongwang Art Museum blends traditional Chinese elements with modern aesthetics. Photos Provided to China Daily   The local administration promptly agreed to Wang\\\\\\'s request. The prospect of securing the services of this famous figure in the architecture world was reason enough to do so. In a display of just how much they revered Wang, the local authorities dedicated a prime piece of land near a mountain and by a river for the arts center. Should that piece of land in this location be used for real estate development today, it would be valued at a staggering 1 billion yuan ($150 million; 142.6 billion euros; 5121.5 billion). Such was Wang\\\\\\'s influence. The arts center will comprise three buildings - Gongwang Art Museum, Fuyang Archives and Fuyang Museum - all of which will be designed by Wang. The Gongwang Art Museum is already open to public, while the other two segments are still under construction. Wang, 53, is the first Chinese person to win the world\\\\\\'s top prize in architecture. Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, he is currently dean of the School of Architecture at the China Academy of Art. A lover of traditional art, Wang grew up in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, where his mother worked as a schoolteacher. During the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76), when schools across the country were shuttered, teachers and many others were forced to become farmers. As a young boy, Wang enjoyed working in the fields as it enabled him to feel a connection with the earth. He said that he also found fulfillment in physical labor. Wang loved reading and had fortuitous access to a range of books censored by the government when his mother was transferred from the fields to become a librarian. When he was 10, Wang moved to Xi\\\\\\'an, Shaanxi province, where tents were used as classrooms. He later witnessed how the locals would build new classrooms and was fascinated with the bamboo frameworks used in the construction process. As Wang was passionate about art and engineering, he decided to study architecture at Southeast University because he thought the discipline was a perfect blend of the two. He describes himself as a rebellious undergraduate who was always ready to challenge professors. Wang even wrote a thesis criticizing modern Chinese architecture. A keen lover of traditional Chinese art, with a particular interest in ancient gardens and landscape paintings, Wang was eager to incorporate the aesthetics and building techniques of such places into his own creations. But he was perhaps too far ahead of his time, because no one on China\\\\\\'s architectural scene acknowledged or understood his ideas. For several years following his graduation, Wang had no commissions to work on. He said it was his wife, Lu Wenyu, who smoothed the rough edges of his personality. In 1997, the two of them founded the Amateur Architecture Studio. In his new book How To Build House, Wang pays tribute to his wife, conceding that \"for the first seven years of our married life, it was her who supported me\". The couple lived an idyllic life in Hangzhou where they would often stroll along West Lake and had plenty of time to spend sipping tea with friends. Wang says this calming experience nurtured his heart and in turn evoked a change in his perspective on life. \"You could spend a long time watching the rain, how it falls along the ridges of a building, how the streams flow and where the water drops. All this interests you. You would be thinking if it is possible to design architecture and show clearly where the rain comes from, where it flows, where it goes ... each turn and change in movement touches one\\\\\\'s heart,\" he says. Wang\\\\\\'s unique style was eventually recognized and he was presented with the opportunity to design the Ningbo Museum in Zhejiang province. Construction of the museum, which featured the use of bricks salvaged from old buildings that were demolished to make way for modern developments, took place between 2004 and 2008. Wang said he approached the structure as if creating a landscape painting.    \"Looking at the museum from afar, you see the building as a painting of a mountain that is spreading out right in front of your eyes. When entering the structure, you\\\\\\'ll find different landscapes at different positions, offering different perspectives. This is how traditional Chinese landscape paintings should be experienced, through free shifts of perspective and angles,\" Wang says. After this project, Wang was a part of the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, for which he designed the Tengtou Village Pavilion, inspired by a painting of a mountain dwelling by Chen Hongshou (1599-1652). He says that stepping into the doorway of the pavilion is akin to entering a cave where different landscapes unfold at every step, like \"a page in an ancient leaflet of small paintings\". Wang also gained international recognition for designing a building on the Xiangshan Campus of the China Art Academy in suburban Hangzhou. In 2012, Wang received the accolade that most people in his profession can only dream of. He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker jury praised his \"unique ability to evoke the past, without making direct references to history\", while calling his work \"timeless, deeply rooted in its context and yet universal\". Wang describes his approach as a combination of ancient aesthetics with modern utility. As an architect working in contemporary China, he believes that \"one has the opportunity to create something great, something lasting longer than his own life span.\" For the Fuyang project, Wang was determined to reignite the ancient Chinese admiration for mountains and rivers which embodies a unique Chinese philosophy about seeking a life that is in harmony with nature. This was why he specified his unusual condition about designing homes for local villagers. Together with employees from Amateur Architecture Studio and students from the China Art Academy, Wang visited 290 villages in the area to inspect old houses and become immersed in the traditional way of life. He says that nature plays an integral role in the simple yet charming way of life in such areas which is today on the verge of extinction. He laments how many of the homes being built in the country today are soulless \"American-style big villas\" or \"fake antiques\" with white walls and gray tiles. Wang used the smaller residential structures in the village as a canvas for experimentating with ideas. He used stones, old tiles and materials usually considered worthless to construct new village homes and this process helped him determine what he would do for the design of the Gongwang Art Museum. While the museum might be large, its imposing size is tempered by the roof\\\\\\'s long and soft curves which are reminiscent of the mountain ridges in the distance. But not everyone is in awe of Wang\\\\\\'s creations. Some have raised concerns about leakage issues, high maintenance and how his buildings are too distinctive in style, drawing attention away from the exhibits on display. However, Li Lei, director of China Art Museum Shanghai, begs to differ, saying that a fine piece of architecture of the kind Wang has created is \"a bold challenge to pragmatism\". \"The building itself is a piece of art. ... Apart from the skyscrapers that are mushrooming all over China, the country needs architecture for aesthetic appreciation and spiritual fulfillment, too,\" says Li. \"As the nation\\\\\\'s ideas develop in tandem with economic growth, there will be cultural awakening, and people will soon be able to appreciate great architecture.\" zhangkun@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page21)\\'\\n \\'By Chris â\\\\x80\\\\x9cKikilaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Perrin In what can only be described as a case that defies the idea of freedom of the press, CTV News reported... \\'\\n \\'Trump was defending the Russian President after Fox\\\\\\'s Bill O\\\\\\'Reilly called Putin a \"killer.\" His response, \"You think our country is so innocent,\" reveals Trump\\\\\\'s dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody. Clearly, the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history, but the country\\\\\\'s guiding principles have remained unchanged: the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals. In Russia, by contrast, Putin has decimated the opposition, imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government. The free press is a faint shadow of its former self, and Putin\\\\\\'s critics, including journalists, continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances. One of Putin\\\\\\'s most vocal critics, Vladimir Kara-Murza, remains in a Moscow hospital in \"grave condition\" after suffering a \"full organ failure\" that, as his lawyer told CNN, doctors agree is the result of a \"toxic substance.\" Despite Trump\\\\\\'s comments and recent executive actions, Trump should expect push-back from a country committed to liberal democratic principles. This division between the President and the American people makes the United States the latest battleground in a worldwide clash of ideologies. When the wave of populist authoritarianism started, few would have expected the United States, the principal beacon of modern democracy for over 200 years, to fall under the spell of nativist politics. But fall it did. The many Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and now find themselves protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone. On Sunday, while the American public was rapt in the Super Bowl, an astonishing sight came into focus in Romania. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption. The remarkable part was that protesters had already won. Demonstrations had begun six days earlier, after the government tried to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed from prison people convicted of corruption for amounts less than $47,000. The government agreed to rescind the order. But the demonstrations only grew, with protesters saying they came out to protect their democracy. Romanians knew they had to fight for democracy because of their recent communist past and the onslaught in neighboring countries against liberal democracy, which requires separation of powers, a free judiciary, free and fair elections and, yes, freedom to protest. Sadly, now, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the surge of refugee arrivals, demagogic politicians have leveraged popular discontent, lashing out against foreigners, vowing to put their country\\\\\\'s \"true\" residents first, and gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy. Romanians seem to have won round one. But the forces defending democracy elsewhere, including in neighboring Hungary, have been losing. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly declared he\\\\\\'s building an \"illiberal state,\" and is making strides in his quest to imitate regimes run by the likes of Putin. Democratic freedoms have suffered sharp reverses in recent years. Turkey is slipping into dictatorship, Venezuela remains mired in autocracy, as do countries in every continent. But what\\\\\\'s ahead for the United States? Some veterans of the battle are pessimistic. When millions of mostly women took to the streets the day after Trump\\\\\\'s inauguration, Julia Ioffe, whose family fled Russia, threw cold water on their jubilant movement, tweeting, \"The happy, feisty crowds, the clever signs - it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011. That went nowhere.\" It\\\\\\'s true that protests have not achieved much against other authoritarian regimes. In Venezuela, the Chavista regime came to power in 1999, and despite every effort from a determined opposition, it remains in power. In Turkey, mass demonstrations, and even what seemed like electoral victories, have failed to stop Recep Tayyip Erdogan\\\\\\'s march to de facto dictator. In Russia, Putin is all but unchallenged, with a quiescent legislature and near-complete control of the news Russians consume. But the story is likely to have a different outcome in the United States. Yascha Mounk, a Harvard expert in right-wing populism, observed that Trump is turning out to be \"more authoritarian than I feared,\" though the opposition is also proving \"more courageous than I expected.\" America has deeper democratic roots than any of the countries whose liberal democracies has been toppled. The national religion is freedom from tyranny. The day after Trump took office, Americans put on what may have been the largest national demonstration in the country\\\\\\'s history. A week later, when Trump issued his travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries, spontaneous demonstrations materialized at major airports across the country. Lawyers filed legal briefs on the spot. While the Republican-controlled Congress has proven mostly silent in countering Trump\\\\\\'s attacks on the independent media and the judiciary, the press appears determined to do its job and judges seem unintimidated by White House bullying. Even members of the executive branch are speaking out. Many Americans support Trump, but there are signs that his sharp break with democratic traditions, his attacks on judges, his fulminations against the media and against critics of all stripes -- from comedians to restaurant reviewers -- are producing a backlash. History is being written by two opposing forces -- those fighting for and those fighting against liberal democracy. President Trump\\\\\\'s likening of America to Putin\\\\\\'s Russia puts him on the illiberal side. But the American people have spent hundreds of years building a strong democratic system, and they are prepared to fight to defend it.\\'\\n \\'Rejuvenated area in Zhejiang province is using its most famous attraction - Qiandao Lake - to bring in the visitors Waking up to birds chirping and a gentle breeze blowing is one of the pleasures of living near Zhejiang\\\\\\'s tourism hot spot Qiandao Lake.

Fang Chaoxi, in his 20s, is one of the younger generation who quit his white-collar job in Hangzhou and returned to set up an inn in the mountainous Pinghu village, which is just five minutes from the Qiandao Lake zone, in 2013. \"I decided that it was better for me to be my own boss,\" says Fang. His instincts have been proved right, and business is brisk. Now his business brings in roughly 600,000 yuan ($86,335; 69,944) a year. His guests come mostly from Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang. \"Most of my guests stay for around four days and just lie back and enjoy themselves,\" says Fang. Now, the village has roughly 40 inns developed by locals which can accommodate more than 700 visitors at a time. Local inn owners mostly promote their business online and the local offerings are very popular with the visitors. \"They enjoy the local cuisine, the fishing and fruit picking,\" says Fang. The village\\\\\\'s white loquats are a specialty and the annual output could be worth as much as 13.6 million yuan, according to local authorities. Other young people have also returned since Fang came back. \"I was the first who returned, but now there are enough of us to play mahjong,\" says Fang. Meanwhile, driving through the county, we find well-paved roads lined with colorful plants as the local government has spent 1.6 billion yuan to develop green belts across Chun\\\\\\'an. Those belts extend to all villages in the region, with tea and fruit parks all over. All those belts run 350 kilometers through the county, making it easier for cycling, hiking and public transportation. \"They are lined with green plants,\" says Jiang. Improved infrastructure has also helped boost the development of the surrounding villages that used to be cut off. Feng Bo, who gave up his chemical business in Hangzhou\\\\\\'s Xiaoshan district, and moved to Taoyuanlingjia village to start a fruit plantation three years ago, says: \"It used to take a whole day for us to travel to downtown Chun\\\\\\'an earlier. But now the distance has been shortened to just 40-minute drive.\" Feng\\\\\\'s plantation produces 50 fruits, including peaches and kiwis. \"Visitors can pick seasonal fruits throughout the year,\" he says. More than 10,000 visitors have been to his facility so far this year and the income from fruit picking has topped one million yuan. Feng also offers dining and barbecue facilities, and wooden villas are available for those who want to spend the night. Feng is now planning to build an open-air exercise facility. His business has also created job opportunities for locals. Among the things that makes him happy are his good relationship with the locals and the changes he has been able to bring about in the local environment. \"Everything was dirty and chaotic when I first came here, but now every household cleans up their own mess and keeps things in order,\" he says. A sewage system was also set up to treat waste water in the area, thanks to support from the government, he adds. Taoyuanlingjia is just one example of the transformation taking place in Chun\\\\\\'an. Jiang says that so far, the local government has spent approximately 2 billion yuan to develop a sewage system and roads in the area, and modern toilets have been built across the county. \"So, all sewage is treated to ensure clean water and soil,\" he says. Animal waste is also being taken care of. Locals have benefited from improving tourism and have thus began to protect the greenery. \"Preserving water resources matters for Zhejiang, and a tourism-led development model is the ideal way out,\" he adds. yangfeiyue@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page22)\\'\\n \\'Stanford freshman Emily Wang Ziyi had a high SAT score, was a student union president and enjoyed reading, writing, calligraphy, music and jogging. But what really helped the 18-year-old get into the elite US university was something more rare: her potential to be an international golf star. \"Emily is the epitome of a student-athlete,\" said Stanford golf head coach Anne Walker. \"She has pursued an extremely rigorous academic schedule in Beijing and, at the same time, traveled internationally to compete in the best golf events.\" Many Chinese families with children who play golf were also overjoyed at Stanford\\\\\\'s decision, but for a more practical reason. For them, a golf scholarship from such a prestigious US university is another testimonial affirming a unique strategy of college preparation that centers on the game as a scholarship vehicle.   - Pupils attend a gold training class at a golf school in Shanghai. The school, established in 2015, specializes in golf training for adolescents. Gao Erqiang / China Daily  In the past few years, dozens of Chinese students have played golf on US sports scholarships that were won after years of hard training and with considerable parental investment of money and time. The trend has accelerated since 2015 and there is now a bigger crop ripe for the picking, with almost 20 students from the Chinese mainland signing with golf programs at universities including Stanford, Princeton, the University of Southern California, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley, according to the American Junior Golf Association, which tracks students\\\\\\' commitments to college offers. While Wang is the youngest ever to win the China LPGA Tour, several others have the same, if not more illustrious, golf resumes, despite their youthfulness. They include University of Florida freshman Andy Zhang who, at the age of 14, was the youngest golfer ever to compete in the US Open. He Muni, who was born in Chengdu, known for amateur appearances at pro events and top junior finishes. She will compete on the USC women\\\\\\'s team in the spring. Most of the teens learned the game at a young age, with their fathers as their first teacher. All have come from upper-middle-class families, since training and competition are expensive. Wang\\\\\\'s mother, Liu Yan, who advocates golf as a steppingstone to US universities, says she had devoted all her time to her daughter as her cook, driver and chaperon. Her father trained with her during weekends and took leave to be her caddie at important competitions. However, Liu says she believes that extraordinary self-discipline was the key to her daughter\\\\\\'s success. Likewise, Dan Webb, CEO of Palm Springs Golf, an academy for local children in southern Shenzhen, says he believes young Chinese golfers\\\\\\' greatest advantage is their way of thinking. \"The Chinese philosophy produces an extreme work ethic, focus and humility,\" he says. \"When circumstance allows self-confidence to be introduced within this philosophy, you have the making of a serious golf player, perhaps a champion.\" Luo Ying caused a stir in Seattle in 2013 when she played for the University of Washington while maintaining a 4.0 grade point average.

In the past few years, China\\\\\\'s railway network, especially high-speed lines, has undergone dramatic change. He Junyi / For China Daily  Over the past few years, China\\\\\\'s railway network, especially high-speed rail, has undergone dramatic change. From 2011 to 2015, China invested 3.58 trillion yuan to build 30,000 km of railway. By the end of this year, the nation\\\\\\'s total railway length will reach 124,000 km, including 20,000 km of high-speed railway, accounting for 65 percent of the world\\\\\\'s total high-speed rail. In July, the National Development and Reform Commission issued an updated national railway development plan envisioning a 175,000-km rail network by the end of 2025, with 38,000 km of high-speed rail. However, the network still faces challenges, especially in the less-developed western part of China. Yang says he is confident that lines in western China will eventually become profitable. \"Plus, building high-speed railways in less-developed regions is not only about recouping investment. It is part of the big project of rejuvenating the whole region and the country\\\\\\'s economy. The high-speed rail linking Beijing and Shanghai showed a profit last year, Xinhua News Agency reported in July, quoting Tianjin Railway Construction Co, a shareholder of Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Co. Yang Hao, a professor of rail transportation at Beijing Jiaotong University, says the economic returns of a high-speed railway network shouldn\\\\\\'t be judged solely on whether lines are profitable, since these railways can leverage the development of such industries as tourism, logistics and real estate. According to China Railway Corp, construction began on Dec 29 on a high-speed line linking Guiyang, Guizhou province - a transportation hub connecting members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -and Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. The 482-km line will connect the Shanghai-Kunming railway and the Chengdu-Guiyang railway to the north, and will also link to southern coastal areas including Hainan province and Guangzhou, Guangdong province. The new will accelerate communication between China and ASEAN countries and play an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative.

In recent years the Chinese government has made great efforts to improve food safety. But while it has been constantly improving, many problems remain, Xi said. He urged authorities at all levels to adhere to \"the strictest standards\" for \"the strictest supervision\" of food safety, and the imposition of punishments of greater severity for those guilty of endangering it. China will also build a professional team of food safety inspectors and improve law enforcement capacity at the grassroots level to improve safety at every link, he said. Premier Li Keqiang also urged local governments to give priority to ensuring the safety of the food chain and improving supervision mechanisms. Improving safety should start at the source, and irregularities must be severely punished, he said. Zhang Gaoli, vice-premier and head of the Food Safety Commission of the State Council, China\\\\\\'s Cabinet, said China\\\\\\'s food safety situation is stable in general but at the same time challenging and complex. Zhang spoke while hosting a commission meeting on Jan 3. He urged authorities across China to adopt strict measures to fight irregularities, including improving legislation, such as considering criminal punishments in cases of food adulteration and fake food products. Zhang also urged authorities to release the 13th Five-Year Plan for Food Safety (2016-20) and increase investment in safety supervision and law enforcement. The integrity of food production systems has been a major concern for the Chinese people, especially after a severe case of melamine adulteration in 2008, in which thousands of infants across China were sickened and four died after ingesting melamine-tainted infant formula made by Sanlu Group, a leading domestic dairy operator. Melamine, a chemical used in plastics, was used to make it appear that the products contained high protein. Food safety ranked at the top of a list of 10 safety issues that most worry Chinese, according to a survey released by Xiaokang magazine and Tsinghua University in July. In January, the China Food and Drug Administration published a list of 35 catering companies that used opium, banned as a food additive, in their dishes. The list included some famous chain restaurants. China has seen improvements since it adopted its revised Food Safety Law in 2015. Tests showed that 96.8 percent of samples met standards in 2015, an increase of 2.1 percentage points compared with the previous year, according to a report by law enforcement teams dispatched by the National People\\\\\\'s Congress, China\\\\\\'s top legislature. The report was based on inspections in 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The report also noted that food safety in China still faces major challenges, including lack of law enforcement capacity at the grassroots level caused by lack of equipment and talent. And many testing institutes in China lack adequate capacity for food inspections and testing. wangxiaodong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page15)\\'\\n \\'Recent government guideline will lower entry hurdles in wide range of fields China is opening more sectors to foreign investment and introducing a slew of measures to invite participation, top officials say. The State Council\\\\\\'s executive meeting on Dec 28, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, approved a new guideline to further attract foreign investment and advance China\\\\\\'s opening-up. \"We should take measures with great effectiveness in attracting foreign capital,\" Li said. Under the new guideline, foreign investment access hurdles will be dropped in a number of manufacturing sectors, including rail transportation, motorbikes and ethanol fuels. Foreign capital will have access to fields like energy, water conservancy, environmental protection and utilities via franchise agreements. \"China\\\\\\'s economy develops as we continue our opening-up strategy. Besides advanced technology and experience in management, China also needs capital investment from overseas,\" Li said.    The catalog for industrial access for foreign investors also will be amended to match the new measures. Foreign capital will be encouraged to enter high-end manufacturing, as well as related services, such as industrial design and logistics. Accounting and auditing, architecture design and rating services will be open to foreign investment for the first time. Foreign-funded companies will be cleared to join the national science and technology program as equals with domestic ones, and enjoy favorable policies under the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy. The guideline emphasizes equal treatment for foreign investors, and no additional restrictions are allowed. Li said that government at all levels should further streamline administration to reinforce the implementation of existing policies in attracting foreign investment and to reduce institutional costs. The new guideline highlights consistency in policies designed to attract foreign investment. Better protection of intellectual property rights for investors is also covered. The government will work to make it easier for foreign investors and experts to live and work in China. Foreign investment in the \"encouraged categories\" in central and western areas will receive financing, land and taxation incentives. Li has emphasized the importance of foreign investment this year. Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York in September, he vowed that China will carry out a new round of opening-up. Foreign investment is vital for China\\\\\\'s economic transformation and structural adjustment, according to Chen Fengying, a researcher in global economies at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. \"Multinational companies are facing competition from Chinese rival enterprises and rising costs of labor, but the market potential of Chinese consumers and China\\\\\\'s advantage in educated talent still attract overseas investors,\" Chen says. China, which now is encouraging foreign investments to move into high-end, low-carbon and sustainable industries, can improve the business environment and lower market access barriers by introducing negative lists and granting multinational companies national treatment, which may maintain its attractiveness, Chen says. Negative lists include only those activities that are off-limits in a sector, and all other activities are considered open.

When speaking about the future of Netflix, Hastings said that, while movies and TV shows may be all the rage now, he anticipates they\\\\\\'ll eventually become obsolete and will be rivaled by pharmaceutical substitutes, \"like a pill that entertains you.\" This according to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal.

The study, which appeared in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, analyzed the odd beams of light from 234 stars â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a fraction of the 2.5 million that were observed. The bizarre beacons led the paperâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s authors, Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, to conclude that itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9cprobablyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d aliens. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d wrote Borra and Trottier. They also note that their findings align with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars. The hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than, say, radio waves to reveal its existence. Click link for article... **MODS - If this is a duplicate please delete / and or lock ** So apparently signals detected from 230+ stars are fitting the hypothesized parameters established for extraterrestrial intelligence. The stars in question also fit the hypothesized parameters for supporting life. Since only a small amount of stars in the area being looked at are fitting the parameters they are using that as further evidence in support of their claims.

Russia with its declining economy is nothing like the Soviet Union, which aspired to establish a different world order to that pursued by the capitalist West. Russia is in many ways a weak country.

Tornadoes were reported in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Donaldsonville, Ponchatoula and Killian, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. Tornado watches were in effect for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The tornado watch in Louisiana and Mississippi expired after 2 p.m., when the storms moved east, Griffin said. The tornado watch in Alabama and Florida is set to expire at 6 p.m. Severe storms are expected in cities such as Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile and Pensacola. There could still be isolated and severe storms in North and South Carolina. As of Tuesday morning, at least 23 U.S. states were under winter weather alerts, and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the Southeast as most of the country braces for severe weather this week. \"We are in a very active weather pattern all across the country, from California to New York,\"?ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. An atmospheric river, which draws massive amounts of water vapor from the Pacific Ocean, has taken aim at California, where the National Weather Service has issued flash flood and flood watches through Friday.   Copious rainfall is in the forecast for the West Coast until the end of the week, potentially bringing floods, mudslides and debris flows. ABC News\"?weather team predicts more than a half a foot of rain in Central to Northern California over the next several days. Additional rain is expected for Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. \"California will see waves of moisture on and off through Friday,\"?Golembo said.   Meanwhile, thunderstorms and damaging winds are expected to rattle Southern states, from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. The National Weather System has issued a tornado watch for portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and other parts of the region\\\\\\'s coast until 2 p.m. local time. \"severe storms are firing up already in Louisiana and Mississippi,\"?Golembo said. \"damaging winds are the biggest threat this morning.\"?  Northeastern states can expect to see rain, snow and ice this week, according to ABC News meteorologists. The first of two storms arrives today, bringing rain and ice for much of the region, with potential snowfall in Boston and other parts of New England. The icy weather moved through the Hudson Valley into southern New England this morning. By this afternoon, the snow and ice in Boston will transition to heavy rain, with some snow and ice lingering in New England and the upper Hudson Valley near Albany, New York.   ABC News meteorologists said a second storm will move into the Northeast on Thursday morning, bringing mostly snow to New York City and Boston. Heavy snowfall is in the forecast until Thursday afternoon. Some weather models are showing snow farther south in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. \"This could be a plowed event for major Northeast cities,\"?Golembo said. \"stay tuned. This is a changing forecast.\"? \\'\\n \\'\"Whataboutism\" was a favorite Kremlin propaganda technique during the Cold War. It aimed to portray the West as so morally flawed that its criticism of the Soviet empire was hypocritical. Any criticism of the Soviet Union (the war in Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, persecution of dissidents) was met with a list of Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships, trampling trade unions, racial oppression). It was well encapsulated in a joke about the fictional Radio Yerevan (a staple of Soviet-era humor) in which a caller asks what is the average wage of an American manual worker. The real answer would undermine Soviet claims to economic superiority, so after a pause, the pundit replies: \"Over there they lynch Negroes.\" By the time the system collapsed, that phrase had become a derisive synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole. \"Whataboutism\" seemed to have died in the 1990s when Russia\\\\\\'s official aim was to become like the West. But it made a comeback under President Vladimir Putin, whose propaganda machine specializes in spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) in the West. If Americans, Britons, Germans and others can be made to believe that their rulers are crooks and idiots, and that legality and liberty are a sham, then they will be much less likely to take risks and make sacrifices in defending their own countries. To some extent, \"whataboutism\" is a sensible tactic in argument. Criticism delivered from a purported moral high ground deserves special scrutiny. We shouldn\\\\\\'t take lessons from Russia about minority rights, say, given the way that the Kremlin mistreats its own indigenous populations -- Maris, Buryats, Komis and the like. But unlike Putin\\\\\\'s Russia, the West is genuinely well placed to make such criticisms. We are not perfect. But we are self-critical and self-correcting. The cornerstone of our system is contestability. Of course, our elected representatives and government officials make mistakes -- but they are constrained and challenged for them. They risk civil and criminal legal actions, impeachment, media scrutiny, public protest and being tossed out of office into a lifetime of disgrace. These checks and balances are imperfect too, but they do work. President FranÃ§ois Hollande has misruled France only mildly by Russian standards. But whereas he won\\\\\\'t get a second term, President Putin can stay in office as long as he wants. President Trump has made an outrageous mistake in his visa ban and has immediately run into legal obstacles. When was the last time a Russian court told Putin that his actions were illegal? All this is lost on Trump. He appears to wish that America were more like Russia. He finds legal constraints on executive power outrageous. That view is not just mistaken: it is dangerous. All over the world, people look to America as a beacon of freedom and justice. It sets a standard (albeit sometimes a theoretical one) by which other political systems are judged. That represents a huge store of political capital. Trump is squandering it with every word he utters. Moral relativism corrodes sentiment in the frontline states of the new cold war. In places like Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, pro-Western figures are feeling that their struggle is doomed. Why bother fighting for freedom when the leader of the free world has given up? Worse than this, the thinking will spread that maybe Putin is right: the world is all about power and money, and the political currency that really works is coined from lies and fear. If those are the real rules of the game, then better to play them. It seems to have worked for Trump, after all.

Yet itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s also true that for Americans who donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t get insurance through work, and who make too much money to qualify for federal subsidies, the cost of health coverage is about to soar dramatically, with premiums sometimes rising $1,000, even over $2,000 for the year. If one were making 45k per year and the cost of a service increased 1k-2k for THAT year one would find other service providers or not use the service at all.

But in the theatrical, reality-television era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too. And in this case, \"SNL\" writers didn\\\\\\'t just mimic Spicer, they encapsulated a far bigger story: this is what it looks like when a normal, professional political operative becomes Trumpified. And if you didn\\\\\\'t laugh out loud, you may have Trump\\\\\\'s thin-skin disorder. But will Spicer follow his boss\\\\\\'s lead, tweeting out how unfunny \"SNL\" is, or telling reporters that the show is biased and unwatchable? Not if he\\\\\\'s smart, he won\\\\\\'t.  If an \"SNL\" spoof is funny, there\\\\\\'s only one way for the spoofee to handle it -- embrace it. At his next press briefing (Monday\\\\\\'s was called off), where he will undoubtedly be asked about it, he should laugh it off, say he was flattered, and then make a joke at his own expense. He already took a crack at this approach in an interview with Extra on Sunday, telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy \"could dial back\" a bit, but also managing to call the show \"funny.\"  If he can keep this up, he\\\\\\'d be following a long tradition of politicos taking parody in stride.  In 1995, House Republicans invited Chris Farley, who\\\\\\'d been impersonating Speaker Newt Gingrich on \"SNL,\" to impersonate him to his face at the conference meeting while Gingrich laughed along.  After spoofing George H.W. Bush for four years, Dana Carvey was invited to the White House to meet him. After Bush lost to Bill Clinton, he had Carvey come cheer up his staff.  In October of 2008, after Tina Fey spent weeks perfectly portraying then Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Palin appeared on \"SNL\" alongside Fey and Alec Baldwin, who \"mistakes\" her for Fey -- his former 30 Rock co-star -- and asks how she could appear on the show with the real Palin, \"that horrible woman.\"  But that was all BT -- Before Trump. I know dozens of people in his new administration and many have become more like him, at least outwardly. They\\\\\\'ve become defensive, self-serious and aggressive, and they\\\\\\'ve adopted Trump\\\\\\'s rhetorical penchant for hyperbole, bombast and fact-blurring. They say things publicly that I know they never would have said before. It seems like they\\\\\\'re playing a part in a new Trump reality show. I wouldn\\\\\\'t be surprised if Spicer reverts to Trump\\\\\\'s lack of humor toward unflattering satire, just to stick to script. But that would make it infinitely worse. It\\\\\\'s already problematic that the credibility of the White House and its staff is being lampooned only two weeks into the job. With the elevation of Trump political adviser Steve Bannon, some are wondering who are the cooler heads and saner voices surrounding the president. If the White House wants to allay these fears -- and perhaps they do not -- Spicer should be his cooler, saner, pre-Trump self, and play along with McCarthy\\\\\\'s performance. Otherwise, the notion that Trump\\\\\\'s White House can\\\\\\'t take a joke gets a lot more serious.\\'\\n \\'on October 25, 2016 10:41 pm Â· \\\\nNew video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. \\\\nAs part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. \\\\nIn the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t rent to the n-word,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. \\\\nThe revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s run-in with the federal government over discrimination. \\\\nUndercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. \\\\nOne bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d on the documents for â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccolored,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and that was a sign that they should be denied. \\\\nThe Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. \\\\nDonald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s involvement with his fatherâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his fatherâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organizationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away â\\\\x80\\\\x93 itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s still there. \\\\nFeatured image via screen capture Share this Article!

But you can do something about it. On MARCH 14, 2017, we want YOU and your school to join us for #MyFreedomDay. We\\'re asking students to organize events at their school on the day to highlight modern slavery and celebrate freedom. The schools that show the most spirit in fighting slavery will be featured on CNN TV, CNN.com and CNN Facebook. A few schools will even receive a visit from a CNN correspondent, who will report live from the school on the day. So how do you take part? We\\'re encouraging students and teachers to come up with their own ideas, but here are some suggestions for the kind of thing you could do.  Film Screening - Look for movies or documentaries that deal with human trafficking. If you want to use a CNN documentary, we\\'ll let you show it for free. You can watch the videos at cnn.com/myfreedom.  Art Show -- Create art work, in any media, and show it off at the school then post it to Twitter or Instagram using #MyFreedomDay. The theme can be anti-slavery and should include peaceful, hopeful messages; art work about survivors and traffickers, and any form of expression that highlights human trafficking in a way that will raise awareness to your community.  Stand for Freedom -- Students can stand for 45 mins (or 45 hours, if you\\'re really dedicated!) to represent the 45 million victims of slavery in the world today.  Holi Day - The Indian Festival in March celebrates love and color to raise awareness and money. Festivities involve washable pigmented powders that can be thrown at each other. Add music and a booth for human trafficking information and you have a full day of fun for the community.  Panel Discussion -- Invite local lawmakers and anti-trafficking organizations to discuss the issue and what it looks like not just abroad, but in your hometown.  Day of Service -- Support a half-day of service where students volunteer at rehabilitation centers, visit their local lawmakers for a call to action, or collect items needed for survivors in conjunction with local organizations.  It doesn\\'t matter what you do, as long as you do something. Let us know your plans by telling us on Twitter or Instagram, using #MyFreedomDay. (You must be aged 13 or older to post on social media).  Find out more at cnn.com/myfreedom. And you can use the same hashtag to tell us what freedom means to you. - It could be the freedom to see your friends or family - Freedom to be yourself - Freedom to do the job you choose - Freedom to travel - Freedom to express yourself the way you choose  Whatever freedom means in your life -- the important thing is the message, and encouraging people to think about the freedom they may take for granted.\"\\n \\'By Bernie Suarez Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s always important to keep a strong perspective on reality and the objective truth about what is happening even though we ourselves... \\'\\n \\'\"A lot of roads, lots of bus rides, and a lot of walking too,\" she tells CNN, agreeing to be interviewed but asking that we only use her first name and not show her face. \"For a 7-month pregnant woman, that is a long, long time.\" Yolanda says she is originally from Congo. She and her husband are among tens of thousands of migrants -- many from Africa and Haiti -- criss-crossing South and Central America trying to reach the United States. Now they\\\\\\'re stuck in the border town of Paso Canoas, Costa Rica, waiting for the travel documents that will let them enter the country and continue their journey northward.  \"I hope to leave soon, for my turn to come fast so I can see a doctor,\" she says. \"I don\\\\\\'t want my baby to be born on the road.\" Read: Deadly crossing into Europe Long an obligatory stop on an important trade and tourist route, Paso Canoas has seen an unprecedented influx of migrants trekking north in recent months.  The huge surge in undocumented arrivals is a logistical and humanitarian nightmare for the government of Costa Rica.  \"At this moment Costa Rica is absolutely overwhelmed with our immigration situation and we\\\\\\'re doing our best to protect the human rights of the people who are coming,\" said Mauricio Herrera Ulloa, the Costa Rican Communications Minister and point person for the migration crisis.  \"No one was prepared or was thinking about the possibility that we would receive 10,000 people from Haiti or Africa.\" Perilous journeys Since April, when Costa Rica first started issuing transit visas for undocumented migrants, more than 18,000 people have crossed the border into the country. There are no comparative figures because the demand simply wasn\\\\\\'t there in previous years so the visas didn\\\\\\'t exist, officials say.  It is a situation that is being replicated in border towns throughout the Americas.  Experts say migrants are risking their lives in perilous journeys that expose them to crime and hunger and leave them vulnerable to human trafficking. \"They offer (migrants) something that they really need and in the case of these people, what they really need is to get one more border north,\" says Cy Winter, director of border management for the International Organization for Migration (IOM). More on human trafficking That means they often pay so-called coyotes for illegal border crossings -- breaking their ties to the state and public administration system. They often fall prey to false job offers \"just over the border.\"  \"But then, on the other side, what\\\\\\'s arranged there is completely different,\" says Winter. \"So they end up in a place where they have to work and they\\\\\\'ve got no way to get away from it.\" \\\\\\'Congo isn\\\\\\'t a country, it\\\\\\'s a password\\\\\\'  The IOM and other experts believe the majority of migrants are Haitians, many of them pretending to be Congolese in order to avoid deportation since it would be too costly for most Latin American countries to fly them to Africa. And in both Haiti and Congo, French is spoken.  \"The people I\\\\\\'ve spoken to claiming to be from Congo, barely know the capital and don\\\\\\'t know the dialects that are spoken in the Congo and don\\\\\\'t know the football jersey,\" said Winter.  According to the US Secretary of Homeland Security, some 40,000 Haitian migrants are working their way north, already overwhelming many border crossings into the United States.  Many of them entered Brazil as legal refugees after the 2010 earthquake. But the economic crisis in Brazil has made it increasingly difficult for migrants to get jobs, sparking an exodus. \"We\\\\\\'ve seen accumulations of up to 5,000 people on the border in various countries in South America so it is a concerning uptick in arrivals,\" said Winter.  One migrant I met on the Panamanian-Costa Rican border told me that every single one of the dozens of \"Congolese\" migrants milling about the migration office was actually from Haiti.  \"Here, Congo isn\\\\\\'t a country, it\\\\\\'s a password,\" he said, explaining that he and others destroy their passports so that they can re-invent themselves.  The bottlenecks at borders have raised serious concerns. The IOM has begun offering workshops at schools like Colegio Progreso -- in Panama, just across the border from Paso Canoas -- teaching students about the connection between migration and human trafficking.  In the past, the school was used as a shelter for hundreds of Cubans trying to make their way to the United States. The regional school director says she heard stories of women turning to prostitution in desperation.  \"In relation to the people being trafficked, we\\\\\\'ve heard horror stories,\" said Flor Bonilla.  In San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, Marilia Morales is just as worried. She founded the non-profit Rahab Foundation 20 years ago to rescue, rehabilitate and support survivors of sexual exploitation. Now she\\\\\\'s launching a project on Costa Rica\\\\\\'s northern border with Nicaragua.  \"We have an avalanche of people coming, we have Africans, Haitians, we have people coming from a lot of places,\" Morales told CNN.  \"We are in the process of training our personnel and we are going to be working with this community directly because they have to be aware that they could be victims of human trafficking, either for slave labor, sexual slavery and other ends,\" she said.  Nicaragua has closed its borders to undocumented migrants forcing thousands on the border into deplorable makeshift shelters and tent villages.  On Costa Rica\\\\\\'s southern border, officials are trying to process migrants as quickly as possible. They\\\\\\'re admitting 100-200 a day, but there is a long waiting list. In Yolanda\\\\\\'s case, her hopes for a quick trip through Costa Rica were quickly dashed. Upon arrival, she was told she would have to wait six weeks just for an appointment with immigration officials.  Without the laissez-passer, she and her husband can\\\\\\'t access the shelters set up by authorities in conjunction with the Red Cross -- warehouses and schools where migrants get free meals and a mattress to sleep on.  For the time being, they are sleeping in a makeshift hostel just a short walk from the border. They pay $5 a day and squeeze in with some 50 other people.  Yolanda says she left Congo for Brazil, where she worked in a restaurant for a year. She says both she and her husband lost their jobs in the recession -- just as they discovered she was pregnant. Now, their dream is for their daughter to be born in the United States.  But the odds are not in their favor. The money they borrowed from family back home is running out and she says they can\\\\\\'t ask for more.  While Yolanda says she is from Congo, when I first met her, she couldn\\\\\\'t at first remember or pronounce what she said was her hometown: Brazzaville, the capital of Congo.  When the time came to say goodbye to Yolanda and her husband, I couldn\\\\\\'t help but wonder where they came from, and where this journey will ultimately take them.  Unfortunately for Haitians trying to make their way into the United States, officials recently eliminated the generous benefits and easy entry that were established after the 2010 earthquake.  Which means that even if they make it to the US border after months of travel and hardship, neither Haitian nor Congolese migrants are likely to get in. \\'\\n \\'He has quite a history , he sold the derivatives in Australia and is another homosexual as are most of the media and those in power , the woman who works with him in charge of police and law was ran the MK ULTRA ,ufrtd in Chelmsford hospitals . tHERE IS A GREAT BOOK ABOUT IT ALL FROM UNDERCOVER called sex collectors by Greg Hallet , they chased him out of NZ tried to kill him lots of times .

But, like I, I would say I let them do that to me. I am dirty. It\\\\\\'s my fault,\" says Chopek through tears. But Chopek is finally speaking out, determined to shake the guilt and shame that she knows should stalk her perpetrators instead of her. \"Now I see that I was just a child,\" says Chopek, now sitting serenely in a safe house, a healing lodge in rural Manitoba that cradled her in the love and protection she so needed when she escaped her life on the streets. Now 19, Lauren was just 14 when she was sexually exploited and trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg. But as an indigenous girl in Canada, her story is hardly rare. More from the CNN Freedom Project Canada\\\\\\'s indigenous population is very small -- just 4% of the population -- yet more than 50% of all sex trafficking victims in Canada are indigenous. The reasons are complicated and varied but are ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty, racism and abuse. \"I was actually making these bad choices for a reason,\" explains Chopek. \"You know when you experience sexual abuse it\\\\\\'s really confusing. You never know if it\\\\\\'s your fault or is it theirs.\" \\\\\\'Targets of violence and abuse\\\\\\' Diane Redsky runs Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre, which advocates for indigenous women and children, specifically sex trafficking victims. Her organization runs the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed, as well as safe houses, rehabilitation and prevention programs throughout Manitoba. Read: Trafficked women tattooed by their pimps Redsky says the history of racism against indigenous Canadians feeds into the cycle of violence and exploitation against them. \"It\\\\\\'s really difficult to be able to fight those stereotypes as indigenous women when a whole society is targeting indigenous women and girls, particularly for violence and abuse -- and that spills over into sex trafficking,\" says Redsky. Tanay Little\\\\\\'s story shows how insidious the abuse can be. Little was just 11 when she was sexually exploited on the streets surrounding her family\\\\\\'s home in Winnipeg. An older girl, someone who pretended to be her friend she says, was actually preying on Little, first luring her with drugs and then trafficking her for sex. \"I remember one time that she put me in a room and then two guys, one, not together, but one would come in and then I would have sex with him and then the other the other guy would come in. And then I\\\\\\'d get high after that,\" says Little. She is blunt about what would happen if she refused to have sex with anybody. \"If you\\\\\\'re not beat up, then you would get raped by a few of them at once,\" explains Little. \"There is a debt bondage that\\\\\\'s between $1,000 and $2,000 a day that these girls must bring, must hand in to their trafficker or else,\" says Redsky. These startling anecdotes have been heard in family homes, police stations and safe houses for years in Manitoba. The province is now taking the lead on an innovative approach to prevention and rehabilitation. Focus on the victims Redsky and others in Manitoba are now leading transformative programs to help identify the threats and risks so prevalent in indigenous communities. It is a new approach to help fight sex trafficking, one that focuses on the needs of the victims. Jennifer Richardson runs Tracia\\\\\\'s Trust, Manitoba\\\\\\'s strategy to combat sexual exploitation and sex trafficking of children. Crucially, Manitoba\\\\\\'s government has committed more than $10 million Canadian a year to fund it, a huge sum for a population of only about a million people. \"Within a 10-year span Manitoba has really grown this massive strategy that is just recognized throughout Canada as being kind of the frontier leaders in this area,\" says Richardson. Read: \\\\\\'I was raped 43,200 times\\\\\\' The program is different and revolutionary for Manitoba because it uses not only targeted funds, but also words, deeds, and training to fight human trafficking in a whole new way. Outreach on neighborhood streets is one strategy that is executed with the help of law enforcement officers. Almost daily, Winnipeg Police dispatch an elite unit on the streets to try and counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking. The approach is a departure for Winnipeg Police, who now say their efforts are firmly focused on helping victims. Outreach is conducted in a way to help victims and then bring their perpetrators to justice. Law enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism that in the past prevented police from truly understanding how and why indigenous girls are vulnerable and at risk. \"There is bias in the police service. We recognize it, that there\\\\\\'s implicit bias. We certainly have taken steps to try to address that in a myriad of ways,\" says Danny Smyth, Winnipeg\\\\\\'s deputy police chief. \"We have a team that\\\\\\'s dedicated just to outreach. Just to being out there and trying to get to know who\\\\\\'s out on the street, and trying to establish a relationship with them,\" adds Smyth. The legacy of years of abuse and racism though are making it difficult for Canada\\\\\\'s indigenous community to heal and move on. Canada will soon launch an inquiry that will focus on why hundreds of indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been murdered over the years. Canadian and independent studies have revealed that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than non-indigenous women and girls. \"We\\\\\\'re still in a society that targets indigenous women and girls. In fact the national task force concluded that there\\\\\\'s a market for indigenous girls,\" says Redsky, adding, \"what that leads to is a society who views indigenous women as less than, and in fact of no human value.\"\\'\\n \\'By James Holbrooks As Iraqi military forces were beginning their initial push into Mosul on Tuesday, the Washington Post was reporting that U.S. defense officials... \\'\\n \\'In the background of the photo, which was posted online, are products including prescription medication. But zooming in on that pill bottle makes the details unreadable. In a small, dark lab Jim Cole, special agent and supervisor of Victim Identification at the Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center gets to work using the latest technology available. Using technology to identify abusers \"Utilizing some technology that hadn\\\\\\'t even been released to the public yet we were able to take a look at the bottle and reverse out some of the motion blur,\" Cole said. They can now see the offender\\\\\\'s first name \"Stephen,\" the first two letters of the last name and the first three digits on the prescription order. With that he applies to the pharmacy for the customer details of every person who fits that criteria. It narrows the list down to a man named \"Stephen Keating.\" But that\\\\\\'s not all. The offender\\\\\\'s fingers are also in the picture and incredibly this crack team manages to pull the fingerprints from the image. \"That was the first time we were able to do that,\" Cole said. The evidence was strong enough to put Stephen Keating behind bars for 110 years. Investigators rescued his 14 victims. No victim left behind Cole co-founded Project VIC: their aim is that no victim is be left behind. \"We strive to find these children as quick as possible,\" Cole said. \"The longer it takes us the longer that child is in harm\\\\\\'s way.\" Read: Raid reunites trafficked sisters It\\\\\\'s not an easy task when Cole says they are seeing 500,000 images a week: that\\\\\\'s over 25 million a year. The Keating case ran for about three weeks and in the past it could have taken months -- or worse, the image may never have been uncovered at all. Using technology known as \"Photo DNA\" their computers can wade through the hundreds of thousands of photos fast, categorizing the ones they\\\\\\'ve already seen to allow his team to focus on the new victims. \"What used to take us nine months now takes us a month,\" said Cole. \"It helps us review video on a scale of about 100 times faster than previously,\" he added. \"It\\\\\\'s been a complete game-changer for law enforcement and we get that feedback from the field all the time.\" Easing psychological burden The efficiency not only saves time, it helps ease the psychological burden on investigators. \"We definitely see a mental health benefit because the nature of our offenders is they are trading material we\\\\\\'ve seen hundreds of thousands of times in addition to the new material,\" Cole said. Read: Vietnamese girls smuggled in to China, sold as brides The technology helped investigators find a seemingly harmless photo of a known offender with her victim on vacation. The image showed the pair holding fish at a campsite. The fish were isolated from the image and sent to Cornell University, which provided investigators with a geographical area where those fish can be caught. The campsite image, with the child and perpetrator removed, was sent to every single campsite advertiser in that location. Upon tracking down the actual campsite they found the same photo posted in the reception room. \"Within four hours we had her identified,\" Cole said. The child was rescued and the woman is now serving a 25-year sentence. On another image of an offender with a young girl, the Project VIC team noticed a company logo on the man\\\\\\'s sweatshirt but they couldn\\\\\\'t decipher what was written. Some cutting edge technology helped make the logo almost completely readable. An online search for names that might match the letters led investigators to a plumbing business. The offender, a former employee, was tracked down and four victims were rescued. Global problem The number of images like these being shared online is on the rise. Last year the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received 4.4 million reports to its CyberTipline. That\\\\\\'s a nearly 800% increase in reporting since 2013. Tip-offs come from the public, and also companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, who are mandated by U.S. regulations to report any such images. According to Lindsay Olson, director of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC, 94% of the cases last year were outside the United States. \"The CyberTipline receives reports of child porn, online enticement of children for sexual acts, online sex trafficking, child molestation; any type of child exploitation can be reported to the cyber tip line,\" said Olson. \"We make reports available to law enforcement in about 100 countries and we also work with Europol and Interpol.\" Swedish based company Griffeye was one of the founding partners of Project VIC. Director Johann Hofmann says it donates its software to be used in child exploitation cases. \"As more and more crime is becoming more and more digital as data is being distributed online,\" he said. \"You see a new type of police officer that is behind a computer screen and with the right tools they can crack these cases.\" The Internet has no borders so law enforcement agencies need to overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together. Project VIC is now being used by Interpol, Europol and agencies in 35 countries including the United Kingdom and Canada, and it\\\\\\'s about to be rolled out in Australia. In the United States the results speak for themselves. \"We\\\\\\'ve been absolutely floored by the success we\\\\\\'ve seen with Project VIC,\" said Cole. \"Going back a few years we were seeing victims in the low hundreds and in this past year we\\\\\\'ve rescued over 1,000 victims just in HSI (Homeland Security Investigations -- a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)). alone and we\\\\\\'ve seen similar results in other agencies as well.\"\\'\\n \\'Lan remembers the night that changed her whole life. While preparing for university along the border in northern Vietnam, a friend she met online asked her to a group dinner. When she was tired and wanted to go home, the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink. Next thing she knew, she had been smuggled across the border to China. \"At that time, I wanted to leave,\" says Lan. \"There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us.\" The villages along the Vietnamese-Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers. Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged, then spirited across the porous border by boat, motorbike or car. Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China, where the one-child policy and long-standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio. To put it simply, Chinese men are hungry for brides. \"It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman,\" explained Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.\\\\\\'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam. Traditionally, Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding. \"This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries, including Vietnam.\" Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam. She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3,000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese. Nguyen was just 16 when a friend\\\\\\'s boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China. She tried to resist a forced marriage. For three months, she refused, even though her traffickers beat her, withheld food and threatened to kill her, she says. Finally, she relented. She says her husband was kind to her, but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam. \"My desire to go home was indescribable,\" Nguyen said. \"I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him.\" When her mother-in-law realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage, the family returned her to the traffickers. They got their money back, Nguyen says, after which she was forced into a second marriage. A refuge for escaped women The Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai, northern Vietnam. The young women stay for an average of two to three years. They go to school or get vocational training. They do art therapy. They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden. Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences, the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves. \"Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives,\" says Diep. Her organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers. About once a month, a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha, a regional hub for buying food, fabric and livestock. On this day, on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers, they talk about their experiences, take questions and play games with the crowd. When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking, more than 20 people come forward. \"I think awareness is the only tool,\" Diep says. Ha from the U.N. agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness, especially in the poor, rural regions along the border. She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work, another common way traffickers lure victims. Saved at the border During CNN\\\\\\'s trip to the border, the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker. We met the girls, who are just 14 years old. They said they were promised $600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village. They didn\\\\\\'t tell their parents they were going. The neighbor is now under arrest. The Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China, by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities. Nguyen Tuong Long, the head of the government\\\\\\'s social vice prevention department in Lao Cai, says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims. \"Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police, we have found and caught trafficking rings,\" Nguyen says. \"We\\\\\\'ve found women far inside China, at brothels where they\\\\\\'re forced to become sex workers.\" Trafficked women who aren\\\\\\'t rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own. Some of them say they were able to contact their families from China, but they couldn\\\\\\'t get help from police because they didn\\\\\\'t know exactly where they were. Lan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China. After two years, together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station. The whole time they were afraid their husbands\\\\\\' families would find them. The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam. The women were free of their forced marriages, but they paid a high price. Both left their babies in China.

Do you think that the JASTA law will succeed or will it be countered by the Zionist allies of Saudi Arabia? Do the fact that the USA and the Westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the Saudis to Yemen isn\\\\\\'t due to the weight of the lobby Zionist?\\\\nThe Zionist-Wahhabi/Saudi alliance goes back to Ibn Saud who wrote the British and Zionist leaders that he did not oppose a Jewish homeland in Palestine so long as it did not lay claim to Saudi territory on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba.

He hosted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a proponent of the autism theory, in January at Trump Tower in New York City. Kennedy said afterward that Trump had asked him to head a commission investigating vaccine safety.- A Trump spokeswoman previously said no decision had been made about whether to create a commission. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.-- Public health groups have been wary of wading into the political fray on vaccines, reluctant to give the impression that there\\\\\\'s any legitimate debate among scientists over whether people should have their children immunized. The letter had been in the works since Trump\\\\\\'s vaccine doubts resurfaced last month, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Several government bodies already vouch for the safety of vaccines, and nongovernment researchers have repeatedly probed the link between vaccines and autism since a 1998 paper first caused alarm. That paper has since been retracted.\\'\\n \"Well finally we have the big global Business/Bank Goldman Sachs officially endorsing Hillary Clinton for President !!

Researchers found that people who switched from smoking regular cigarettes to e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) such as gum or patches for at least six months had much lower levels of toxins in their saliva and urine than those who continued to smoke. \"ourstudy adds to existing evidence showing that e-cigarettes and NRT are far safer than smoking, and suggests that there is a very low risk associated with their long-term use,\"?said Lion Shahab, a specialist in epidemiology and public health at University College London who led the work. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor, have grown into an $8 billion-a-year market, according to Euromonitor International - more than three times that of NRT products. They are, however, still dwarfed by a tobacco market estimated by Euromonitor to be worth around $700 billion. Many health experts think e-cigarettes, or vapes, which do not contain tobacco, are a lower-risk alternative to smoking and potentially a major public health tool. But some question their long-term safety and worry that they may act as a \"gateway\"?to taking up conventional cigarettes. The U.S. surgeon general in December urged lawmakers to impose price and tax policies that would discourage their use. Monday\\\\\\'s study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed saliva and urine samples from long-term e-cigarette and NRT users as well as smokers, and compared levels of key chemicals found in their bodies. It found that smokers who switched completely to e-cigarettes or NRT had significantly lower levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogens compared to people who continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes. Those who used e-cigarettes or NRT but did not completely quit smoking did not show the same drop in toxin levels. This underlined that a complete switch was needed to get the long-term health benefits of quitting tobacco, the researchers said. The World Health Organization says tobacco is the world\\\\\\'s biggest preventable killer, with a predicted cumulative death toll of a billion by the end of this century if current trends continue. Tobacco smoking currently kills around 6 million people a year. Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at the government authority Public Health England, said the findings held a clear message for tobacco smokers. \"Switching to e-cigarettes can significantly reduce harm to smokers, with greatly reduced exposure to carcinogens and toxins,\"?he said in a statement. \"the findings also make clear that the benefit is only realized if people stop smoking completely and make a total switch. \"the best thing a smoker can do, for themselves and those around them, is to quit now, completely and forever.\"?(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\\'\\n \\'John McNaughton is a special American painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current governmentâ\\\\x80¦troubled and corrupt.

Its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information. Now we have a new twist: information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it. In other words, the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a user/consumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the eventâ\\\\x80¦â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cInformation can be dressed up a thousand different ways. But it tends to have an â\\\\x80\\\\x98elasticâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 quality. By that I mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up. Thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press. They expose themselves, even though they donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to. It takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation. This is happening now, right in front of our eyes.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe basis of big media is theater. News is theater. Its directors and producers think theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing a first-rate job. But theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re sadly mistaken. Gaps and obfuscations are growing larger. The outright non-sequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent. The audience is wising up to the farce. Who are these fools who direct the news? Theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer. But that transaction doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t contain any guarantees about shelf life.

Rosie Ayliffe says the possibility of terrorism was discounted early in the investigation. \"My daughter\\\\\\'s death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,\" she wrote. Police in Australia allege that suspect Smail Ayad shouted \"Allahu akbar\" \"?an Arabic phrase meaning \"God is great\" \"?during the attack, but said there was no indication the assault was motivated by extremism. They have said they are investigating whether Ayad, who is French and was 29 years old at the time of killing, had a romantic obsession with Ayliffe-Chung. The attack took place in front of dozens of backpackers at a hostel in northern Queensland. Ayliffe-Chung was found dead at the scene. Jackson tried to stop the attack and was fatally wounded. \"This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred,\" Ayliffe wrote.\\'\\n \\'By Ivan Oransky, New York University and Adam Marcus, Johns Hopkins University Have you heard that scientists are planning a march on Washington? The move is not being billed as a protest, but rather as a \"celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community,\" although it comes as a direct response to recent policy changes and statements by the Trump administration. Not everyone thinks the nonprotest protest is a good thing. It\\\\\\'s \"a terrible idea,\" wrote Robert Young, a geologist at Western Carolina University, in The New York Times. The march, Young said, will just reinforce a belief among some conservatives that \"scientists are an interest group,\" and polarize the issue, making researchers\\\\\\' jobs more difficult. Others find that argument less than convincing, pointing out that science and politics have always been intertwined. As the founders of the blog Retraction Watch and the Center for Scientific Integrity, we often see researchers reluctant to push for or embrace change - whether it\\\\\\'s to the conventional way of dealing with misconduct in journals (which for years was basically to not do so) or addressing problems of reproducibility of their experiments. To the timorous, airing dirty laundry, and letting the public in on the reality of science, could endanger public trust - and funding. So this isn\\\\\\'t the first time scientists and engineers have voiced similar concerns. Take the example of Marc Edwards and his colleagues at Virginia Tech: To many people watching the Flint water crisis, they were heroes. After being asked to visit by concerned residents, they found, and announced, that people in the beleaguered city were being exposed to excessive amounts of lead through their tap water. They also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for water filters for city residents and created a website to push their findings about the hazards of the city\\\\\\'s water supply and shame governments at all levels to act. If not for their tireless efforts, thousands of children may have been exposed to dangerous amounts of lead for far longer than they already were. Even the Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged that it waited too long to sound the alarm.   But that\\\\\\'s not exactly how the editor of a leading engineering journal sees things. In October, a remarkable editorial appeared in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The essay, by University of California, Berkeley engineering professor and Water Center Director David Sedlak, ES&T\\\\\\'s editor-in-chief, expressed concern that some of his colleagues in the field had crossed the \"imaginary line\" between scientist and advocate. \"Speaking out against a corrupt or incompetent system may be the product of a culture where idealism, personal responsibility, and Hollywood\\\\\\'s dramatic sensibilities conspire to create a narrative about the noble individual fighting injustice,\" Sedlak wrote. By becoming \"allies of a particular cause, no matter how just, we jeopardize the social contract that underpins the tradition of financial support for basic research.\" In other words, don\\\\\\'t cross Congress - which many scientists already view as hostile to their profession - and risk retaliation in the form of budget cuts. That\\\\\\'s no small pie, either. Through its oversight of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Energy and other agencies and programs, Congress holds the strings to a research purse worth nearly US$70 billion a year.  Let\\\\\\'s take a moment to absorb all that. Some (unnamed but easily identified) scientists, lulled by the media, have cast themselves as superheroes in a struggle against villains born of their own conceit. Their arrogance and vanity threaten to awaken the master, who will punish us all for the sins of a few. We rarely get the opportunity to watch a chilling effect in action, but you can almost see the breath of researchers caught up in a debate over the proper role of scientists in the crisis. It\\\\\\'s not just engineers who fear speaking out. \"We have too often been reluctant to voice our protest, for fear of incurring the [National Institute of Mental Health\\\\\\'s] displeasure (and losing whatever opportunities we still have for funding),\" wrote neuroscientist John Markowitz in The New York Times last fall. In a refreshing piece, Markowitz was arguing that \"there\\\\\\'s such a thing as too much neuroscience.\" As cofounders of Retraction Watch, a blog that focuses on some of science\\\\\\'s nasty episodes, we are occasionally admonished that pointing out cases of fraud - even when we also praise good behavior - will give anti-science forces ammunition. In some ways, we should be glad scientists are acknowledging these concerns, instead of pretending they\\\\\\'re never swayed by the almighty dollar. But anyone who clings to the notion that science exists in a pure vacuum, untainted by politics, economics or social justice needs also to understand that science is a human endeavor and scientists have the same eyes and ears for injustice and outrage as the rest of us. Although the conduct of science demands honesty and rigor, nowhere is it written that researchers must remain silent when governments or other powerful players either misuse science or suppress findings in the service of harmful policies. And before Edwards and his efforts on behalf of the Flint community, some scientists have spoken out. Claire Patterson, a physical chemist, put himself on a decades-long collision course with industry when he took on lead poisoning. John Snow earned the ire of Londoners when he removed the pump handle on a cholera-infested well, and wasn\\\\\\'t vindicated until after his death. It took Peter Buxtun several years to stop the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment; he eventually had to leak documents to reporter Jean Heller in 1972. Edwards and his colleagues, we would argue, are part of a long tradition of bridging the worlds of science and policy. They have been instrumental in bringing not only attention but change to the beleaguered city of Flint. And money: Thanks in part to their pressure, the Senate in September voted overwhelmingly to approve $100 million in aid for Flint, and hundreds of millions more in loans from the Environmental Protection Agency for upgrading municipal water infrastructures and studying exposure to lead.   In a stinging rebuke to Sedlak, Edwards and three coauthors - Amy Pruden, Siddhartha Roy and William Rhoads - blasted the critical editorial as a \"devastating, self-indictment of cowardice and perverse incentives in modern academia.\" Indeed, scientists who accept funding with the tacit agreement that they keep their mouths shut about the government are far more threatening to an independent academy than those who speak their minds. Since Nov. 8, it has been painfully clear that science will be playing defense for a while. The United States has never seen a regime so hostile to science and the value of the scientific method. President Donald Trump has declared climate change a \"hoax\" cooked up by the Chinese. He has flirted seriously with debunked anti-vaccination views and declared that polls (read, data) that are negative about his ambitions are \"fake news.\" Science and politics are not always compatible. And science need not always triumph over policy: After all, research shows that steroids improve athletic performance, but we have a compelling political interest to ban them. The same can be said of eugenics. Research must always be ethical, and ethics is a conversation that includes scientists and policymakers. Still, while the two domains are separate, the divide is, and should be, bridgeable. As Edwards and his colleagues write, \"The personal and professional peril is great, the critics are numerous and vocal, but staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice. And no matter what may come of the rest of our lives or careers, we are certain of one thing: Flint was a community worth going out on a limb for, and by upholding a just cause, we enhanced the social contract between academics and the public.\" That could easily be said of the March for Science. Except now it\\\\\\'s not just a limb but the entire tree that\\\\\\'s in peril.

In this article, we identify these risks, and tell you how investing in art through Arthena will make you want to start today. Comparables, Experience and Costs: Needless to say, investment grade art is not the stock market or the real estate market where you can compare prices of one asset to another. With art assets, the ability to determine the legitimacy and the price, comes with expertise - this barrier makes it difficult for the traditional investor to confidently invest. When evaluating a work of art, art appraisers look for: Authenticity, condition, rarity, provenance, and value. Art appraisers\\\\\\' expertise can charge anywhere between $50 dollars to several hundreds of dollars an hour, and not all have equivalent experiences. Additional time is needed to ween out truly experienced art appraisers from those who are not. How can Arthena help? By investing through Arthena, we take away all the troubles of doing your own research, determining which work to purchase, placing the right bid, and hiring the right appraiser. At Arthena, we use our very own regression analysis to determine works of art to purchase for investment purposes. We organize artworks with similar core characteristics into logical groups according to their specific criteria, in accordance with USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) guidelines, which is also known as a IRS appraisal. The characteristics include artist, genre, date range, content, materials, size, coloration, and style, among others. Then, Arthena targets works by artists that have shown appreciation over the past 5 years and are projected to grow by 20% +/- YoY over the next five, or the lifetime of the fund. From storage to insurance, Arthena takes all these burdens away from the traditional art investor. By investing a minimum of $10k into our funds, we handle every troublesome task when it comes to acquiring a work of art. Just sit back, and watch your investment grow. Illiquidity: Generally, the art market is relatively illiquid in comparison to traditional assets such as equities and stocks. Therefore, art assets are ideal for long-term investments. That being said, there is varying liquidity within the art market itself. Determined by the difference between the ask and bid price, the lower the bid price from the ask price, the more illiquid the asset is. The greater the bid is from the ask price, the more liquid it is. Let Arthena identify the art market\\\\\\'s most liquid assets: Arthena acquires works in the emerging, PWC, and Modern market sectors, which in total account for over 70% of the US market, and have shown the highest rate of growth over the past 10 years. Art market analysts have identified the most liquid sector of the art market are works of art under $250,000. Arthena confirms that the artist and art work fit our growth metrics, rate at 1 or above for Sharpe Ratio, to confirm that it is a high growth investment with low volatility, and determine its maximum acquisition price Lack of Data: Many reports have noted upon the lack of transparency in the art market. As a result, companies have created indices such as Mei Moses and Artnet index to amend this \"problem\". Nonetheless, these indices bring in a new set of issues. Such indices as the two mentioned do not encompass the entire art market. For example, Mei Moses\\\\\\'s data lies primarily on numbers from Sotheby\\\\\\'s and Christie\\\\\\'s, negating their online sales as well as other auction houses and private sales. Another problem is that some indexes rely heavily on repeat sales, but does not include bought in lots, which variates some data. How Arthena operates through transparency: As such, Arthena acquires works at auction for increased price transparency to the benefit of our investors and our methodology. When works from Arthena\\\\\\'s index of artists appear at auction, Arthena uses regression modeling to determine maximum acquisition price. Once acquired, investors can view their art collection through Arthena\\\\\\'s online dashboard, allowing our clients to have full access into their investments.  Stock market vs. art market performance: Multiple art market analysts have determined that the art market has a low correlation to the stock market, while other analysts have deemed that there is still a certain level of correlation between the two because of the notion that investors would only spend disposable income on collectibles and luxury assets when the market is bullish rather than vice versa. Regardless, the art market has proven itself to be a great store of wealth especially during times of economic uncertainty. Notably, it only took the art market 16 months to return to pre-recession levels in 2008, while the stock market took six years. As such, according to Deloitte: \"Increasing awareness of art as an asset class: 53% of wealth managers had a high level of awareness of developments linked to art as an asset class, up from 43% in 2012 and 33% in 2011; this signals that increasing attention is being paid by the wealth management community to the art and collectibles market.\" - Deloitte and ArtTactic Art & Finance Report 2014  Arthena takes a new approach to investing in art. Like a hedge fund, Arthena identifies specific market segments and artists that have shown impressive historical performance and creates buy orders to acquire said works.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a longtime champion of paid family leave, on Tuesday reintroduced her Family Act, which would guarantee 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers. The legislation, which proposes a universal paid leave program funded by a small payroll tax, failed to advance in the previous session of the Republican-led Congress, and likely faces the same fate under Trump. But Gillibrand and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), sponsor of a companion bill in the House, on Tuesday expressed optimism that the president would be receptive, in part because Ivanka Trump has spoken about the issue. \"I am hopeful that the administration will reach out to me and work with me on a national paid leave plan,\"?Gillibrand said on a call with reporters. Gillibrand referenced Ivanka Trump\\\\\\'s speech at last summer\\\\\\'s Republican National Convention, in which she presented her father, who has a record of demeaning women, as a champion for women\\\\\\'s rights and a supporter of equal pay for women. It led many progressives to hope that her influence would encourage-\"?or at least make it possible \"?that the president pivot from his campaign promises. Ivanka Trump also tried during the campaign to deflect attention away from her father\\\\\\'s history of misogyny and climate change denial. Last week, Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser, reportedly convinced the president not to roll back LGBTQ protections, a important achievement of former President Barack Obama. Trump\\\\\\'s proposed paid leave plan, like most of his policy proposals, contains little substance and is limited in scope. It allows for six weeks of paid leave, and only applies to mothers. Ivanka Trump said in an interview when her father\\\\\\'s leave plan was announced in September that it is intended to \"help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth.\"?She would not elaborate on whether it would apply to LGBTQ, adoptive or foster parents, or people caring for aging parents. \"we\\\\\\'ll wait to see what the dimensions of it, what the details are,\"?DeLauro said of Trump\\\\\\'s proposal.- \"I don\"t know when they will move forward with making a substantive proposal,\"?she added. \"We\\\\\\'r waiting for them to join the debate. We\\\\\\'r on the field. The U.S. remains the only industrialized country without mandated paid family leave. Sunday was the 24th anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave for people who work at companies with more than 50 employees. The push for universal paid leave is growing, with state legislatures and businesses enacting more expansive plans. Gillibrand said she hopes to gain bipartisan support because the issue affects everyone. \"Despite the fact that we don\"t have a Republican yet, I am optimistic that people will be demanding action on this issue, that people will rise up and say we need a national paid leave plan, and really call on their elected leaders to listen to the challenges that they\\\\\\'r facing,\"?Gillibrand said. \"I am hopeful that the new administration will focus on it because they did run on it, they did talk about it, and it should be nonpartisan.\"?,-1\"\\'\\n \\'By Brandon Turbeville Anti-fluoridation activists in Georgia received a major boost of support when former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Jimmy Carter, Andrew... \\'\\n \"Heartless Trump cuts sweet old granny\\'s water supply page: 1 link A 92-year-old Scottish widow is forced to drink stream water she collects in a wheelbarrow because Donald Trump refuses to fix the damage caused by builders working on his Â£1billion golf course.

Prof. Hall has been the target of a witch hunt mounted by Facebook and by B\\\\\\'nai Brith Canada. The mission of the Canadian branch of the Anti-Defamation League is to provide Zionist advocacy for \"the security of Israel.\"\\\\nIn late August of 2016 a maliciously engineered smear item was placed on Prof. Hall\\\\\\'s FB page without his knowledge or consent. The B\\\\\\'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to \"Kill All Jews.\" The B\\\\\\'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall\\\\\\'s academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982.\\\\nThe University of Lethbridge\\\\\\'s administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel\\\\\\'s genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever.\\\\nThe attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon\\\\\\'s unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom.\\\\nIn his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history.\\\\nWRITER\\\\nProf. Tony Hall Dr. Hall is editor in chief of American Herald Tribune.

In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome of the people were wondering whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on, who is this guy?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview. He understood why. His mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly American faces. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a time of such intrigue and suspicion,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr. Kaine said. Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to â\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching. But the strong social-justice message of liberation theology helped set Mr. Kaine on a left-veering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination, became a liberal mayor, and rose as a Spanish-speaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on Latin America.\\'\\n \\'Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) vehemently defended President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s ban on refugees and travelers Tuesday, arguing that terrorists who come from the Middle East are an existential threat to the United States and totally different from white domestic terrorists,-who just commit \"Ane-off\"?incidents that the government can\"t do anything about.- Duffy said Trump was justified in stopping Syrian refugees from entering the United States \"until in Syria they figure out this conflict in the civil war and this hotbed for terrorism.\"?Presumably, however, once the conflict is over, women and children, for example, won\"t feel it is as necessary to escape their country to find a safe haven.- Host Alisyn Camerota pressed Duffy on Trump claiming that the media were intentionally covering up terrorist attacks and either not reporting or underreporting them. The White House later Monday released a list of 78 attacks it said backed up Trump\\\\\\'s claim. The list notably did not include a recent attack on Muslims inside a Quebec City mosque that killed six people. Trump, who frequently tweets about terrorist attacks, also has not mentioned this one.- Duffy argued in his CNN interview that attacks by white people \"?such as the one in Quebec City \"?aren\"t as big of a problem.- \"You don\"t have a group like ISIS or al Qaeda that is inspiring people around the world to take up arms and kill innocents. That was a one-off. That was a one-off, Alisyn,\"?Duffy said. Camerota then pointed to the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, as acts carried out by white terrorists. Duffy tried to make lemonade out of the Charleston attack, in which a white supremacist killed nine people:- CAMEROTA: How about Charleston, congressman? He was an extremist. He was a white extremist?- DUFFY: Yes, he was. OK? CAMEROTA: How about that? That doesn\"t matter?- DUFFY: No, it does matter. It does matter. Look at the good things that came from it. [Then-South Carolina Gov.] Nikki Haley took down the Confederate flag, that was great.- But you want to say I can give you a couple of examples. There\\\\\\'s no constant threat that goes through these attacks. And you have radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS that are driving the attacks, and if you want to compare those two, maybe you can throw another one \"\\\\x95Â?CAMEROTA: You can.- Duffy claimed that people on the left were manufacturing outrage, saying there was plenty of blame to go around.- \"Look at Gabby Giffords. The Marxist, who took her life, a leftist guy, and now you see violence and terror in the streets all across America, burning and beating people with Donald Trump hats. The violence you have to look in, you\\\\\\'r trying to use examples on the right,\"?he said. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) is not dead. As a congresswoman in 2011, she survived an assassination attempt, and she remains an outspoken proponent of gun safety reform. Duffy said he be happy to help do something about white supremacy but he just didn\"t know what to do: \"Can we vet that? How should we vet that to keep ourselves safe? I will join you in that effort, what do you do?\"?- Watch Duffy\\\\\\'s full interview below:- Camerota: Why isn\\\\\\'t the president talking about white terrorism? Duffy: There\\\\\\'s a difference. https://t.co/YEgSitUsdS The Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked radical-right terrorist plots that have occurred since the Oklahoma City bombing and has a list here.- There have been zero fatal terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since 1975 by immigrants from the seven countries listed in Trump\\\\\\'s executive order. The order restricts travelers from those countries from coming to the U.S. for 90 days, prevents refugees from all countries from entering the U.S. for 120 days and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely.

If disappointing websites, drug-resistant STIs and troublingly short attention spans weren\"t enough to make us lose our minds (and possibly our libidos), we\\\\\\'r also now stuck grappling with another modern phenomenon: ghosting. The New York Times defines ghosting as \"ending a romantic relationship by cutting off all contact and ignoring the former partner\\\\\\'s attempts to reach out.\"?This has happened to me three times in the past year. Granted, I don\"t believe it necessarily needs to be a \"relationship\"?in the traditional sense in order for one party to be ghosted. It could (or should) also include entanglements that involved meeting up or hanging out or hooking up with someone two or more times before the other person vanished without a trace. I haven\"t been in a formal relationship in almost four years, but I frequently meet guys that I find worthy of getting to know better (both with and without my clothes on) and the exchanges that result from those interactions are meaningful to me in one way or another \"?at least meaningful enough to want some closure if or when they end. After investing some time and energy and possibly saliva or other body fluids in another person, it\\\\\\'s disconcerting when they suddenly disappear. Of course, if you\\\\\\'re only been on one or two \"dates\"?(however you want to define that term) with someone and at the end of your time together neither of you reaches out to the other, that\\\\\\'s not ghosting. That\\\\\\'s just life.-And I understand that dating is hard and that finding someone who ticks \"?or if we\\\\\\'r really lucky, tickles \"?all of our boxes is virtually impossible but I still (perhaps naively) cling to the (perhaps now radical and totally outdated) idea that it\\\\\\'s a mature move to give someone a heads up if you\\\\\\'r going to stop talking or seeing or fucking them. So, in light of my experiences over the past year, here are a few humble and totally unscientific thoughts on ghosting: 1. Just don\"t do it. Be an adult and send a text that reads something like: \"Hey. Glad we hung out but I\\\\\\'m just not feeling a connection. Stay awesome\"?or whatever other generic and possibly hurtful or patronizing or maybe just uncomfortable (but at least emotionally clear) and instructive language you want to use. I\\\\\\'ll respect you for it even if it bums me out and that way neither of us has to dread randomly running into the other at Whole Foods or at that bar with all those vintage pinball machines that I stupidly and regretfully introduced you to because I thought you were cool (or at least we won\"t experience more than the usual basic human level of dread that accompanies those kinds of surprise social interactions). 2. If you do it, do not \"?as two of the three guys who originally ghosted me have done \"?start texting me again three to four weeks later and pretend like nothing happened as if you unexpectedly slipped into a coma and then suddenly woke up again or went on a hot air balloon trip around the world and didn\"t have access to your phone and just forgot to tell me. The only thing worse than ghosting is re-materializing a month later \"?and I mean worse for both of us because at that point, I\"ve had all that time to think about how bad your taste in music actually is or question a million other questionable things you told me in our short time together and now that I\"ve thought about it, I don\"t want to see you again. 3. Being ghosted made me realize I\"ve probably ghosted guys in the past-(and now that I\\\\\\'m publishing this piece, I\\\\\\'m guessing one or two or 74 of you will come forward and say as much). If I ghosted you, I\\\\\\'m sorry. I was an asshole. I was immature. And I was probably scared of hurting your feelings or just didn\"t know how to verbalize why I didn\"t want to see you again. Chances are it was something innocuous and had nothing to do with your character. And I\\\\\\'m sure if you asked any of the guys who ghosted me, they say exactly the same things. But that doesn\"t excuse it and going forward I\\\\\\'m vowing taking my own advice, no matter how awkward it might feel. 4. Human beings are finicky creatures and, what\\\\\\'s more, as our cultural ideas about and understanding of what dating and relationships and couples and families look like continues to shift and destabilize,-linking up and breaking apart is probably only going to get trickier. These days many of us aren\"t looking to get married or have kids (or at least aren\"t looking to get married and have kids the way our parents or our grandparents-did) and so, the way we think about how we enter and exit relationships is mutating and not always in ideal ways, which means we have to be even more mindful of our (in)actions. 5. Communicating is hard \"?and getting harder.-As much as I think the guys who ghosted me suck, I get it. And in many ways, aside from reminding me to treat others the way I\\\\\\'d like to be treated, being ghosted also has made me rethink who and what I\\\\\\'m looking for in a partner or a fuck buddy \"?or just someone I want to go and have a donut with. What\\\\\\'s more, it\\\\\\'s made me rethink how I communicate with other human beings in general and reevaluate what the best way is to express myself and my needs and my desires to friends and family and colleagues, too.

His blood is clumping up and they found crystals that seem engineered in the blood using an electron microscope. then today i read this.. remote influencing.. As we all know all electronic circuits need power, in the case of Remote Influencing Psychotronic Generators provide this power. Tim Rifat has developed the Psychotronic Generator from simple Pavlita generators to the far future Bone Generators(TM) using your own skull and bones as Psychotronic Crystal Generators. These Bone Generators(TM) change the Quantum Wave Function of reality, Remote Influencing. The science of Remote Influencing is based on quantum mechanics only Tim Rifat has developed science to explain Remote Influencing. The process is to decohere the Quantum Wave Function, decollapse it and return it to it\\'s quantum vacuum grand state, modify the Quantum Wave Function to the remote influenced event, collapse it using hyperinfinity so it manifests as your remote influenced event. (see www.supernaturalspirit.com Services for full explanation). In effect we zap the thing to be changed make it vanish and remanifest it as the event we went in laymans language; this takes energy supplied by Psychotronic Amplifiers in your Psychotronic Bone Generators(TM) as well as hyperinfinity the operator that holds the new event in being supplied by your Bone Generators(TM). Only one event can be carried out at a time (explained on www.psychicpowergambling.com) so Tim Rifat has arranged to quantum mechanically change your skeleton into Bone Psychotronic Generators(TM) for one specific event and give you the energy and Psychotronic Fuel with the hyperinfinity to manifest 12 of these singular events after which your Bone Generators which are acting as Psychotronic Batteries run out of energy. ive experienced temporal effects both physical and mental in being attacked by some kind of possibly similar technology. i have no dount im on a similar program as magnus. i get tortured bad. thats all ill say.\"\\n \\'The Orthodox Union, one of the largest-networks of Orthodox Jewish synagogues in America, recently adopted a policy that bans women from serving as clergy.- Opinions about whether women should be allowed to serve as clergy have caused some division within America\\\\\\'s Modern Orthodox Jewish community. The religious establishment, including the OU\\\\\\'s counterpart, the Rabbinical Council of America,-is strongly opposed to women\\\\\\'s ordination.-On the other hand, some OU synagogues have embraced the idea of women clergy. The new policy attempts to clear up the confusion. But despite the enforcement of this glass ceiling, Orthodox women who have felt the pull to serve as spiritual leaders aren\"t backing away from their calling.- Rabba Sara Hurwitz is the co-founder and Dean of Yeshivat Maharat, an-Orthodox Jewish seminary that ordains women as clergy. The school has graduated 14 female clergy and 28 others are currently students. Hurwitz told The Huffington Post that nine of the their graduates are currently employed in synagogues. She said students remain committed to \"learning, teaching, being a pastoral presence for people in their time joy and vulnerability, and being a role model for others.\"?\"their reaction [to the policy] is to keep marching forwards, fulfilling their passion to become clergy,\"?she wrote in an email. The OU\\\\\\'s decision comes down to a difference in opinion about God\\\\\\'s will for men and women. According to a statement, OU leaders said that they had been approached by Orthodox rabbis and lay leadership for definitive guidance about women\\\\\\'s ordination. The OU placed the question in front of a group of seven modern Orthodox rabbis. After months of reviews and forums with community members, the panel concluded that more should be done to encourage women towards leadership positions. However, their interpretation of Jewish law found that men and women have-different gender roles and obligations when it comes to serving in a synagogue. OU leaders argued that the idea of gender equality in religious practice \"inexorably clashes\"?with the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish scripture. In their worldview, individual autonomy must always submit to the will of God, as interpreted by rabbinic leaders. The rabbis agreed that women can serve as administrators, educators, and counselors. They can even advise other women about Jewish law as it relates to marriage, sexuality and women\\\\\\'s health.- But on the matter of ordination, the rabbis concluded that women weren\"t allowed. As a result, the OU adopted a policy on February 1 that discourages-member synagogues from employing-women clergy, or allowing women to perform tasks typically associated with clergy \"\\\\x95Â\\\\xa0such as officiating at significant life-cycle events, delivering sermons from the pulpit, and serving as a synagogue\\\\\\'s primary religious teacher. Instead of focusing on what women are prohibited from doing, the leaders asked the community to focus on what women are allowed to do.- \"Women must be encouraged to share their Torah knowledge, and their enthusiasm and wisdom, with the broader community,\"?the leaders said in a statement. \"Let us focus our energy and communal creativity on increasing and enhancing the contributions that women make to our shuls and communities, rather than being consumed with limitations.\"?But some female Orthodox clergy are determined not to let these restrictions stop them from acting as spiritual leaders. Maharat Ruth Balinsky Friedman, an ordained spiritual leader at Washington D.C.\\\\\\'s Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue, told The Huffington Post that she\\\\\\'s determined to keep doing her job. \"I am grateful to have an extremely supportive community, and so this decision does not affect me personally. However, some of my colleagues are personally affected, and this decision caused them a lot of upset and worry,\"?she told The Huffington Post in an email. \"therefore, my top reaction is one of anger.-That these rabbis made this decision without considering the effects it would have on the women who are currently serving as clergy, or who are training to serve, is disgraceful.\"?The OU\\\\\\'s statement does not explicitly state whether the rabbinic panel listened to ordained women\\\\\\'s voices and opinions during the review process. The Huffington Post\\\\\\'s requests for comment were not returned. The Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, a group that advocates for expanded roles for women within the community, was \"dismayed\"?by the OU\\\\\\'s decision.- \"there are various ways of practicing Judaism, halachic Orthodox Judaism,\"?Sharon Weiss-Greenberg, the group\\\\\\'s executive director, told the Forward. \"We are disappointed, however, that the OU is attempting to squash that healthy debate and impose their [religious ruling] on hundreds of synagogues, thus centralizing power\"?and not giving autonomy to communities\"?lay and professional leaders.\"?Bracha Jaffe, a member of Yeshivat Maharat\\\\\\'s Class of 2017, is still hoping to take the title of \"rabba\"?after her ordination this year. She told The Huffington Post that she feels the forum doesn\"t reflect the diversity within the Orthodox community. She said the OU\\\\\\'s decision has encouraged her and her colleagues to \"do our work in a more public fashion\"?to raise their visibility.- \"\\\\x9cVisible female clergy presence in Orthodox synagogues lends validity to women\\\\\\'s participation, gives voice to the women\\\\\\'s side and creates a welcoming space and role models for women of all ages in our synagogues,\"?Jaffe told The Huffington Post. \"Let us not deprive the Orthodox world of what these talented and dedicated women have to offer!\"?,-1\"\\'\\n \"BY AHT Staff Iraqi Forces Recapture Southern Front of Mosul, Kill over 950 ISIS Militants Iraqi forces managed to win back full control of Mosul\\'s Southern front, killing over 950 ISIS terrorists. 10 Shares 0 1 \\\\nFederal police chief General Shaker Jodat said late Friday government troops had purged 1,850 square kilometers of Mosulâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Southern front of ISIS militants and freed more than 10,000 families, the al-Sumaria news website reported. \\\\nThe Iraqi soldiers destroyed 25 car bombs, 83 motorbike bombs, 92 explosive belts and some vehicles equipped with weapons and missiles during their advances in the area, Jodat added. \\\\nHe further noted that police forces had confiscated 36 mortar shells containing chemicals. \\\\nOn Thursday, Joint Operations Command announced that the security forces continue liberating six areas in the western coast of the city of Mosul. \\\\nThe command said in a press statement, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cTroops of Federal Policed in the southwest axis of Nineveh managed, today, to fully liberate al-Ezba village,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d adding that, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnti-Terrorism forces in the eastern axis continue liberating the areas of Adan, al-Bakr, al-Zahabiya, al-Khadraâ\\\\x80\\\\x99, al-Qadisiyah al-Oula and al-Tahrir.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cTroops of al-Hashd al-Shaabi in the western axis managed to besiege Tel Afar Airport, and continue the cleansing operations inside the airport,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the statement added. \\\\nJoint security forces, backed by Army Aviation and international coalition continue their advance in the battle launched in 17 October 2016, to liberate the city of Mosul.

The daughter of a caliph, Wallada eventually inherited her father\\\\\\'s palace and transformed it into a literary hall where she\\\\\\'dmentor young women of all backgrounds in poetry and the arts. Her poems mixed themes of spiritual worship and erotic yearning \"?sometimes exalting her beloved, other times scolding the lovers who had done her wrong. She wrote: \"I am made for higher goals and by Allah I am going my way with pride. I allow my lover to touch my cheek And bestow my kiss to him who craves it.\"When Irish born, London-based actress R¨®is¨ªn O\\\\\\'Loughlin unexpectedly encountered Wallada\\\\\\'s poems last year, she was struck by how contemporary they felt. \"they read like the best pop lyrics,\"?O\\\\\\'Loughlin said in a statement. \"Short and sweet in their intense defiance, desire, lovesick longing, pride and fun.\"?In an email to The Huffington Post,-O\\\\\\'Loughlin said they reminded her of the songs of contemporary songstress FKA Twigs, who infuses her erotic lyrics with hints of spiritual reverence.- Astounded by her discovery, O\\\\\\'Loughlin began to research other women poets from the ancient Arab world. She landed upon the collection of Abdullah al-Udhari, comprised of verses written by women between the 7th and 12th centuries. Like Wallada, the other ancient poets spun verses that praised pleasures both carnal and divine with the same fearless breath.-One piece by 11th-century poet Itimad al-Rumaykiyya reads: \"I urge you to come faster than the wind to mount my breast and firmly dig and plough my body, and don\"t let go until you\\\\\\'re flushed me thrice.\"?Lyrics like these \"?lavish and unapologetic \"?contradict the persistent, patriarchal myths that cast women, and especially women of Muslim faith, as submissive or silent. These ancient Arabic poets revealed that for millennia, women of various backgrounds, classes and faiths have expressed their feelings and beliefs in no uncertain terms, through passages that vibrate with conviction and lust, sometimes directed toward another person, and alternately, toward life itself.- \"I was really attracted to the poems, in part, because they didn\"t have any agenda,\"?O\\\\\\'Loughlin told HuffPost. \"Today the idea of empowerment is sold to us. It\\\\\\'s become an advertising tool used to sell dresses or soap. These artists, their way of speaking, just felt really free. They felt like celebrations of life.\"?Inspired by these visionary poets whose words still resonate centuries later,-O\\\\\\'Loughlin brainstormed how to usher this little-known pocket of ancient, erotic feminist literature into contemporary discussions, in a time so many of the stereotypes regarding femininity, Islam and the Arab World still persist. She decided to match present-day artists with their poetic predecessors, inviting women of today to create visual testimonies to accompany the written works that came before them.- O\\\\\\'Loughlin collected 24 total poems from Arabic women poets \"?most are Muslim, though one is Jewish and one predates Islam. She recruited two female contemporary artists from different cultural and artistic traditions to craft an artistic responses to each poem. The resulting exhibition, called \"radical Love: Female Lust,\"?features 48 artworks made by women around the world, approximately half of whom are of Arab descent. Hailing from countries including Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, America, Pakistan and Ghana, the featured artists use ancient Arabic poetry as a point of departure, visualizing desire and worship in a dizzying array of manifestations.- The show will take place at the Crypt Gallery in London, a former burial ground located beneath a church. According to O\\\\\\'Loughlin, \"Here the words of these poets who have been silenced are given voice again, and in doing so the desire for life that is present in the female rises in the work of the modern artist.\"?The curator funded the entire exhibition herself, and is currently crowdfunding on Generosity to help with the cost. She hopes to earn enough to divide all proceeds from the show between the participating artists and the Global Fund for Women,-helping Syrian refugees who have relocated to Lebanon.- The image above, a print by by Saudi artist Hend al-Mansour, was inspired by the poet Juml, a young Bedouin woman who, in 9th-century Iraq, served as a concubine to poet Idris Ibn Abi Hafsah. Al-Mansour riffed off the style of the Arabic storybook Maqamat Badi\"?al-Zaman al-Hamadhani,-adding splashes of neon pink and her heroine\\\\\\'s salty expression.- Another work, by Dublin-based photographer Deborah Sheedy titled \"I Keep my Passion to Myself,\"?was inspired by a poem by Zahra. Her airy, black-and-white photo depicts a woman spinning in a white dress, appearing like something between an embodied human and imagined chimera. The photo-\"?blurred and bubbling from the edges \"?transforms what photographers often construe as mistakes into opportunities for additional experimentation and play.- The motley assemblage of artists have a few things in common:-urgency, a desire to express core emotions like strength, vulnerability and love. \"they are a deliberate and timeless resistance to the silencing and patronizing of females,\"?O\\\\\\'Loughlin added. \"Whatever external restraints were placed on these women, they retained a vitality and independence of spirit, a powerful tonic to these troubling times.\"O\\\\\\'Loughlin originally began researching ancient Arabic poetry in 2015 -Before Brexit, before Trump\\\\\\'s election, and before the president\\\\\\'s-executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations. Islamophobia and the xenophobic myths that such thinking engenders were palpable then. \"I was shocked by Brexit and I was shocked by Donald Trump being elected,\"?she said. \"But I was aware that people were being reduced to their ethnicity or their faith.\"?Through her exhibition, O\\\\\\'Loughlin hoped to reveal the futility of defining human beings through such sweeping labels,-demonstrating the depth and difference that exist within every cultural category.- \"It\\\\\\'s crazy that the word \"Muslim\"?is being described to define millions of people who are from different places and cultures,\"?O\\\\\\'Loughlin continued. \"people from Pakistan or Palestine or Algeria come from such distinct cultures. And every single woman has a different relationship to God.\"?Subsequently, the featured artists in her exhibition do not disclose their faiths alongside their work. That, O\\\\\\'Loughlin expressed, is an aspect of themselves they are not compelled to explain to anyone. \"they are women and artists, that\\\\\\'s all they have to be.\"?Radical Love: Female Lust-is on view Crypt Gallery, St Pancras, London from Feb. 14 through March 5. The show will raise money for The Global Fund for Women helping Syrian refugees.-\\'\\n \\'link This guy didn\\\\\\'t even win re-election but he think\\\\\\'s he\\\\\\'s got a mandate of some sort to take up arms if the candidate he supports doesn\\\\\\'t win in November?

Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump\\'s IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father\\'s money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump\\'s fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn\\'t seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental.

When the police arrived at the scene, they didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t find Kubek at his home â\\\\x80\\\\x93 however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. \\\\nThe police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. \\\\nAccording to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter \\\\nThe News-Herald reported: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said â\\\\x80\\\\x9cyes.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIn response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nYes, a grown man used a gun because he felt â\\\\x80\\\\x9coutnumberedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t be trusted with firearms! Kubekâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hearing is scheduled for December 5th â\\\\x80\\\\x93 letâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner.

Canadians to me seem less radical, less extreme, and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women. Canada, after all, accepted our draft dodgers of the â\\\\x80\\\\x9970s who questioned the morality and justness of the Vietnam War. To me, that was something to be lauded. Imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a 30-year career, who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility, had been suspended without pay, apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first.\\\\nHallâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two American academics, Steven Salaita and Norman Finkelstein. Both were openly critical of Zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous Arab populations of the Occupied Territories. Both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of Palestinian rights and lost their jobs.\\\\nI adjure the not to take a page out of the American playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world. Please live up to the values of the wiser, more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for Americans like myself.\\\\nTeresa Ghannam\\\\nSacramento, Calif.\\\\nRecommended For You Dear Vice Chancellor Kamran: Salam from the East coast of Canada.

And you are the duly-elected symbol of that country. You may not know that I love my country, since I\\\\\\'m not in the pro-life movement, I don\\\\\\'t attend church, fear immigrants, or verbally wave the flag every chance I get. I\\\\\\'m not even Christian, which I suspect is becoming ground zero for patriotism. In fact, I pretty much don\\\\\\'t fit any of the recent descriptions used for those who love our country. My love of country stems, instead, from deep, unwavering gratitude. Gratitude that my parents were allowed to emigrate here, and that this country made room for them. Gratitude that I was given a childhood that was dramatically different than theirs. Gratitude that my life choices were those of people who have enough food to eat, a home to live in, and a government that protects them and not hunts them down. I had only to decide which clothes to wear for school that day, which homework assignment should be done first, and which children\\\\\\'s shows I would look forward to seeing on TV over the weekend. These were decisions my parents never got to consider when they were growing up. I also love my country because my experience growing up was that people of different religions living together was entirely normal. My friends were Jewish, Protestant, Catholic. We attended the same school, borrowed books from the same library, watched movies on Saturday morning at the same theater. My parents did not experience this. Because of their religion, they lived only where the government allowed them to live. Their lives were so insular that they never learned the languages of the countries in which they lived. This is what I\\\\\\'d like you to understand, that, because of who I am and because of the circumstances of my family history, I love my country. You and I speak the same language, and we may use the same terms, but I may mean something a bit different than you when I do so. For example: pro-life: My belief is that life is sacred, and that being pro-life means that we have an obligation to those, like my parents, who seek asylum within our borders. And we have an obligation to those who live here now, to be inclusive. Pro-life means not shutting them out, either economically, socially, or educationally. I do not believe that they are here to suck us dry or kill us. I believe they are, like my parents, here to have a chance at a better life. \"radical Islamic terrorism\": a favorite term of yours. You\\\\\\'ll be happy to know that I believe radical Islamic terrorism exists and that it is a threat to us and to the world. I also believe radical non-Islamic terrorism exists. It has resulted in Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing, Dylann Roof and the Charleston Church shooting, Adam Lanza and the Newtown School shooting, Charles Roberts and the Amish school shooting, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and the Columbine High School massacre. The list goes on and on. Terrorism, no matter its motivation, is unacceptable. \"government-run education monopoly\" Democracies depend on the educational system they provide their citizens. Corporations that are monopolies have consumers at their mercy, and may set prices to increase profit. They don\\\\\\'t have to consider the welfare of the people who use their products or services. Education, as a monopoly, ensures that common standards are upheld. They are beholden to the people who use their services. There is a big difference between a business and an educational system. People of means will always have the option of sending their children to private school, just as people of faith will always have the option of sending their children to faith-based school. And people will (and should) have the option of home-schooling or sending their children to charter schools. But none of these alternatives should impact in any way whatsoever on the public school system that the vast majority of Americans attend. Alternatives mean choice, not the standard. \"fake news\": I agree wholeheartedly that fake news exists. But, in this era of unlimited avenues in which people can gather information, it\\\\\\'s irresponsible to accept any news (no matter where it comes from) without checking sources. If you limit yourself solely to one source or one way of thinking, you become vulnerable to manipulation. And that is a very dangerous place to be. A free society is based on a free press. It is not up to any leader of this country to decide what people should read and/or listen to. It is up to us, the people,to do due diligence to weed through news sources, in order to make ourselves better-informed citizens. I also have definitions that differ from yours, regarding what it would take to \"make America great again\" and \"make the inner cities safe\" and \"keep our borders safe.\" I will happily share them with you, if you\\\\\\'d like. So, here\\\\\\'s your Valentine, POTUS, from a grateful-to-be-here patriot of this amazing country. I suspect that no matter what path you choose to lead this country down for the foreseeable future, I will make my opinion known. I will continue to exercise the right that was not given to my parents. And I will continue to love this country as much as anyone possibly can and to get chills whenever I say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem.\\'\\n \\'link The oligarchy runs our society with Problem â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Reaction â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Solution.

Harry Reid: Obamacare \\\\\\'Absolutely\\\\\\' A Step Toward A Single-Payer System When I speak to conservatives about health care policy, Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m often asked the question: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think that Obamacare is secretly a step toward single-payer health care?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d I always explain that, while progressives may want single-payer, I donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t think that Obamacare is deliberately designed to bring about that outcome.

His answer? â\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes.

Thanks Obama?\\'\\n \\'5 Shares\\\\n4 0 0 1\\\\nSo-called liberals and leftists in the US and around the world, are now wailing and gnashing their teeth in reaction to Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s crushing defeat. They are, however, the first to blame for the outcome of the US presidential elections. Their candidate, Hillary Clinton, was the embodiment of a totally corrupt political system. She is a hypocrite par excellence, talking to the bankiers of Wall Street behind closed doors differently than to the American people. Her rhetoric for the rights of women and blacks and other minorities sounded disingenuous. The Clinton Foundation received large donations from Saudi-Arabia and Qatar, countries rewarded in return by huge arms transfers overseen by her as Secretary of State. Her involvement in this corruption was no theme for the media. According to emails published by WikiLeaks, her campaign manager John Podesta was or is on the payroll of the Saudis. All of this was not considered worth reporting by the media. Virtually all national media in the United States supported Clinton\\\\\\'s candidacy. Instead of reporting how the machinery of the Democratic Party and the Clinton team stole the primary elections to prevent the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the media demonized Donald Trump.\\\\nI do not wish here to defend Donald Trump. He made numerous stupid, racist, sexist, and anti-Islamic statements that were rightly criticized. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, was treated with kid gloves while her huge criminal political record was glossed over. Instead of coming to grips with their abject failures, the liberals and their media continue in slandering Donald Trump. Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s first declarations show already that he has conquered new frontiers.\\\\nAn American President is not a free and politically independent person. From day one, a President-elect can\\\\\\'t anymore go around the corner and grab a hot dog or a hamburger. He is reigned in by a military and security establishment that holds the President fit for public consumption. Trump, as any other president, can be expected to follow their rule and political suggestions.\\\\nI doubt very much that Trump will keep the promises of his election campaign, such as building a wall along the American-Mexican border, deport all illegal immigrants or ban Muslims from immigrating into the US. I even doubt that he will go after Hillary Clinton and her husband\\\\\\'s dubious foundation. There exists a code of honor among thieves.\\\\nTrump won precisely because of the shrill one-sided media propaganda and because of his rhetoric against the Washington establishment, including his own Republican Party. Now, this Republican establishment dominates both houses of Congress. Trump belongs also, however, to the US establishment but of another sort. Nobody should believe that the Washington establishment will follow Trump\\\\\\'s lead. Even his positive statements about Vladimir Putin or his suggestion to discard NATO, will probably vanish. But what I do hope is that he stands to his rejection of TPP and TTIP and his pragmatic view of Vladimir Putin.\\\\nMORE...

Not Much and Here\\\\\\'s Why Clinton\\\\\\'s Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans Whether Trump will stop American adventurism in the Middle East has to be seen. His close ties with Netanyahu do not bode well for the Palestinians. He sees Zionist colonization of the rest of Palestine as no hindrance to peace. And while he has promised to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, I doubt that he will carry out this provocation against international law and the entire Muslim world.\\\\nThe German political and media class was not only surprised by the results of the US elections, but did not even try to hide its revulsion against the choice of the American people. The entire political class in Germany perceived and presented the Trump campaign in the same one-sided manner as American media did. Chancellor Angela Merkel sent the President-Elect Trump a warning in the guise of a congratulation. Her political impudence was garbed within obsequious blabber about the allegedly honorable nature of German-American ties: \"Germany and America are bound by common values â\\\\x80\\\\x94 democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views. It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation, both with me personally and between our countriesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 governments.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Other German politicians did not even attempt to hide their disdain for American voters by diplomatic language. Germanyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Foreign Minister Steinmeier called Trump a \"preacher of hate\", and Deputy Chancellor Gabriel cartooned Trump as a â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctrailblazer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement... [who wants] a rollback to the bad old times in which women belonged by the stove or in bed, gays in jail and unions at best at the side table.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d During the election campaign, Trump called Merkel\\\\\\'s mass-immigration policy \"insane\" and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat Merkel did to Germanyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d a â\\\\x80\\\\x9csad shameâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d.\\\\nThe media and the political class should at this point stop pontificating. Their double morals and unprofessional coverage of the US elections should prompt them to more humility. They should rather blame themselves for their biased reporting, which led directly to Clinton\\\\\\'s defeat. Ordinary Americans are not as stupid as the Establishment wants us to believe. Established parties and media would be well advised to give the new US President a chance to prove his worth. There will be, without doubt, many occasions in the future for fact-based criticism.\\'\\n \\'By Michael Maharrey The federal government ratcheted up its game of chicken with states over REAL ID last month, threatening once again to ban residents... \\'\\n \\'Secret messages hidden within the SPAM of the Podesta Emails ? page: 1 link Good morning ATS!

MPs rejected a bid by Labour\\\\\\'s Chris Leslie to force the government to consult Parliament on the deal struck with the EU before it is finalised. It came after ministers pledged that a \"meaningful\" vote would be offered. Labour and some Tories had pushed for MPs to have a decisive say on the final terms, but the 326 to 293 vote means the bill remains unchanged. MPs are still debating other elements of the draft legislation, which will authorise the prime minister to formally begin Brexit negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Theresa May has already promised Parliament will get a say on the final deal, but critics, including some Conservatives, said they wanted more than the \"take it or leave it\" vote being offered. Any possibility of a Conservative rebellion appeared to be halted by comments from Brexit Minister David Jones. Mr Jones said MPs would get a say on the final draft Brexit agreement before it was voted upon by the European Parliament. \"This will be a meaningful vote,\" he told MPs. \"It will be the choice of leaving the EU with a negotiated deal or not.\" However, some MPs questioned whether any concessions had in fact been offered. Asked what would happen if Parliament rejected the Brexit deal or if there was no agreement with the EU to vote upon, Mr Jones said that in each scenario the UK would still leave the EU but \"fall back on other arrangements\". This would effectively see the UK default to World Trade Organization trade rules, involving potential tariffs on exports and imports. Opponents of Brexit have said this would cause real damage to British business, but supporters say the UK can live with the consequences if necessary as the UK would then be free to negotiate its own trade arrangements. Mr Jones said the government wanted to avoid a situation in which ministers were sent back to the negotiating table to hammer out a better deal. This, he said, would be hard given the two-year limit for talks and would also be \"the surest way of undermining our negotiating position and delivering a worse deal\". Former chancellor Ken Clarke - the only Tory to vote against kickstarting the Brexit process last week - said Parliament should have the opportunity to shape the final deal, while former SNP leader Alex Salmond said MPs should have a genuine choice without the \"Sword of Damocles\" hanging over them. Labour\\\\\\'s Chuka Umunna said the choice facing MPs was \"unacceptable\", Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg described it as a \"symbolic handout\" while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said MPs were being \"duped\". But Labour\\\\\\'s font bench claimed the move as a \"significant victory\" in response to its repeated demands for a \"meaningful\" vote at the end of the two-year negotiation process. The party withdrew its proposed amendment before Mr Leslie\\\\\\'s was defeated. MPs, who overwhelmingly backed the European Union Bill last Wednesday, are currently in the middle of three further days of more detailed debate, with the Commons looking at amendments proposed by MPs. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who backed the Remain side in last year\\\\\\'s EU referendum, has ordered his MPs to support the government\\\\\\'s bill, whether his party\\\\\\'s amendments are accepted or not. If passed by Parliament - with the House of Lords due to scrutinise it after the Commons - the bill would allow Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting divorce talks with the EU under way. Mr Corbyn argues that it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people, as expressed in last June\\\\\\'s EU referendum. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has vowed to oppose the bill unless Labour amendments are passed in the Commons. Frontbench members of parties are generally expected to resign from their post if they ignore a three-line whip.\\'\\n \\'Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended voicing his opposition to Donald Trump addressing Parliament. His comments, including accusing the US president of \"racism and sexism\", had been made \"honestly and honourably\" and were within his remit, he told MPs. Several Conservatives have criticised the Speaker, one saying his career could be in \"jeopardy\" and another that he had damaged the national interest. Downing Street called his comments \"a matter for Parliament\". The US president has accepted an invitation from the Queen for a state visit to the UK, which can include an address to both Houses of Parliament, later this year. However, responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday, Mr Bercow said he was opposed to Mr Trump speaking to MPs and peers - as some other international leaders have done. He said it was \"not an automatic right\", but an \"earned honour\", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs. Questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about his remarks, he replied: \"The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters.\" He added: \"I was honestly and honourably seeking to discharge my responsibilities to the House.\" Mr Bercow said it was time \"to move on to other matters\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said there had been a \"rather subdued aspect\" among his party\\\\\\'s MPs when Mr Bercow had spoken. He added: \"I do hope that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality, because that\\\\\\'s the way for the House to proceed.\" The \"relationship between the United Kingdom and United States is an extremely important one\", Sir Gerald also said. However, Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Commons owed Mr Bercow \"a debt of gratitude for deciding that in this case such an invitation should not be supported by this House.\" And SNP MP Alex Salmond, who had several run-ins with Mr Trump when he was Scottish First Minister, told Mr Bercow: \"If ever a statement deserved clapping, then yours did yesterday.\" Mr Bercow is one of three \"key holders\" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump\\\\\\'s predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. Lord Fowler addressed peers on Tuesday, saying Mr Bercow had not informed him ahead of voicing his opinion on Mr Trump, adding that Mr Bercow had told him he was \"genuinely sorry\" for this. He added: \"I don\\\\\\'t intend to argue the case for or against Mr Trump\\\\\\'s visit. That\\\\\\'s not my role as Speaker. \"But let me say I have spent the last 30 years campaigning against discrimination, particularly against LGBT people and people with HIV/Aids.\" As speaker, Mr Bercow is the highest authority of the House of Commons and must remain politically impartial. Several senior Conservatives have been highly critical of his comments. One unnamed Tory MP and former cabinet member told the BBC he \"must be close to standing down\" as Speaker, while another said his remarks had gone \"way beyond what is acceptable\". Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: \"When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy.\" Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with \"the consequences\" of his comments. He added that the Speaker, \"who\\\\\\'s meant to referee all of this, should keep himself above that\". What is a state visit? Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told Sky News: \"It was a performance, it was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest. I think it is regrettable that he did it.\" Fellow Conservative Nadhim Zahawi, who has been critical of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s travel ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries, said the Speaker prided himself on his neutrality and to become the story was \"a bad place to be\". He said Mr Bercow had opened himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after allowing other controversial leaders, like the Chinese president, to speak, and urged him to explain his thinking to MPs. Meanwhile, Joe Wilson, a Congressman for Mr Trump\\\\\\'s republican Party, told the BBC\\\\\\'s Newsnight programme Mr Bercow\\\\\\'s interjection had been \"very disappointing\". \"If ever in recent years there\\\\\\'s been a more pro-British president of the United States, it\\\\\\'s Donald Trump,\" he said. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bercow had \"abused his position\" and that to have expressed his opinions in the way he did \"devalues this great office\". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has called for the state visit to be postponed, welcomed the intervention, while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was \"not welcome\". A petition to withdraw the invitation to the US president - and another one backing the visit - will be debated by MPs later this month. No date for Mr Trump\\\\\\'s visit has been announced.\\'\\n \"9 Shares\\\\n8 0 0 1\\\\nLast July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That â\\\\x80\\\\x98declarationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland.\\\\nIt is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action.\\\\nHowever, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017 .\\\\nBut who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today?\\\\nBritain\\'s Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild.\\\\nMORE... Palestineâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s reality: Al Nakba commemoration and the right of return or the return of the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement? To be a child in Palestine, where Israel has killed more children than the total number of goals scored in all FIFA World Cups Let There Be Water: Israel\\'s policy of stolen water No hope and no heroes for Palestine At the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfourâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read:\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis Majesty\\'s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe concluded, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBalfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape.\\\\nOnly a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by FranÃ§ois Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake.\\\\nThe document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties.\\\\nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the â\\\\x80\\\\x98Asia Minor Agreementâ\\\\x80\\\\x99, was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them.\\\\nThe centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines.\\\\nThe improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of co-operation and conflict.\\\\nThe Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916.\\\\nWWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest.\\\\nBritish and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Belfour conveyed the British governmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil.\\\\nRarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot.\\\\nSo when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible.\\\\nStill, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians.\\\\nWhen the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years.\\\\nPaltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine â\\\\x80\\\\x93 which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions.\\\\nDespite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later.\\\\nIn fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it â\\\\x80\\\\x98Israelâ\\\\x80\\\\x99; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial.\\\\nWhile Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his â\\\\x80\\\\x98promiseâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 embodied - that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people â\\\\x80\\\\x93 that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations.\\\\nThat injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place.\"\\n \\'RAF fighter jets have been scrambled to divert a Pakistan International Airlines plane to Stansted Airport. Stansted said the flight from Lahore to Heathrow had landed in Essex at 14:50 GMT after being escorted by Typhoons. Essex Police said the diversion had been due to reports of a disruptive passenger and was \"not believed to be a hijack situation or terror matter\". In an unrelated matter, a passenger due to be arrested by police on arrival at Heathrow was held at Stansted instead. The Met said the 52-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of committing fraud offences in the UK and was being transferred to a London police station. The Airbus A330 was held away from the airport after its diversion and Pakistan International Airlines said passengers were provided with \"surface transport\" to London. Stansted remained open as usual throughout the incident. An Essex police spokesman said: \"An aircraft was diverted to Stansted Airport at around 3pm this afternoon while over UK airspace en route to Heathrow Airport due to reports of a disruptive passenger on board. \"The plane is currently at the airport and officers are making enquiries. There is no disruption to the ongoing operation of Stansted Airport.\" However, Pakistan International Airlines said in a statement that UK authorities had received \"some vague security threat through an anonymous phone call\" regarding the flight. Pakistan\\\\\\'s Civil Aviation Authority tweeted: \"#PIA flight bound for Heathrow from Lahore has been diverted to #Stansted due to reasons aboard the aircraft.\" The RAF confirmed that Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft had been scrambled from RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire. Stansted is a designated airport for dealing with hijacks and major security alerts. Such incidents are dealt with in a remote part of the airfield to the north-west of the terminal building.

Ian Stewart, 56, denies murdering his fiancee and dumping her body in order to inherit her money. Mr Stewart broke down in tears as he told jurors there was \"no way\" he was responsible for killing the Electra Brown writer. St Albans Crown Court heard he sent her texts while she was missing, begging her to return. Mr Stewart is accused of drugging and probably suffocating his bride-to-be as part of a plot to acquire her riches. He was repeatedly overcome by emotion as he recalled the early days of their relationship, saying: \"We totally clicked and worked together as a couple.\" The 51-year-old writer was last seen on 11 April and reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. She was found beneath the garage, together with that of her dachshund Boris, on 15 July. Mr Stewart denied knowing she had died until her body was found in a cesspit, Simon Russell Flint, defending, asked him: \"Did you have any knowledge of her death until you heard her body had been found?\" \"No,\" he replied. When it was suggested he had killed his fiancee, he responded: \"No way\". The former software engineer said he first met Ms Bailey on a Facebook group for widowers and widows following the death of his wife in 2010. The pair started out comforting each other over their losses - Ms Bailey\\\\\\'s first husband drowned in 2011 - but eventually began a relationship. \"We totally clicked and worked together as a couple,\" he told the court. \"I had fallen in love with her quite quickly but she warned me once to never say the L word. But then I went to hug her and I said it and she replied instantly, \\\\\\'I love you too\\\\\\'. \"I never stopped loving her.\" The prosecution alleges Mr Stewart murdered Northumberland-born Ms Bailey for her money. She was worth more than ?3.3m at the time of her death, the court heard. They also allege he disposed of her phone. Mr Stewart, of Baldock Road, Royston, also denies preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.\\'\\n \\'By Matt Agorist Students at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan got a hefty dose of the police state this week as they were... \\'\\n \\'The second video (bottom one ) proves what Trump is sayng is true , corruption with the Clinton gang is rife , he could use this in his arguments . http://www.opb.org/news/series/burns-oregon-standoff-bundy-militia-news-updates/ammon-bundy-verdict-oregon-standoff-malheur-court/   And lets not forget there were 15 undercover FBI infrmants doing the provications = set up . \\'\\n \\'The US Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump\\\\\\'s controversial nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, by the slenderest possible margin. US Vice-President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote to secure her cabinet role, splitting the chamber 50-50. It was the first time ever that a vice-president has interceded in such a way for a cabinet secretary. Mrs DeVos, a billionaire who has no experience with public schools, faced a rocky confirmation hearing last month. Moments after voting ended, she tweeted: \"I appreciate the Senate\\\\\\'s diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. \"Let\\\\\\'s improve options & outcomes for all US students.\" Senate Democrats staged a 24-hour debate into Tuesday to hold up her confirmation. They hoped their all-night speaking marathon would pressure more Republican senators to oppose the nomination, but their efforts were in vain. Mr Pence was also the first vice-president to cast a deciding vote in the Senate since 2008, when Dick Cheney voted on a tax adjustment plan. No Democrats voted in favour of Mrs DeVos. Two Republican senators stood by their plan to oppose her confirmation, leaving the Senate in a deadlock. In the end Donald Trump is going to get the team he wants. Betsy DeVos\\\\\\'s education secretary nomination looked a bit shaky for a while, but no Republican senator was willing to be the third \"no\" vote that would have sunk her. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\\\\\\'s ties to Russia made some conservatives uneasy, and prompted sharp questioning from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, but the former oil magnate\\\\\\'s party closed ranks behind him. The only real question mark left is labour secretary nominee Andrew Puzdner, whose confirmation hearings have been postponed four times amid reports that he has not fully disentangled himself from his sprawling fast-food business empire. If he withdraws, however, it will be quietly, before a confrontation with Democrats heats up. Democrats always faced an uphill battle in bringing down any of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s cabinet nominees, given the mathematical reality of being in the Senate minority. Republicans were loath to deal an early, embarrassing setback to the new president, possibly earning his long-term enmity. The fight over Mrs DeVos and other nominees has engaged the Democratic base, however. Now the question is whether they will stay engaged in the months and years ahead - or if this initial surge of activism will recede over time. Critics say Mrs DeVos, who advocates for charter schools, is not qualified to run the Department of Education. She faced intense scrutiny before a Senate committee in January, when she made headlines for noting that a Wyoming school might need a gun to defend against grizzly bears. Labour unions, rights groups and teaching organisations have also spoken out against her nomination. Groups including the American Federation of Teachers and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights held protests against Mrs DeVos outside of Congress on Monday evening. The 59-year-old is a wealthy Republican Party donor and a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman who has long campaigned for education reform in the state. Her husband Dick DeVos was a chief executive of the beauty and nutrition giant Amway and her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial private security company Blackwater. She is among several of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s cabinet picks whom Democrats have been trying to block from being approved. Democrats said in January they would target eight of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s nominees based on their lack of qualifications and policy positions. Before Mrs DeVos\\\\\\' approval, just six of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s cabinet picks had been confirmed, compared with former President Barack Obama\\\\\\'s 12 cabinet secretaries at this point in 2009 and 16 of George W Bush\\\\\\'s in 2001, according to the Washington Post. The slowed process is also partly due to the fact that some of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s picks have not completed a lengthy vetting process typically required of Cabinet candidates, which helps identify potential conflicts of interest. Hundreds of staff positions also remain vacant as the fate of 15 of Trump administration\\\\\\'s nominees hangs in the balance.\\'\\n \\'Former US President Barack Obama has enjoyed a spot of kitesurfing with Richard Branson.\\'\\n \\'By Janet Phelan A recent cancer symposium, with a surgical focus, met in Boston to discuss how surgical oncology is experiencing â\\\\x80\\\\x9can exciting evolution and... \\'\\n \"Another Arab supremacist masturbation fantasy. The world map was re-shaped after the fall of the Ottoman empire almost 100 years ago.

The Israelis have bent over backwards to try and accommodate them, and many Arabs would like to end the conflict, but the current politicos and lunatic blood-seeking writers like Baroud won\\'t be happy without another war, seeking a Jew-free Palestine.

The new housing strategy for England includes giving councils powers to pressurise developers to start building on land they own. Ministers also pledged to make renting more \"family-friendly\" with longer tenancies offered. Labour called the measures announced \"feeble beyond belief\". The government says at least 250,000 new homes are needed each year to keep pace with demand and councils and developers need to \"get real\" to the scale of the challenge. Mr Javid set out the details of the housing White Paper in a statement to MPs, with measures including: So-called starter homes, championed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, will be aimed at \"households that need them most\", those with combined incomes of less than ?80,000, or ?90,000 in London. Starter homes are new homes built for first-time buyers between 23 and 40 years old and sold at least 20% below market value. The maximum price after the discount has been applied is ?250,000 outside London and ?450,000 in the capital. Under the new proposals, starter home buyers will need a mortgage, \"to stop cash buyers\", and some or all of the discount will have to be repaid if the property is resold within 15 years, \"to reduce the risk of speculation\". A proposal that 20% of all larger developments had to be starter homes is to be dropped and replaced with a \"clear expectation\" that at least 10% of developments will be \"affordable home ownership units\". The 22-year-olds who bought their own home (without mum and dad\\\\\\'s help) Ruby Willard, a recruitment consultant, and engineer Sam Bardell bought a ?182,200 two-bedroom terraced house in Havant, Hampshire, last year. They took advantage of the government\\\\\\'s Help to Buy Isa, but to save for the ?18,000 deposit, it was a case of being \"quite tight\", she says. \"When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I\\\\\\'m not going to spend money elsewhere when I don\\\\\\'t need to... \"I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn ?55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage.\" Read how other 20-somethings managed to do it Mr Javid said: \"Walk down your local high street today and there\\\\\\'s one sight you\\\\\\'re almost certain to see: young people, faces pressed against the estate agent\\\\\\'s window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford. \"With prices continuing to skyrocket, if we don\\\\\\'t act now, a whole generation could be left behind. We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. \"The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live.\" Mr Javid admitted there was \"no one single magic bullet\" and there had to be a \"proper conversation about housing need\". Ministers have admitted the government is behind schedule in its efforts to build one million new homes in England by 2020. For Labour, shadow housing minister John Healey said: \"We hoped for better and we needed better. His disappointment will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with a housing crisis. It was feeble beyond belief.\" He added: \"We were promised a White Paper; we are presented with a white flag.\" The Lib Dems criticised the \"utterly vacuous\" proposals for not mentioning the government\\\\\\'s stated aim of a million new homes by 2020, a target ministers have insisted they are still aiming for. BBC home editor Mark Easton This government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt. The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed. Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as \"broken\" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it. But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a \"realistic plan\" to achieve that. Read more from Mark Former Conservative housing minister Grant Shapps told the BBC\\\\\\'s Daily Politics the problem would not be solved simply \"by slotting in a few more homes in converted former industrial sites\". He added: \"Housing ministers over the years have come out with documents or bills, and the truth is none of them are going to make much difference - and I don\\\\\\'t suppose this will make that much difference either. \"The reason is this - unless you build literally two, three, million more homes then you\\\\\\'re not going to solve the problem.\" The Local Government Association said the White Paper contained \"some encouraging signs\" on increasing housing supply and affordability. It welcomed the new \"flexibility\" around starter homes and called for new power and funding to allow councils to build affordable homes directly. The Campaign to Protect Rural England welcomed what it said was a focus on addressing current failings rather than \"meddling\" with the planning system. \"We are pleased that ministers have recognised that weakening the Green Belt is unnecessary,\" said chief executive Shaun Spiers. \"But with 360,000 houses already proposed for Green Belt land the government needs to do much more to uphold national policy and stop councils releasing it for development.\" Daniel Bentley, editorial director at the think tank Civitas, said: \"The problem is not sites with planning permission standing idle, except in limited circumstances. \"It is with sites that are being developed, but too slowly to get ahead of demand and make any difference to the affordability of housing.\" Graeme Brown, interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Shelter, said: \"The White Paper poses the right questions. What we need now is quick and bold action that helps people in need of a decent home tomorrow, not in 10 years.\" Where can I afford to live?

What is more, they are entirely appropriate to the situation. As we speak, proxy war is being fought by the destabilising forces of IS, sponsored by Western nations and interests by the back door, against the Assad regime. That regime is an ally of Russia. I am tired of pointing these things out, but to suggest that Russia is the problem, when for most of the last two decades, there has been western sponsored terrorism all over the most volatile region of the planet, smacks to me of the most unutterable witlessness. Russia is not the problem. I would not go as far as to say that it never was, and lets face it, the Russian government are not clean handed. But here is the thing... Russia cannot dishonour the British. It cannot dishonour the Americans. It can only make choices that make its nation look bad, and many of the choices it has made, with specific regard to its ACTUAL war effort against terror in Syria, have been absolutely legitimate, especially since they were not the cause of the problems there in the least. No... only OUR nations governments can dishonour us, and dishonour us they do. Every gun that makes its way from America and Britain, into the hands of a terrorist, dishonours us. Every time those weapons we sell the terrorists by the back door, are used to kill an innocent, we are dishonoured, stained with blood we would not wish to be shed. Our leaders, those of America and Britain not to mention other allies, THEY are the problem here. Their meddling, proxy warring, greed and hunger for power are the problem. They are the problem because we pay the taxes that make it possible. They are the problem because we did not give them permission to do these things in our name, because we would not want these things done in our name, and because they are supposed to be our representatives. No backstabbing, soft handed, work shy bastard represents me. No assemblage of schemers and game players represents me. No such mob represents my people on their best day, because on our best day the British people are not cold, evil, calculating and prepared to screw anyone to succeed. On our best day, even the least of us has more fair play and determination to do right than our government have. The same can be said a thousand fold for the leadership of the United States. We are not evil people, and yet we have allowed evil people to usurp the purpose of the tithe taken from our labour, to turn our effort, sweat and blood, into bloodshed overseas. We have had enemies made for us, by people we have mindlessly elected to positions with which they cannot be trusted. And we have the gall to be concerned about RUSSIA? I despair, I absolutely despair! This is not a game, this is not politics, this is real life. We should be doing better with it, and we are not. We should not be sliding ever further to the right, and yet we are. We should not be accepting the programming, and yet that is precisely what is happening all over the world, and in the OP of this very post. We MUST take back control of our governments. We MUST prevent our leaders from continuing these outmoded concepts of proxy war and destabilisation. We MUST mend the things our leaders broke in our name, we MUST take responsibility for those things, and we must NEVER allow them to happen again. In the meantime, we must leave Russia to deal with the crisis in Syria, so that the nation can be rebuilt, its infrastructure repaired, its homes and cities bought back to a livable state, and so that we are not distracted by a war that could turn from a pantomime into an even greater tragedy than it already is. I tire of this bizarre and ridiculous charade that we are apparently too stupid to stop, too uncaring to prevent. It needs to end, and end today, yesterday, TEN DAMNED YEARS AGO OR MORE! Can we stop accepting the lies, the obfuscations, the programming we have been fed? Can we PLEASE start doing that as a group? Would that be too damned much to ask? Because to be quite frank, if we cannot even do that, then we deserve to burn in nuclear fire for a hundred years, because we are not going to do ourselves any favours continuing such a pathetic existence as our leaders have created for us, cattle like and willing to believe whatever we are told, except that the sound of the bolt gun ahead is anything to worry about. edit on 27-10-2016 by TrueBrit because: grammatical error correction.\\'\\n \\'\\\\nIn a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98NEW PROBEâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look.

Out of Creamerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times.

The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level.

Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, who was killed at a hostel in Queensland in August, did not die as a result of terrorism, police have said. Despite this, her death was included on a list of 78 alleged \"terror\" attacks released by the Trump administration. Rosie Ayliffe said Mia\\\\\\'s death must not be used to persecute innocent people. How the BBC covered Trump\\\\\\'s list of \\\\\\'under-reported\\\\\\' terror attacks The White House released the list of attacks to back up Mr Trump\\\\\\'s claim the media was \"under-reporting\" attacks committed or inspired by the Islamic State group. The list included the Bataclan theatre attack in Paris, the shootings in Sousse, Tunisia, which killed 30 British tourists, and Ms Ayliffe-Chung\\\\\\'s murder. The 20 year old, from Wirksworth, died from multiple stab wounds, during the attack at Home Hill, near Townsville. Australian police have ruled out the possibility her death - which was widely reported by media in the UK and abroad - was the result of a terror attack. Mr Trump\\\\\\'s comments come amid a legal bid by his administration to restore a travel ban on visitors and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. In an open letter to the president, Mrs Ayliffe said: \"Treating immigrants as disposable commodities and disregarding their safety causes deaths throughout our so-called civilised world.\" French national Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with the murder of Ms Ayliffe-Chung and that of Thomas Jackson, 30, from Cheshire, who was also stabbed and later died in hospital. Mrs Ayliffe added: \"The possibility of Mia and Tom\\\\\\'s deaths being consequent to an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation. \"This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred.\" Mr Trump has insisted \"the threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real\" and has vowed to have the travel ban reinstated.\\'\\n \\'By Tom Luongo The Federal Reserveâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Open Market Committee chose not to raise interest rates six days out from an election.

He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdeportation forcesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. \\\\nAccording to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitorâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. \\\\nSo, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nWell, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a modeling agency. Also, thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitorâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melaniaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . \\\\nThe long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cother.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time. \\\\nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!

Maria Mills, 51, was originally awarded ?1,100 a month from 50-year-old Graham Mills after 13 years of marriage. Appeal Court judges also ruled he should pay her ?1,441 per month as she is \"unable to meet her basic needs\". Mr Mills had argued he should not have to \"pick up the tab\" 15 years after the couple split. Lord Justice Longmore and Sir Ernest Ryder heard the couple married in 1988, had a now-grown-up son, separated in 2001 and divorced in 2002. Mr Mills, a surveyor, had agreed to give Mrs Mills, a former Notting Hill estate agent, almost all their \"liquid capital\" when they divorced, while he kept his business. His barrister, Philip Cayford, told the court Mr Mills, who now lives in Guildford, had since remarried and wanted to \"move on\" with his life. The court heard Mrs Mills had made some \"unwise\" property investments, moving from a house in Weybridge to a flat in Wimbledon, and then to an apartment in a luxury Victorian mansion block in Battersea. After selling the Battersea flat she was left \"without any of the capital\", the court was told, and was now living in a rented home in Weybridge. Mrs Mills works for two days per week as a beauty therapist, the court was told. Frank Feehan, representing Mrs Mills, said she had been left with the responsibility for the couple\\\\\\'s young child and without enough money to buy a house that she considered \"good enough\". He said his client was \"unable to meet her basic needs\". In the ruling, Sir Ernest said Mr Mills had the ability to make the increased maintenance \"until a further order of the court\".\\'\\n \\'By Amanda Froelich By 2050, the worldâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s population is estimated to reach 9.7 billion people.

Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star â\\\\x80\\\\x98s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . \\\\nThere are literally hundreds of lies in Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s speeches. Theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. \\\\nIs there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, sheâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. \\\\nThe Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintonsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s record, The campaign, Russia, Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s health and Government corruption. \\\\nThey also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe electoral system is rigged.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Of course, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s rigged against him: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. â\\\\x80\\\\x98Riggedâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 became his catchword. \\\\nHe claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired â\\\\x80\\\\x98thugsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis â\\\\x80\\\\x94 cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. \\\\nIn Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nNobodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. \\\\nAnother is, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cMuslims are risky.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis claims that Syrian refugees â\\\\x80\\\\x94 99 per cent are Muslim â\\\\x80\\\\x94 are terrorists plays to the fears of the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cother,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s claims â\\\\x80\\\\x94 about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe polls favour Trump.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Har de har har â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This â\\\\x80\\\\x98poll denialismâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. \\\\nHis false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. \\\\nOn Oct. 24, he said â\\\\x80\\\\x98I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. \\\\nOf course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and exaggerate â\\\\x80\\\\x94 those numbers.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nBut these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe failing NYTimes reporters donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy â\\\\x80\\\\x98open borders,â\\\\x80\\\\x99 [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHillaryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s plan includes an open border with the Middle East.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, â\\\\x80\\\\x9ca Democrat.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran â\\\\x80\\\\x9c$150 billionâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many peopleâ\\\\x80¦Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely asserted that Clinton has â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO â\\\\x80\\\\x9cobsolete because it doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t cover terror;â\\\\x80\\\\x9d falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him â\\\\x80\\\\x9chave been largely debunked.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did not. I did notâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d to Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s charge that he thinks Climate change is a â\\\\x80\\\\x9choax perpetrated by the Chinese.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was against going into Iraq. And itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s so well-documented.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Falsely said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAnd so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paperâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s lying, and continue to sell the myth that heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies. \\\\nTo see the full list and detailed analysis, click here . \\\\nFeatured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images Share this Article!

Well, she slipped and fell, so I helped her up and we made our way back to the bridge to go across the sane way, when we saw a sleeve stapled to the outside of the wooden handrail with a DVD in it labeled simply with \"infowars.com Jesse Ventura 9/11\", and I grabbed it because... well, why not? Popped it in at her house and watched it, it was an episode or two from Jesse Ventura\\\\\\'s show Conspiracy Theory, one about FEMA camps, one about 9/11, and then some reletively short clip of Alex Jones yelling at me, and ending with an audio clip of some guy preaching about the end times coming soon and needing to get right with Jesus or something.

Last week, after Iran tested a ballistic missile, Trump tweeted that the country was \"playing with fire,\" saying they \"don\\\\\\'t appreciate how \\\\\\'kind\\\\\\' President (Barack) Obama was to them. Not me!\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who makes the final decisions on all major policies in Iran, appeared to respond to the tweet in a remarks carried by State TV. \"Why should we be thankful to the previous U.S. administration?\" he said. \"Because it imposed anti-Iranian sanctions? Because of the extremist Islamic State group? Setting the region on fire in Iraq and Syria?\" He went on to mock Trump, saying: \"We are thankful to Mr. Newcomer, of course, since he has shown the real face of the U.S. and proved what Iran has said for 38 years about the political, economic, social and moral corruption of the U.S. government.\" He added that the Iranian people \"are not afraid of any threat.\" Trump has repeatedly criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers, in which Tehran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions, but he has not said what he plans to do about it. His administration said Iran was \"on notice\" over the missile test, and imposed new sanctions on more than two dozen Iranian companies and individuals. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who has worked to improve relations with the West, said earlier Tuesday that the nuclear agreement could serve as a blueprint for resolving other Middle East disputes. As an example, he pointed to Russian-led negotiations in Kazakhstan aimed at firming up a shaky Syrian cease-fire and paving the way for the revival of peace talks to end that country\\\\\\'s nearly six-year civil war. Iran and Russia are close allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad, while the U.S. and other Western countries support the rebels fighting to topple him.\\'\\n \\'Tax is set to rise as a share of the UK\\\\\\'s income to its highest level since 1986, according to a think tank. Higher income from taxes and relatively low growth will combine to create this effect, according to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Austerity will continue into the 2020s, after Chancellor Philip Hammond\\\\\\'s decision to scrap a target of balancing the nation\\\\\\'s books, it said. The Treasury said it was committed to repairing Britain\\\\\\'s finances. Forecasts by Oxford Economics, which contributed to the report, estimate the UK economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017. In 2018, growth in gross domestic product will slow to 1.3%, Oxford Economics said. Growth is expected to be dulled as a result of inflation prompted by the decline of the value of the pound after the EU referendum. While a weaker pound is likely to improve the performance of manufacturers and exporters, higher costs for consumers will more than erase this gain, said the report. Ahmed: Public finances and the shadow of Osborne \"Though the UK economy has continued to achieve solid growth, it has been almost entirely reliant on the consumer,\" said Andrew Goodwin, lead UK Economist at Oxford Economics and co-author of part of the report. \"With spending power set to come under significant pressure from higher inflation and the welfare squeeze, the consumer will not be able to keep contributing more than its fair share. Exports should be a bright spot, but overall a slowdown in GDP growth appears likely.\" The UK\\\\\\'s economy could be 3% smaller by 2030 than if Britain had voted Remain, according to forecasts in the IFS\\\\\\'s annual Green Budget. This annual analysis, ahead of next month\\\\\\'s Budget, says spending on health, social care and benefits for sick or disabled people represents a particular risk to the public finances because it accounts for almost one third of government expenditure. The report confirms that the period between 2009 and 2014 saw the slowest rate of growth in health spending in England since the mid-1950s. And it argues that health budgets by the end of this decade will be over a billion pounds less than what is needed to cope with England\\\\\\'s growing and ageing population, regardless of what are likely to be significant rises in demand for NHS care. In a statement, the Treasury said: \"The government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all. \"That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers\\\\\\' money.\" Spending on public services dropped by 10% since 2010, the report said, after adjusting the figures for inflation. To meet his target of eliminating the deficit during the next parliament, which is from 2020 to 2025, Mr Hammond will probably have to find a further ?34bn in tax rises and spending cuts, extending austerity. The report said ?17bn of tax rises could be needed to contribute to closing the gap for government between outgoings and income.\\'\\n \\'By Isaac Davis How is the government going to get people to pay their taxes if the government is not viewed as legitimate? ~ Catherine... \\'\\n \"I didn\\'t know which one to do first or rather if I would but I did and not in chronological order either.

Juan Jasso was verbally attacked and had beer thrown at him for tackling the trio for using foul language on the Metrolink tram on 28 June. Jobless Robert Molloy, 20, of no fixed address, was jailed for six months for abusing Mr Jasso and two other men. Sentencing of Aaron Cauchi, 19, was adjourned over illness while a boy, 16, was given a six-month referral order. The court heard the trio had been drinking all night when they went on a \"rampage\" and abused Mr Jasso and two other people in separate incidents. Their abuse of Mr Jasso was filmed by a passenger and widely viewed. Trouble began at 07:45 BST when a passenger heard \"disgusting, vile abuse\" on the tram packed with mothers with babies, schoolchildren and commuters, the court heard. Joseph O\\\\\\'Connor, prosecuting, told the court the trio then got off the tram and surrounded another man, \"with their chests stuck out and shoulders back, striking him with a cigarette lighter to intimidate him\". Shortly afterwards another man was cycling to work when he passed the trio and one or more spat at him, the court heard. Molloy pleaded guilty to racially aggravated assault, common assault and using threatening words or behaviour. Jailing Molloy, chair of the bench Michael Evans told him: \"Hopefully on your release from prison a lesson will be learned and you will be able to make a positive contribution and treat people with respect.\" Molloy was also banned from using Greater Manchester trams for two years. Cauchi, of Spa Crescent, Little Hulton, Salford, who admitted to using threatening words or behaviour to Mr Jasso and another man and an assault on a third man, was taken from the court in an ambulance to hospital after complaining of stomach pains. It is not known when he will be sentenced. The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, received a six-month referral on Monday. He was charged with using threatening words or behaviour and common assault.\\'\\n \\'11 Shares\\\\n10 0 0 1\\\\nI grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views Vietnamese Americans as the targets of war. I\\\\\\'ve lived through successive Democratic Party administrations with little to celebrate. The Bill Clinton era brought NAFTA, which outsourced my Aunt\\\\\\'s union job and forced her into the low-wage service sector. My mother never found a living wage job and relied on my father\\\\\\'s public sector union position to meet our family\\\\\\'s needs. In the 21st century, Obama expanded Bushâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s War on Terror, which merged my fatherâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s job with into the Department of Homeland Security.\\\\nDownward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and I. Even then, my sister and I graduated with large sums of student debt. I have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage. Another four years of a Democratic Party President was not going to make anything better for my family. That is not to say that Donald Trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation. But Trump\\\\\\'s victory is not the end of the world, either.\\\\nTrump\\\\\\'s victory is the product of global capitalismâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s decay. Millions of people voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them. I donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t agree with all of his solutions. White nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda. Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s call to further militarize the US-Mexico border yet make peace with Russia is a contradiction in and of itself. A white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency.\\\\nHowever, Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s consistency is not the most important aspect of this election. Millions of people have shown their disgust with the two-party system of the capitalist class. A number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for Trump. Trump also received more votes than expected from the Black and Latino electorate. Meanwhile, the elections produced a low turnout for Clinton from the historic Democratic Party bases of Black voters, Latino voters, and women voters. Clinton may have won the electoral vote, but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on Trump. Trump\\\\\\'s base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of Democratic party voters who are now without a home. The round table of elites called the Electoral College could not afford any more damage to the Democratic Party than what transpired during the election.\\\\nSo the Democratic Party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it: white liberals. A large section of the Democratic Party base wanted Bernie Sanders to be their next President. They did not hold their nose for Clinton. The legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with Trump\\\\\\'s racism should not be led into the bowels of the Democratic Party. Yet for white liberals, this is the ultimate mission.\\\\nMORE... Brian Cloughley: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and Chinaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Arise President Trump (or Why it\\\\\\'s not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump\\\\\\'s sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP\\\\\\'s attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump\\\\\\'s victory has energized the white liberal section of the United States to fight back. White liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over Clinton\\\\\\'s loss. They then placed blame for Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory on Russia, low-voter turnout, and the white working class. White liberals have blamed everyone except Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Now, white liberals in the US hope to wage a crusade against Trump in hopes of a Democratic Party recovery. It is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both Trump and Clinton and lead them into the Democratic Party graveyard.\\\\nWhite liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal. They speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other. They talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests. White liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from.\\\\nWhite liberals usually originate from the ruling class, the managerial class, and various stripes of the professionalized sector. Their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of \"human rights\" based on race, gender, and sexual equality. However, White liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation. In other words, the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in US society. It has wielded the so-called struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of class-consciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders.\\\\nThe 2016 elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame. White liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the Trump moment. Their dominance over the left in the US ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline. Millions of people voted for Sanders based on his demands for material relief. Millions of people voted for Trump for the similar reasons, his racism and sexism notwithstanding. Whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not \"trump\" the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him. If the Trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily, they would of voted for Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush in the primaries.\\\\nSo White liberal anger about Trump\\\\\\'s victory is not directed at sexism, racism, or any other aspect of Trump\\\\\\'s politics. White liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of US society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order. Millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years? Where were the White liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by Democratic Party Administrations? Where were the White liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world, the institutions that murder and incarcerate Black Americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates?\\\\nThe answer is that white liberals were supporting the US capitalist system\\\\\\'s assault on the oppressed every step of the way. This is what they are trying to hide with their anger over Trump. We cannot defeat Trump\\\\\\'s white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor. White liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements. As it spreads, it breeds the germs of Democratic Party control over these movements. But the Democratic Party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class. If a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of Trump, then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the Democratic Party and build an independent party of our own.\\'\\n \\'By Jay Syrmopoulos Pipeline opponents attempting to protect their water supply from the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), as well as prevent the continued destruction... \\'\\n \\'Two strippers who admitted blackmailing rugby player Danny Cipriani, after one of them aborted his child, have received suspended sentences. Lisa Murphy, 39, had a termination in the summer of 2015 after a relationship with Cipriani, 29, the court heard. But when she was forced to miss work, due to complications, she asked him for money, which he did not pay. Murphy enlisted her colleague, Violet Smith, 29, for help and they threatened to go to the papers with the story. Murphy from Wootton, Northampton, and Smith of Slough, Berkshire, were handed a 22-month sentence suspended for two years at Kingston Crown Court. The Wasps fly-half - who was playing for Sale Sharks at the time - had offered to pay for the abortion but Murphy refused, insisting she could have the procedure for free on the NHS, the court heard previously. But when she experienced a health scare following the procedure and was unable to work, she became \"increasingly frustrated, increasingly upset, and increasingly desperate\", her lawyer, Hannah Duncan, said. Judge Peter Lodder noted while Cipriani had \"repeatedly\" offered to help, he \"did not act according to his earlier promises\". He said: \"Certainly he does not appear to have fully appreciated the extent of your difficulties\". Judge Lodder said Murphy was \"feeling increasingly desperate and was continuing to suffer from the emotional consequences of her condition\". Nigel Mitchell, representing Smith, said the pair had been offered ?18,000 for their story by The Sun but intended to resolve the situation with the former England player and continued to message him between September and October 2015. He said: \"Ms Smith\\\\\\'s intention was to try and resolve matters. Like her co-defendant, not for a second did she consider her action and behaviour was amounting to a criminal offence.\" Judge Lodder added that Smith was \"motivated by concern\" for her friend. \"It is against that background that the threat to go to the newspapers was made,\" he told the court. Describing how both defendants had since lost their jobs, he commented: \"It is an understatement to say that nobody has come out of this episode well.\" \\'\\n \\'9 Shares\\\\n8 0 0 1\\\\n[ Note: Here \"Liberalism\" (capitalized) refers to an approach to just governance based on equality and liberty.

For every human community, though, there is always an organizing principle at work.\\\\nHistory teaches us that there is a \\\\\\'default value\\\\\\' for the organizing principle of communities. That is to say, there is one organizing principle that will be used if no other one is chosen in its stead. In the absence of any other, the organizing principle of human communities will be \\\\\\'rule by the most ruthless\\\\\\'.\\\\nUnderstandably, people have sought other organizing principles. The Modern era is defined, socially, by the attempt to use some secular conception of justice as an organizing principle for society. In doing that ideology was invented.\\\\n[Karl Marx, whose work has been hugely influential in this era, denied that a principle of justice was at work in his \"scientific\" account of the \\\\\\'inevitable\\\\\\' development of human society (\"dialectical materialism\"), but his work definitely had a moral content. Otherwise, there can be nothing wrong with \"exploitation,\" even to the point of slavery. To apply any conception of morality to governance can be said to be an attempt at justice.]\\\\nEnter Locke... John Locke\\\\nThe most influential account of justice in the Modern era is that of John Locke. In Two Treatises of Government , published in 1689 in England, he made equality and liberty the basis of justice. Every Western philosopher since him has been required to endorse or refute equality and liberty.\\\\nEquality was the topic of the first of Locke\\\\\\'s treatises. Though the thrust of his philosophy was to make governance more secular and less dependent on religion (ideological as opposed to theological), for him equality came from the Bible. In that treatise of his a fundamental moral equality among men is an underlying condition that must be upheld for there to be justice in the governance of a community.\\\\n[A claim of moral equality can be purely secular, but in the England of Locke\\\\\\'s time that was no more likely than claiming equality for women was. Also, in that time and place, as among so many others, the topic of governance left women out or treated them as property.]\\\\nIn Locke\\\\\\'s second treatise he made a case for liberty as the predicate of justice. He used two accounts of liberty to make that case.\\\\nFirst, Locke asserted that liberty is a \\\\\\'Natural Right\\\\\\'. He did not invent the idea of Natural Rights. Like so many ideas in Western culture, it can be traced back to the ancient Greeks. It was also discussed by scholars of the medieval Catholic Churchâ\\\\x80\\\\x94as grants of a kind ordained by God within the \\\\\\'Natural Law\\\\\\', i.e. the law \\\\\\'written on the hearts of men\\\\\\' by the Lord.\\\\nThe idea of \\\\\\'rights\\\\\\' was already deeply ingrained in the people populating the British Iles in Locke\\\\\\'s time. Natural Rights is one formulation of the idea that there are certain Rights to which all people are entitled merely by virtue of being human (dropping the genderism). Locke said that the Natural Rights are life, liberty, and property. For people who believe in Natural Rightsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94or any other form of a priori Rightsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94for any of those Rights to be arbitrarily violated is on the face of it an injustice.\\\\nIn Locke\\\\\\'s other account of liberty as the predicate of justice he started by defining injustice as being \"subject to the arbitrary will\" of another person. Thus, freedom from the arbitrary will of any other person is justice. To be free of the arbitrary will of any other person is obviously at the same time to enjoy liberty. Locke therefore concluded with perfect logic that justice is liberty.\\\\nThe problem Locke left us\\\\nThere are all kinds of problems with liberty as the predicate of justice. On the face of it, can people running around doing whatever they want really be relied upon to result in just outcomes?\\\\nIf justice is liberty, the answer has to be that whatever results from people doing whatever they want is just. Outcomes are beside the point. To see what that would look like, as my good friend who is a doctor is fond of saying, watch any episode of the T.V. show Deadwood . For my money, that show portrays a rather benign version of a community with unconstrained liberty as its organizing principle.\\\\nFor Locke, the Natural Rights of life and property trump liberty of that kind. Everyone\\\\\\'s liberty is constrained by those Rights. Yet, liberty itself is also a Right. Bertrand Russell said that Locke was a \"successful\" philosopher because every time he saw a contradiction looming he simply changed the subject.\\\\nWhen constraints are put on liberty to achieve justice, then those constraints become the real determiners of justice. In that case, outcomes do enter into the evaluation of justice. Liberty becomes one possible \"social good\" (from John Rawls) among others.\\\\nSetting aside more philosophical complaints and the chances for violent mayhem ending in rule by the most ruthless, focusing on rights, especially Rights, begets a self-centered approach to life. It\\\\\\'s all about \\\\\\' my right\\\\\\' to do this, have that, etc.\\\\nRights are the basis of governance in the U.S. I blame that approach to governance for the incivility and the loathing to take other people into account that in my observation pervade this nation these days.\\\\nTurning to mutual respect\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t get me wrong. I love liberty. I very much doubt anyone could love it more than I do.\\\\nThere is a better way, however, to achieve liberty. That way is mutual respect. As a practical matter, mutual respect would maximize the liberty that co-existing people can enjoy simultaneously. \"Practical\" liberty is (as opposed to some idealized, hypothetical concept) \\\\\\'real liberty\\\\\\', the liberty we experience in our day-to-day lives.\\\\nAt bottom, \"respect\" in this context simply means taking other people into account. As an ethic it can operate on the personal level, in business, for the structure and overall functioning of the economy, and for the political process itself.\\\\n[Readers should note that having the economy be passively governed by mutual respect would relieve it of being actively governed, as it is at present, by government and a quasi-governmental central bank.]\\\\nMutual respect has a history in Western philosophy, too. It is present in the moral philosophies of both Immanuel Kant and G.W.F. Hegel (ranked one and two, in one order or the other, on most people\\\\\\'s lists of \\\\\\'greatest Modern philosophers\\\\\\'). It is also present in utilitarianism.\\\\nFor that matter, any philosophy that includes, explicitly or implicitly, a belief in human equality includes a presumption of mutual respect. Adopting mutual respect for governing governance does not depend on that or any other belief, but a belief in equality does bring a requirement of mutual respect with it.\\\\nBack to Locke for mutual respect\\\\nThe mutual respect implicit in a belief in equality is manifested in Locke\\\\\\'s thought as equal respect for people\\\\\\'s Natural Rights. When Locke used a dialectical argument to make liberty the predicate of justice he was standing right in front of mutual respect, but was facing the wrong way, as it were.\\\\nRecall that he defined injustice as being subject to the arbitrary of any other person. The opposite of being in that condition is justice. Since the opposite of being subject to the arbitrary will of anyone else is at the same time being at liberty, Locke surmised that justice is liberty.\\\\nOn the other hand, there is a conclusion to be reached from Locke\\\\\\'s starting point that is every bit as logical as the one Locke made. Philosophically, this conclusion beats his because it is more immediate, it raises no contradictions, and it does not result in a predicate of justice that itself must be constrained to prevent rule by the most ruthless. Practically, unlike equality per se and unconstrained liberty, taking this route to justice can efficaciously achieve just governance of both the economy and the political process while maximizing liberty.\\\\n[The most focused readers will have noticed that Locke\\\\\\'s definition of injustice must itself be substantiated, but we can leave that for another day. Besides, I\\\\\\'ve never seen it disputed except, indirectly, by Frederick Nietzsche and Ayn Rand in their hyper-romantic mode.]\\\\nHere it is: if injustice is being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person, then justice requires that everyone refrain from subjecting any other person to one\\\\\\'s own arbitrary will.\\\\nWhen people are doing that, justice is the result. No constraints on such behavior are needed.\\\\nTo refrain from arbitrarily subjecting other people to one\\\\\\'s will is to take other people into account. To take other people into account is to respect them. So, most simply the predicate of justice is mutual respect.\\\\nClosing\\\\nAs I said at the beginning of this little essay, using mutual respect to govern governance would maximize practical liberty, reinforce political democracy, and retain the definitive institutions of the market-based economy. Applying it to the economy would allow us to eliminate unemployment, poverty, taxes, and public debt while passively enhancing our chances for environmental sustainability. It would also provide a universal ethic to govern personal interactions and the conduct of business.\\\\nHow all of that follows from recognizing mutual respect as the predicate of justice is not all that difficult or complicated, but it is more than can be addressed in one essay.

No more than we could claim to be a democracy because we elected a Black president. These two elections signify nothing more than the inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite. The United States is an oligarchy of the .01%, 1% of the 1%. Any president who is not already among the .01%, like Bill Clinton, becomes part of the .01% by serving its interests and then peddling influence after leaving office. No one has developed an influence peddling machine as well-oiled as the Clintons, with Bill working the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative while Hillary was Secretary of State.

Nevertheless, only a small minority of Americans actually vote n local elections; The Atlantic\\\\\\'s CityLab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than 20% vote in mayoral elections in 15 of the 30 most populous cites.

Not Much and Here\\\\\\'s Why Clinton\\\\\\'s Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency How do you explain the dynastic governance Clinton? Is the American dream in all its glory?\\\\nIâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sure I can explain the Clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one. Chelsea has been very involved in the Clinton Foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day. We have had other political dynasties, most notably the Roosevelts, the Kennedys and the Bushes, and there are many lower level dynasties, like the Browns in California. Jerry Brown, the current governor of California, is the son of former California governor Pat Brown. New York State has the Cuomos; Governor Andrew Cuomo is the son of former Governor Mario Cuomo, and his brother Chris Cuomo is a prominent corporate television host.\\\\nRegarding the American dream, I assume you\\\\\\'re referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can achieve some proportionate degree of status, security and prosperity. If so, the Clintons certainly aren\\\\\\'t living the American dream because, although they did well in school, they\\\\\\'ve hardly played by the rules. They\\\\\\'ve enriched themselves with that well-oiled influence peddling operation I mentioned earlier, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. We\\\\\\'re all wondering whether Hillary Clinton, and maybe even Bill Clinton, might finally be indicted now that the FBI has reopened its investigation of Clinton e-mail because more of it was discovered on the laptop that Anthony Weiner - a former Congressman under FBI investigation for sex offense - shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. If Hillary Clinton is elected, she\\\\\\'ll have to be impeached, convicted and removed from office, but that\\\\\\'s extremely unlikely - no matter what\\\\\\'s in the newly discovered e-mail - if her party, the Democrats, win a majority in the House and more than a one- third minority in the Senate. It takes a majority in the House to impeach a president and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to then convict and remove a president. So Hillary Clinton is at a Berlusconi moment in her sordid career; her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected. Getting back to the American dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a 19-year-old White House intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee. However, his own party held a majority in the Senate and they acquitted him. This was all legal, according to the U.S. Constitution, but does it really sound like he was \"playing by the rules\"? During the final days of his presidency, Clinton acquitted Glencore International founder Mark Rich, an international fugitive who had fled to Switzerland. His ex-wife had donated to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s New York Senate campaign.\\\\nAccording to the law, President Clinton had the authority to acquit Rich, but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption?\\\\nIn 2006, Clinton polished the reputation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan\\\\\\'s autocratic leader and human rights offender, who then gave a uranium mining lease to Canadian businessman Frank Giustra\\\\\\'s Shell Company, making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight. Giustra then made a big contribution to the Clinton Foundation. No one has claimed that this was illegal, but is it \"playing by the rules\"?\\\\nWhen Guistra sold a majority stake in his company, Uranium One, to Rosatom, the Russian atomic energy agency, it was approved by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Giustra then contributed $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton was offered a $500,000 speaking engagement with a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin. Does that sound like playing by the rules? And now Hillary\\\\\\'s trying to make us believe that Russia\\\\\\'s meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with Russia over Syria. I don\\\\\\'t think she\\\\\\'s kidding about the confrontation, but the Clinton Foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances.\\\\nMeanwhile, most of the rest of us are not living the American dream. Sixty-three percent of Americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe, unable to handle a $500 car repair or a $1000 emergency room bill . The Clintons, as I said, serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join. When Bill Clinton was on his way out, in the last months of his presidency, he worked with Republicans in the lame duck Congress to deregulate the banking industry. By 2008, its dishonest, excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy, costing millions of Americans their jobs and/or homes. Then, as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s wake.\\\\nHow do you explain that candidate Clinton, who failed as Secretary of State with the death of the US Ambassador in Libya, her health problems, the scandal of emails, is the candidate of the Democrats?\\\\nAgain, Clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined. Many people believe that the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy, growing income inequality, and even the Israeli lobbyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s dominance in American politics.\\\\nBut thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s one other important element to this. Americans who identify as liberals, supporters of women\\\\\\'s rights, and/or anti-racists have such a longstanding allegiance to the Democratic Party that supporting its nominee every four years is their knee-jerk reaction. Ever escalating foreign wars donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience, especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of U.S. troops. And once the Republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic Donald Trump, defeating Trump became a liberal crusade.\\\\nThere are, of course, glimmers of rationality and hope. Yesterday I was out canvassing for an Oakland, California ballot measure with a young Black man, a college sophomore. Despite Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s overt racism, he told me that he considers Clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with Russia over Syria. He understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war, accidental or not, and that Trump, for all his faults, says that the Cold War is over, that NATO is largely obsolete, and that Clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with Russia by promising to remove Bashar Al-Assad.\\\\nOur Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is reported to be polling at 16% among voters under 35, and much of Bernie Sandersâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s support was quite visibly from the same age group. Local, grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control. They include community gardens, renewable energy buyers\\\\\\' co-operatives, and GMO-free zones. If a ballot initiative to make California\\\\\\'s Sonoma County GMO-free passes, the whole northwest coast of California will be a GMO-free zone, from Santa Cruz to Humboldt Counties and including one inland county, Trinity.\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t you think that the two-headed American system with the candidates of two traditional parties, Democratic and Republican is out of breath?\\\\nI wouldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t say itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s out of breath because itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s still very much in control. However, Trump has left the Republican Party in disarray, with many Republican luminaries and funders defecting to Clinton, who is welcoming them with open arms. As Black Agenda Report Editor Glen Ford has written , the Clintons â\\\\x80\\\\x9chave succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the U.S. ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons. The scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the Lords of Capital so well for so long, has come undone. Thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules, the two parties of the ruling class have become one.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nItâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard to say whether or not the Republican Party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does.\\\\nOne possibility could significantly change this. If Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein wins 5% in this election, the Green Party will become an official national party eligible for 5% of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee. This year all federal funds went to the two official national parties, Republicans and Democrats, who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money. The Greens take no corporate money.\\\\nFive percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much, but it would be a huge watershed for the U.S. Greens. It would be a big psychological and visibility boost, and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that Jill Steinâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign has been able to raise.\\\\nWinning 5% would also ensure ballot access for the Greens in most states, not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races. As it is, Greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the 50 states.\\\\nEveryone knows that Clinton is the future president of the USA. In your opinion, why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing Clinton in the Oval Office?\\\\nShe is backed by the oligarchy, corporate and dynastic, particularly the investment bankers, the oil industry, and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars. They are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them. Liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid Clinton operatives in this election, and the corporate media, like the cops, serve as protectors of the oligarchy. And again, the majority of Americans are politically disengaged.\\\\nYou are close to Jill Stein, head of the Green party, which emerged late in the campaign. Why was this alternative sabotaged?\\\\nWell, I wouldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t say Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m close to Jill personally, but she knows who I am and I, of course, know who she is. Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve reported on her campaign and on the U.S. Greens for the past year, on radio and in print and online outlets, and Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages. I write for the Black Agenda Report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors, who have given their full support to the Green Party this year, even as Bernie Sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the Democratic nomination. In these times that are so easy to see as the end times, shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have, regardless of the geographic distance between us.\\\\nJillâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign could hardly compete with the Republicans\\\\\\' and Democrats\\\\\\' because neither she nor any other Greens solicit or accept corporate money. We stand behind the slogan, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeople and Planet before Profits.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d And we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers, fossil fuel giants, and agro-chemical companies who profit from it. Jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half, closing all the U.S. military bases in foreign countries and launching a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpeace offensive.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d She proposes free public education from kindergarten through college, the abolition of student debt, national health insurance and a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreen New Dealâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal, immoral, lethal and environmentally catastrophic U.S. wars. The Green New Deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s too late to stop the climate meltdown - if it isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t too late already. And it would fully employ Americans in meaningful, dignified and cooperative work for the common good.\\\\nOf course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the death-march industries. I would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka from winning the 5% that would make us an official national party.\\\\nI have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop Greens at the local level. In 2003, Matt Gonzalez, the Green Party\\\\\\'s mayoral candidate in San Francisco, seemed to have a good chance of winning. That so alarmed the Democratic Party that it sent all its best known, most powerful names and faces to San Francisco to campaign for the Democratic candidate. They sent Hillary and Bill. They sent Jesse Jackson. They sent many Democratic Party superstars more than once. They seemed to be more concerned about defeating Matt Gonzalez and the Greens in San Francisco than they were about defeating George Bush and the Republicans in the following yearâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s presidential election.\\\\nOne of the founders of the San Francisco Green Party was elected to the City and County Board of Supervisors twice, but when he ran for Sheriff, an executive office, Democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the Greens and joined the Democratic Party, which he did. They still got rid of him after his first term, with a really ugly campaign, but thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s another complicated story in itself. The City and County of San Francisco once had more elected Greens than any city or county in the country, but many of those that Greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the Democratic Party for the sake of their political careers.\\\\nIs not Hillary Clinton a danger for humanity?\\\\nHell yes. I agree with Congolese author and political activist Patrick Mbeko, who said sheâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s more dangerous than ISIS, for all the reasons Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already mentioned. Her dark alliance with the death-march industries, and her seeming eagerness to confront Russia over Syria and/or on Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s borders in the interest of global hegemony. Russian uranium deal aside, I think that Diana Johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cher strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in Russia.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd I have to mention my friends from the African Great Lakes Region - particularly Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo - which became the killing grounds of the 1990s, as the U.S., using African proxies, established itself as the dominant power there. Most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the Clintonsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 all but certain return to the White House. The Clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the Rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the First and Second Congo Wars and later the â\\\\x80\\\\x9chumanitarianâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d interventions in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. If the truth about Rwanda and DR Congo were known, Bill Clinton would be implicated in mass murder, but that\\\\\\'s true of every U.S. president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that. No one\\\\\\'s going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority.\\\\nYou have many worked on Africa. How do you explain the French leadership in Africa?\\\\nWell, Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m no expert in this, but I can say a few things.\\\\nFirst, I wouldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t call it leadership. Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99d say that France sustains a neocolonial and military presence in Africa. France was a partner in the destruction of Libya. In Mali, Niger, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, France is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates 75% of its electricity. Thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s no doubt that France was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister President Thomas Sankara and the installation of President Blaise CompaorÃ© in Burkina Faso. I donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t see any sign that French policy towards Burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now, despite its resignation to CompaorÃ©â\\\\x80\\\\x99s ouster by a popular movement.\\\\nFrance and the U.S. now appear to be military partners in Africa more often than not, but during the Rwandan war and massacres and the Congo Wars of the 1990s, the U.S. displaced France as the dominant power there.\\\\nHowever, a source of ongoing tension between France and the U.S. has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the Rwandan Genocide. The U.S. defends Rwandan President Paul Kagameâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s account, in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage. Kagame blames France, particularly for Operation Turquoise, in which French troops created a humanitarian corridor for Rwandan refugees, mostly Hutus, who were fleeing the advance of Kagameâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Rwandan Patriotic Army. This conflict has recently been renewed, first with France reopening its investigation of allegations that Kagame ordered the assassination of Rwanda and Burundiâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hutu presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, in 1994. Rwanda responded by accusing 22 French officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in Rwanda.\\\\nIn 2010, Nicholas Sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between France and the U.S. and Rwanda by accepting the U.S./Rwandan account of the massacres. He publicly apologized for Franceâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s alleged guilt in Rwandaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s tragedy , and shortly thereafter, France was rewarded with greater access to DR Congo\\\\\\'s resource riches. However, Alain JuppÃ©, who was the French prime minister at the time of the Rwandan massacres and Operation Turquoise, was having none of that. He even left the country during Kagameâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s 2011 \"reconciliaton\" visit to Paris . Now JuppÃ© seems to be leading Sarkozy in the bid for his partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nomination, and if he is elected president, the history of Rwanda and DR Congo in the 1990s will be more fiercely contested. Most of my Rwandan friends very much hope that JuppÃ© will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened. They believe, for one, that Operation Turquoise saved many Rwandan lives.\\\\nWhile Africa is a young continent, How do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who don\\\\\\'t want lose the power?\\\\nThe old presidents cling to power, and the Western powers with geo-strategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people. Rwandaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Kagame and Ugandaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the U.S. and other Western interests.\\\\nFrance, the U.S., and all the rest of the NATO nations appear to be united in their determination to topple Burundiâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Nkurunziza, who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the East, particularly Russia, in resource extraction contracts. I can\\\\\\'t explain Mugabe\\\\\\'s hold on power at age 92 or Omar al-Bashir\\\\\\'s at 72, since neither are U.S. aliies. You\\\\\\'ll have to ask Africans in those countries to explain that.\\\\nIn your opinion, is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of Africa? Why doesn\\\\\\'t Africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model?\\\\nI really hesitate to say anything about that because Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m not African myself and I think Western media often use the word â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80\\\\x98tribeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d as a racial slur that disguises Western resource interests at play in African conflicts. I recently wrote a piece about the new film A Brilliant Genocide , and Milton Allimadi, the Ugandan-born editor of the Black Star News, told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99d used the word â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctribe.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d I told him I\\\\\\'d been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it. Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m now reading his book, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Hearts of Darkness: How White Writers Created the Racist Image of Africa .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhy are Congolese being massacred in Beni Territory, North Kivu Province ? The first question I\\\\\\'ve asked to try to answer that question is, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat resources are there?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d In Beni, the answer is oil, timber, gold, diamonds, wolfram, coltan and cassiterite. Beni is a vivid example of the saying, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cEverybody wants a piece of Congo.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d No one could convince me that the industrial nationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts. Why are all the deadly â\\\\x80\\\\x9cethnicâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d conflicts in DR Congoâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s resource-rich eastern provinces?\\\\nThe competition and/or animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real, as they are in the West, but in Africa, the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes. Western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests.\\\\nI sometimes co-host a show called AfrobeatRadio with my friend Wuyi Jacobs on WBAI-New York City, and we both hope to someday produce a show about Rwanda and Burundi in which we wonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to use the words â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHutuâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d or â\\\\x80\\\\x9cTutsi.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dr. LÃ©opold Munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in Rwandan history that were exaggerated by Europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other.\\\\nLibya lives total chaos. How do you analyze the situation in Libya?\\\\nItâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s horrible. Like so much else, it makes me deeply ashamed to be an American. If you read Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s e-mail, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy to see that the U.S.]/NATO war on Libya was, for one, another Western war against another defiant resource nationalist, Muammar Gaddafi. Regardless of whatever human rights offenses Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein were guilty of, both were resource nationalists, as was Mohammed Mossadegh, the secular, democratically elected prime minister of Iran who nationalized Iranian oil before our CIA and the UK\\\\\\'s M16 ousted him in the 1953 coup. I wrote about how this played out in Libya in â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Clinton E-MaIl: We came, we saw, we got oil .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nObama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the Libyan War was the greatest mistake of his presidency, but I\\\\\\'d say his greatest mistake was waging the Libyan War in the first place.

(AP Photo / Dennis System) \\\\nCOLUMBUS, OH (AP) â\\\\x80\\\\x94 History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. \\\\nThe organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. \\\\nThe Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said AAB chairman Menno Simons. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lordâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s way.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAccording to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Silver noted. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cI donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Clinton wrote to the AAB. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nMost pundits believe that Mrs. Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s plea is too little too late. \\\\nDuring a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Amish do great work for a very low price.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThough Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s really sad to see the campaign end this way.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Amish community and the AAB, you can contact the Pennsylvania Amish Heritage Museum at (785) 273-0325.

Donald Trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment, while Hillary Clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for President in the history of the country.\\\\nA President Clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards India that we saw in the 1990s overseen by her husband. After he took office in 1993 the US relationship with India went on a considerable down-slide. For nearly a year, Clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to India even as he went about opposing India on multiple fronts, leading to anger in the Indian establishment. Initially he was intent on disarming and weakening India by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the Indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions.\\\\nIn 1991, Senator Joe Biden, who is now the Vice President under Barack Obama, introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to Russia, making the aid conditional on the fact that Russia could not sell cryogenic engines for India\\\\\\'s space programme. The Clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of India\\\\\\'s space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of Cray supercomputers that had been approved under the Ronald Reagan administration. India was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the Super 301 clause of the American trade law.\\\\nThese economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way Mr Clinton attacked the Indian textile and carpet industries. Throughout the 1990s, the terms \"Dunkel Draft\", \"Super 301\", \"WTO\" and \"patent laws\" became synonyms for the US attempts to retard the Indian economy and led to many protests in India.\\\\nBy 1996, India was justified in believing that Indo-US relations had hit the lowest point, but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during Bill Clinton\\\\\\'s second term in office. Madeleine Albright became the new Secretary of State and she was increasingly hostile to India especially through her pseudo-racist television outbursts. In fact she loved attacking India so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in Kashmir, justifying the actions of violent groups in the process.\\\\nMORE... Clinton\\\\\\'s Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Remember this is the same blood-soaked Albright who advocated bombing Yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country. Like the Clintons, she also knows how to abuse her power. Lest we forget, Albright also justified the deaths of half a million Iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were \"worth it\". And the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman? Albright has already threatened women in America and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for Hillary Clinton.\\\\nThere is already talk of Joe Biden in the frame as Secretary of State under Hillary Clinton. Biden would continue his anti-India agenda and try to thwart the development of India\\\\\\'s space programme and other technological advancements. Then of course there is Hillary\\\\\\'s closest confidante, a duplicitous lady called Huma Abedin who is of Pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Abedin could end up playing an important role in determining American foreign policy and would be certainly anti-Modi.\\\\nAnother point against Hillary Clinton is that the hawkish Henry Kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as Secretary of State. This is the same Kissinger who is so hostile against India, many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end.\\\\nIt is in the light of this setting that many Indian-Americans have opposed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and have come out in support of Donald Trump. In contrast to the policies of the Clintons, Trump has promised to make India the best friend of the US and has stated that he looks forward to working with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump has also reached out to Hindus in US. While there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if Trump can make the change he wants to, a Hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for India.\\\\nIn order for India to build a constructive relationship with US, it requires people in both countries to have good intentions. It is clear that India cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the US if Hillary Clinton is running the corridors of power. On the other hand, Donald Trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for India.\\'\\n \\'SAYA IBU SUMIATUNG DARI PAPUA SALAH SATU MEMBER MBAH SERO SAYA SEKELUARGA MENGUCAPAKAN BANYAK TERIMA KASIH KEPADA MBAH SERO ANGKA TOGEL YANG DI BERIKAN KEMARIN 4D 4970 TGL 20-OKTOBER-2016 SGP TEMBUS 100% DAN WAKTU TGL 08-OKTOBER-2016 SAYA JUGA MENANG 4D 9996 DAN PEMASANGAN PERTAMA SAYA CUMA MENANG 2D 81 TGL 01-OKTOBER-2016 KARNA SAYA COBA-COBA PASANG ANGKA DARI MBAH SERO WALAUPUN CUMA 2D NYA SYUKUR ALHAMDULILLAH SAYA MENDAPATKAN KEMENANGAN RP.700.JUTA DALAM 3X PUTARAN SAYA SUDAH BISA MELUNASI HUTANG2 SAYA YANG ADA DI BANK DAN RENCANA MAU BUKA USAHA INI SEMUA BERKAT BANTUAN MBAH SERO SAYA TIDAK AKAN MELUPAKAN BUDI BAIK MBAH BAGI SAUDARAH2 BUTUH ANGK JITU HASIL RITUA 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D KALAU MAU MENANG SEPERTI SAYA LANSUNG HUBUNGI MBAH SERO DI NOMOR HP: 082-370-357-999 ANGKA YANG DI BERIKAN MBAH SERO TIDAK PERLU DI RAGUKAN LAGI SAYA JAMIN 100% TEMBUS SOALNYA SAYA SUDAH PERNAH MEMBUKTIKANNYA 3X PUTARAN MENANG..\\'\\n \\'Print Hillary goes absolutely berserk!

But we finally got there.\" Bizarrely, the bosses of both sides said exactly the same thing to me when I interviewed them last week, moments after they\\\\\\'d announced a deal to resolve the worst of the Southern rail strikes. Mick Whelan from Aslef and Nick Brown from GTR (Southern\\\\\\'s parent company) looked shattered but pleased with their agreement. But was everyone cracking the champagne corks too soon? Aslef\\\\\\'s 1,000 or so drivers still need to vote on the deal and there are possible signs that they might just kick it out. I spoke to a couple of Southern\\\\\\'s train drivers over the weekend and they were not happy. One wrote this to me: \"GTR, \\\\\\'We will agree to carry on doing exactly what we want.\\\\\\' Aslef, \\\\\\'OK, we\\\\\\'ll agree to that then.\\\\\\'\" He went on: \"I\\\\\\'m very much of the opinion it will be a resounding \\\\\\'no\\\\\\' vote (when members vote). The feeling is the union has sold us out.\" Another driver also said that everyone he\\\\\\'d spoken to will vote no to the deal, again saying that they felt let down and that the company had got away with it. He even suggested that some of his colleagues might leave Aslef and join the RMT union instead. The RMT is still in dispute with Southern over the same issue and was vitriolic about the deal over the weekend. True, this is just the opinion of two drivers who\\\\\\'ve been chatting to their colleagues. But it suggests some anger at what they are being asked to sign up to. I understand that there is going to be a meeting in Brighton on Tuesday, where Aslef reps will try to sell the deal to members. It\\\\\\'s bound to be frosty. All of this doesn\\\\\\'t necessarily mean that Aslef\\\\\\'s drivers will vote against the agreement. When I interviewed Mick Whelan last week he told me: \"I\\\\\\'m not in the habit of making deals that my members don\\\\\\'t like.\" Then there are the London members who already use driver-only-operated trains and may not feel as strongly over this crunch issue. Plus, Aslef doesn\\\\\\'t pay members during industrial action, and the double whammy of losing strike-day pay plus overtime may be enough to cut their appetite for a fight. If the drivers do vote against the deal though, it\\\\\\'s hard to see where the next breakthrough in this dispute might come. If two weeks of \"incredibly intense\" negotiation at the TUC can\\\\\\'t solve it, what can? Presumably, Aslef would be forced to call more crippling strikes, which would also turn up the heat on the government to take over either part or all of this troublesome, complex behemoth of a franchise. I can tell you, ministers are not keen to seize control. Meanwhile, the RMT union, which represents the guards/conductors, has vowed to keep fighting. Their strikes don\\\\\\'t have the same impact as Aslef\\\\\\'s, with the last one only knocking out around 30% of services. But even that might change if their angry Aslef colleagues decide not to cross picket lines. Anyway, we should know all on 16 February when the ballot result comes back. The worst may not be over for beleaguered Southern passengers.\\'\\n \"ERB Trump vs Clinton is finally here! page: 1 link If you\\'re an avid ERB fan like me and 75% of the Internet, then you\\'ll be very happy to know that Nice Peter and Epic Lloyd have finally delivered the highly anticipated Trump vs Clinton rap battle!

First, he used a prehistoric technology: he lit a wood fire. But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hi-tech equipment with him - a Minolta light meter. He burned 20lb (9kg) of wood, kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim, flickering firelight with his meter. Next, he bought a Roman oil lamp, fitted it with a wick, and filled it with cold-pressed sesame oil. He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down, again using the light meter to measure its soft, even glow. Bill Nordhaus\\\\\\'s open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood. But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day, and more brightly and controllably. Why did he do this? He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb. But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists: how to keep track of inflation, the changing cost of goods and services. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme\\\\\\'s sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. To see why this is difficult, consider the price of travelling from - say - Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola. When that journey was first made, by Portuguese explorers, it would have been an epic expedition, possibly taking months. Later, by steam ship, it would have taken a few days; then, by plane, a few hours. An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship, but once an air route has opened up, which price do you look at? Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing. But flying is a different service - faster, more convenient. If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled. It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters. He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination. Light is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours. A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns. A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that. Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days. Those 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light. That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead. Of course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals. If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up. Thousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon. Their light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive. In a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles. Six months later, he noted: \"Candles all gone.\" And those were the summer months. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the clean-burning paraffin wax candles we use today. The wealthiest could afford beeswax, but most people - even the Harvard president - used tallow candles, stinking, smoking sticks of animal fat. Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re-dipping wicks into the molten lard. It was pungent and time-consuming work. According to Prof Nordhaus\\\\\\'s research, if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles - or earning the money to buy them - that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening. Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded. Candles were made of spermaceti - the milk-hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales. American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong, white light they gave off, and the way they \"may be held in the hand, even in hot weather, without softening\", and noted that they \"last much longer\". While the new candles were pleasing, they were also pricey. George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him ?8, or well over $1,000 (?820) in today\\\\\\'s money. A few decades later, gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs. They also saved the sperm whale from extinction. But they, too, were basically an expensive hassle. They dripped, smelt and set fire to things. Then something changed. That something was the light bulb. By 1900, one of Thomas Edison\\\\\\'s carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright, continuous illumination, 100 times as bright as a candle, for the money you could earn with our 60-hour week of hard labour. By 1920, that same week of labour would pay for more than five months\\\\\\' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs. By 1990, it was 10 years. A couple of years after that, thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs, it was more than five times longer. The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years. And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper. Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create. It would have taken Benjamin Franklin\\\\\\'s contemporaries all afternoon. But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second. And of course our light bulbs are clean, safe and controllable - no flicker, pig fat stink or risk of fire. The light bulb has become an icon of innovation. It has transformed our society into one where we can work, read, sew or play whenever we want to, regardless of how dark the night has become. But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500,000, far faster than official inflation statistics suggest. A thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice.

Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Brian Cloughley: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and Chinaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Arise President Trump (or Why it\\\\\\'s not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump\\\\\\'s sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired On a positive note, Trump has backed off on his threat to dismantle Obamacare. One thing is certain, Donald Trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day. Unfortunately, Trump did this when initially exposing the connection between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and ISIS.\\\\nIt is an absolute fact that the United States was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the Middle East, in Syria and Libya. Both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of Israel, as a Wikileaks cable recently confirmed. The mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how Obama and Clinton operate. It also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the US has been manipulated by the Zionist government of Israel, a nation that drains US taxpayers of more than $4 million a day. The track record of human rights violations in Israel goes well beyond unforgivable.\\\\nThe ISIS expose was a golden moment for Trump, even though he didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t stick to his guns. The wars the US has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like Halliburton and mercenary organizations. While the US government spends trillions on killing, it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens. One great example is Saudi Arabia, the radical Wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international law.These problems have sullied US support for many years.\\\\nThe only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation. For Clinton, maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task. Lest we forget it was her threats of war toward Russia and Iran that crossed the line for large numbers of Americans. Parading as a liberal, Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s warmongering is legendary. The Democratic National Committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate, Bernie Sanders, was equally reprehensible.\\\\nIn the end, there were no good choices for US voters. The pro-Trump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that Mr. Trump does not care about them in any way, shape or form. Only days after the election, it is already being announced that the tax cuts Trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed, it is reminiscent of former US President George Bush\\\\\\'s famous words, \"Read my lips: no new taxes\". Of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick, each time it was enough to convince Republicans. Trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals. Perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters, perhaps not.\\\\nIn the meanwhile tempers are flaring, and Americans are increasingly turning against each other. The real unavoidable truth is that Donald Trump will be the next US President. He says he is going to make America great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means. In the post-WWII years there was peace, unless you were Black. Americans had freedom, unless they were women or minorities.\\\\nThe United States has always waged illegal wars, dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with Native people after another, was broken. Is Donald Trump going to keep the US out of wars for the next four years? It would be a very good thing if he did.\\\\nOn one hand, it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of Donald Trump, but giving up is not the answer. If Trump goes too far out of sync, or becomes embroiled in charges that he can\\\\\\'t pay off or threaten away, there is an impeachment process that Americans can follow.\\'\\n \\'The claim: The green belt is safe from an increase in development. Reality Check verdict: The rules for developing green belt previously said that it was allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent. A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land. Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered. This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful. In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.\" So what has changed? There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year. The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only \"in exceptional circumstances\" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so.

Sorry, maybe a stress reaction, not to be judgmental, happens to the best and such, just really not what I am trying to convey here. Though I believe you are quite intelligent, I don\\\\\\'t think you are qualified, exactly, to make that wholesale, definitive judgement. You even contradict that by referencing Dr. Vinod\\\\\\'s \"channeling\" of the Nine in 1952. Channeling, by definition, (from Dictionary.com) means in one sense: the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide. Surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing. I don\\\\\\'t wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because I don\\\\\\'t sense this is really what your thread is about.

Kucinich introduced in the American Congress a bill, obliging the American president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons. In this bill the definition of a weapon system includes: any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on, or damaging or destroying, a person (or the biological life, bodily health, mental health, or physical and economic well-being of a person) through the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations\" (12). As in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound, light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain. Psychotronic weapons remain, at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research, in the sphere of science fiction, since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication. That it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal, either sound or visual, messages is now generally known. This is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies, without consent of the user, is banned. Devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life. As for the sound, a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves, which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted, appeared last year in the world newspapers. The beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head. Such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill. The acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging. One of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy. Though in the open scientific literature only some 30 experiments were published, supporting this assumption (1),(2), already in 1974, in the USSR, after successful testing with military unit in Novosibirsk, the installation Radioson (Radiosleep) was registered with the Government Committee on the Matters of Inventions and Discoveries of the USSR, described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves (3), (4), (5)â\\\\x80¦ 22. Dear Senator-Attorney Letter included: We seek your officeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistance in initiating hearings and a fact-finding congressional inquiry into the government agencies and/or private companies that are targeting citizens. Many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing, intrusive and oppressive targeting. Evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals, based on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filings, public releases by agencies, and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication. The weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism, microwaves, sonic waves, lasers and other types of directed energy, and were characterized as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpsychotronicâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d in Rep. Dennis Kucinichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s draft of House Resolution 2977, the Space Preservation Act of 2001. Furthermore, it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past; for example, the CIAâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s human experimentation discussed in Orlikow v. U.S., 682 F.Supp. 77 (D.D.C. 1988), secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987), and military chemical experimentation as discussed in Congressional Committee Report 103-97, 103d Congress, 2d Session, S. Prt. 103-97 (Dec. 8, 1994). Lastly, the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted, including people with post-graduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements, and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia. there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial, however, common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports, surveillance scenarios, harassment techniques, and more can be readily established. I highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit, containing a great deal of verifiable information. The military has admitted for some time to having, at the least, a non lethal (lol) weapon called active denial. But this rabbit hole goes much, much deeper. Having said all that, as I\\\\\\'ve said before in one of your threads, I think it wise to consider that it\\\\\\'s not just one thing or another. It\\\\\\'s many things. There could be aliens, for instance. And then there could be MILABS, leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction, rather than their being used for human experimentation, which is supposed to be against our constitution, and most certainly against our human rights. And then people can also suffer from temporal lobe, seizure like hallucinations, but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced, artificially, as well. In short, I think your rabbit hole is only making it to the gopher level regards,\\'\\n \\'By Melissa Dykes This has already been the craziest election in the history of the country, with the most overt corruption and fraud the American... \\'\\n \\'A trademark battle between Kylie Minogue and Kylie Jenner appears to have come to an end. Jenner, who first shot to fame in the US reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has been trying to trademark the name Kylie in the US. But she has been blocked by the veteran Australian pop star Minogue, best known for hits such as I Should Be So Lucky and Can\\\\\\'t Get You Out Of My Head. After a long and heated battle, the Kylies may have reached a settlement. According to papers filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in April 2015 Jenner attempted to register the mark \"KYLIE\" in the US for \"advertising services\" and \"endorsement services\". In response, Minogue\\\\\\'s team filed their opposition in February 2016, citing possible confusion and \"damage\" to Minogue\\\\\\'s branding. They noted Minogue was an \"internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist\" who already owns Kylie-related trademarks in the US in several industries, as well as the website www.kylie.com. Jenner, on the other hand, was dismissed as a \"secondary reality television personality\" who had drawn criticism for her \"photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts\" on social media. The case was suspended at least twice in 2016 for settlement negotiations. On 19 January Minogue\\\\\\'s team withdrew its opposition, which means Jenner\\\\\\'s application could proceed. This raises the possibility that they agreed to a settlement. The BBC approached both sides, but Jenner\\\\\\'s lawyers declined comment, and Minogue\\\\\\'s team did not respond. The USPTO does not comment on individual cases. But meanwhile Jenner appears to have conclusively lost another battle - to trademark her full name. In November 2015, Jenner\\\\\\'s lawyers separately tried to trademark the name \"KYLIE JENNER\" for a long list of clothing and accessories. But this was rejected in July last year. On 23 January, Jenner\\\\\\'s team appealed against this decision. Flight attendant shares story of saving trafficking victim Why do Germans hate this football club? How to own a home in the UK by the age of 25 Last year, Jenner launched a line of cosmetics called KYLIE. According to her latest appeal, she wants to eventually have \"KYLIE JENNER\" branded clothing as well as loungewear, swimwear, and underwear. Meanwhile, Minogue owns \"KYLIE\" and other similar trademarks in perfumes and toiletries, music and sound recordings, live entertainment, jewellery, dolls and toys, and printed matter such as magazines and books. So far, Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them. She also had previously said in interviews she intends to one day produce a musical featuring her greatest hits, and owns the US trademark for \"Lucky: The Kylie Minogue Musical\". But it\\\\\\'s more than that. Since the 1980s, Kylie Minogue has never had to go by any other name but Kylie, and her team has argued it\\\\\\'s a fundamental part of the pop diva\\\\\\'s identity. Even with a possible settlement, what the battle shows is that at the very least brand KYLIE is not won without a fight.

Credit: Gage Skidmore / flickr)\\\\nTrump\\\\\\'s victory was a shock to most, especially given the broad support Hillary Clinton received from the forces of Wall Street. Although Trump is a billionaire himself, his criticism of free trade agreements and US policy toward Russia angered a broad section of the ruling class. It is the ruling class in control of the banks, military institutions, and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the United States. Trump\\\\\\'s victory is a product of the ruling system\\\\\\'s decline and crisis more than anything else. The question is, now what?\\\\nWhat is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the Trump moment. First, Trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis. The laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite. Technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the US, creating the deindustrialized terrain Trump spoke so much about in his campaign. At the end of the day, the profits that Wall Street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades .\\\\nSo when Hillary Clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism, few listened. Many people in the US saw Clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground. The Black Lives Matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the Black prisoner population during her husband\\\\\\'s rule. Hillary Clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating Trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power.\\\\nSome have claimed that since Clinton won the popular vote, she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws. Others have argued that the Republican Party right-wing elites rigged the election . However true, there will be no recall this time around. Why? The DNC and the Clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat Sanders. In a stunning shift of political legitimacy, the Democratic Party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its Republican Party counterparts.\\\\nNumerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet Trump will select. Indeed, Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s possibilities do not deviate from the standard Republican Party makeup. His potential choices for top positions include \"tough on crime\" Rudy Giuliani, austerity magnate Chris Christie, and privatization enthusiast Newt Gingrich. However, for the first time in a long time, the President of the United States is accountable to something other than the ruling class. In the past, Republican Party and Democratic Party Presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized.\\\\nMORE... Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Brian Cloughley: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and Chinaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Arise President Trump (or Why it\\\\\\'s not the End of the World as We Know it) This is not the case with Trump. Just a month ago, Trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class . It was Trump\\\\\\'s petty bourgeois and working class base of white America that propelled him to victory. It is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel Trump to choose a neo-con Administration. But a neo-con agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against. Even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white American nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity. However, nothing less can be expected from the likes of Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.\\\\nThe contradictions of the Trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the Great Depression. White liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the two-party system. The neo-con establishment will have to confront Trump\\\\\\'s foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric, much of which is in direct antagonism with the GOP\\\\\\'s record. And the Democratic Party will attempt to use the age of Trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp.\\\\nHow should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions? First, the anti-war left needs to confront Trump\\\\\\'s foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back NATO and its escalation toward Russia. The left needs to resist any and all attempts by Trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals, such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the US nuclear arsenal. Of course, Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s rhetoric must be placed in its proper context. It was the Obama Administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to \"modernize\" the US nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years, a number unseen in US history. This means resistance to the Trump Administration\\\\\\'s use of the apparatus that Obama and the Democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class, not just one of the two parties that represent it.\\\\nThe vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the two-party system. As Don Debar of CPR News has made clear, the check of white supremacy simply doesn\\\\\\'t pay the same dividends anymore. While the wealth gap between White America and Black American would take over two centuries to even out , it is also true that merely ten percent White America owns almost all wealth in the US . Capitalism\\\\\\'s crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions. A unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the US and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it.\\\\nWhat is meant by â\\\\x80\\\\x9copportunityâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results. It should be imperative that the left force Trump\\\\\\'s hand on foreign policy. It should demand that Trump use his executive powers to force through a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the US. The left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his Administration, with full recognition that it was Democratic and Republican Party consensus that got us here. As emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the United States, the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before Trump: class war.\\'\\n \\'Shadow Government in South Korea page: 1 archive.is... >being a ... >since 2~3 years ago there was Ancient Aliens tier rumor that president Park is indoctrinated and being controled by handful of secret society called \"8ì\\\\x84\\\\xa0ë\\\\x85\\\\x80 (The 8 Goddess)\", and they\\\\\\'re ruling Korea from behind >everyone laughed at this crude joke rumor >suddenly a week ago whistleblower confirmed this # was real >the 8 powerful Korean billionaire women formed secret society and ruled Korea from behind the veil >whistleblower stole PC and tablets from them, opened to media, confirming they did it all >they made decisions, from Park\\\\\\'s text of speeches, reforming taxes by their own, maintaining national treasury, deciding every diplomatic moves from toe toe, assigning secretaries and ministers by their own >only 1 members of The 8 Goddess identity confirmed, it\\\\\\'s former psychic woman named \\\\\\'Choi Sun-sil\\\\\\' >according to the leak she indoctrinated President Park since age of 23 >yes, a psychic woman who\\\\\\'s member of secret society indoctrinated the president >I ain\\\\\\'t joking >tfw everyone didn\\\\\\'t believed this anime plot tier ba# insane absurd news >seriously who\\\\\\'s gonna believe this >then suddenly president Park made news conference yesterday >SHE CONFIRMED THIS LEAK IS REAL AND ASKED FORGIVENESS >tfw a country\\\\\\'s president confirming that she\\\\\\'s indoctrinated by the secret society at the news conference >EVERYONE PANIC >people started to get #s together >gathering informations about them >after digging it\\\\\\'s confirmed that # loads of men are in jail right now for leaking the truth about The 8 Goddess >politicians who\\\\\\'s in jail right now mentioned Choi and 8 Goddess right before they went jail >people found photos that Choi escorting Park since her age of early 20\\\\\\'s >diggings found US ambassador report documents >it saying \"Choi Tae-Min (Choi Sun Sil\\\\\\'s father) is fully control of Park\\\\\\'s body and soul\" >Choi Sun Sil\\\\\\'s whereabouts is mystery, she\\\\\\'s somewhere in Germany edit on 27-10-2016 by WindCharger because: (no reason given) edit on 27-10-2016 by WindCharger because: (no reason given)\\'\\n \\'Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland. Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes, slightly quicker than expected. The Boeing 777-200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival - a tradition for airlines on new routes. Carriers like to talk up these records, but how are they measured and do they really matter? Longest (time) or furthest (distance) are the two key distinctions to make, but it\\\\\\'s not as simple as it might sound. The distance between two cities doesn\\\\\\'t vary for airlines of course, but they might choose to take alternative routes. For example, a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B. And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes. In October last year, Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic - a direction switch which added an extra 1,400km to the journey, making the 15,127km trip the longest ever non-stop flight by distance. By comparison, Qatar\\\\\\'s new route is 14,535km. But regardless of the route, flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds. For example, Qatar\\\\\\'s return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds. And though Air India went the \"long way round\", favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about two-and-a-half hours less than its conventional route. \"The longest flying time doesn\\\\\\'t always correspond with the longest distance,\" says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal. \"Of course, from a passenger perspective, the flying time is probably the best measurement.\" Record-breaking flights may make headlines. But new long-haul flights mean nothing if they\\\\\\'re treated as a standalone route, says Mr Taylor. Rather, it\\\\\\'s what a new route brings to the airline\\\\\\'s existing network. \"On its own, it wouldn\\\\\\'t be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha, but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe, Africa, the US or elsewhere,\" says Mr Taylor. \"In that light, even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective, it may help the economics of its wider network.\" Historically, most of the major long-haul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australia\\\\\\'s Qantas. But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar, and perhaps most notably Emirates, to expand their business very rapidly. \"It\\\\\\'s also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other,\" says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratings.com. Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes, and the range capability of aircraft improves. Last year, for example, Qantas revealed it would fly direct between Perth and London from March 2018, a flight that will take 17 hours. The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes \"With the arrival of the 777-8X in 2022, new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set,\" says Mr Thomas. \"The 777-8X will be the ultimate long haul airliner.\" But remember, for routes to be viable, they also require people to buy tickets. That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16, 17 or maybe 18 hours at a time. How long that desire will last (especially for travellers cramped up in economy) is something airlines will monitor carefully.\\'\\n \\'43 Shares\\\\n8 34 0 1\\\\nISIS terrorists have executed scores more people around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul this week and are reported to be stockpiling dangerous chemicals in civilian areas, the U.N. human rights office said on Friday.\\\\nA mass grave with over 100 bodies found in the town of Hammam al-Alil was one of several ISIS killing grounds, spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said.

That sets two theoretically equal branches of the government against one another - and could bring about a crisis. The separation of powers is crucial to understanding how the US is governed. The country\\\\\\'s constitution established its treasured system of checks and balances - where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another. The federal government\\\\\\'s power is split into three distinct parts - the executive branch, which includes the president and his cabinet; the legislative branch, Congress, which makes the laws; and the judiciary. This works well most of the time, with each branch co-operating with the next. But with the president in open conflict with another branch, there are fears that an impasse could be reached. That could lead to a constitutional crisis - a scenario in which the situation cannot be resolved - particularly after Mr Trump seemed to openly question the judge\\\\\\'s authority. \"The President\\\\\\'s hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous,\" Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, from the Senate judiciary committee, said. \"He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\" There are about 700 federal district judges in the US - the type facing down the president\\\\\\'s order. Unlike state court judges, these men and women are part of the federal court system - along with the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals. Day to day, it\\\\\\'s the 94 District Courts which deal with interpretation of US laws, treaties, and public officials - powers devolved to them from the Supreme Court. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made... But the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked - they only interpret law when a case is brought before them. The other two branches of government make and enforce the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is a dispute. That is the issue here - a presidential executive order has all the force of law, and is subject to the same checks. Those judicial powers have been used many times before. Barack Obama faced stumbling blocks in 2015 when he attempted to use an executive order to grant a reprieve to undocumented immigrants, and George W Bush faced similar battles over detainees in Guantanamo Bay. It is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Judge James Robart, for example - the \"so-called judge\" of Mr Trump\\\\\\'s Twitter criticism - was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004. But Mr Trump can\\\\\\'t fire judges. That\\\\\\'s because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference. Only Congress can remove a federal judge from office through impeachment, which involves both the House and Senate. It is the same system used to remove a president. This \"article three\" protection is, in practical terms, very rigid. Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States. The end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire - or until death. In effect, two of the country\\\\\\'s three branches of government are in conflict - and neither can remove the other. Inside the mind of Donald Trump Which executive actions will have the most impact? Tech world caught between Trump and a liberal place The Supreme Court, as the name implies, has ultimate power in the judiciary - the other courts are inferior to it. In this case, the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court - and may still do so. Nine seats make up the court Four were appointed by Democrats: two by President Clinton, and two by President Obama Four were appointed by Republican Presidents: George W Bush, George Bush Snr, and Ronald Reagan One seat is vacant following the death of Antonin Scalia. Just as with the other federal courts, though, the Supreme Court is protected from interference. But there are currently only eight judges on the Supreme Court. Four were appointed by a Democrat, and four by a Republican - with one vacant seat waiting to be filled by Mr Trump\\\\\\'s nominee, which could swing the balance of power. Congress could break any deadlock that crops up between the president and the judiciary by creating a law that overturns his decision - or even impeaching a president or judge. Since Mr Trump\\\\\\'s Republican party holds a majority there, action against the president seems unlikely. And the independence of the courts is so essential to the US way of governing, that moving to attack judges on behalf of the president would be a drastic step. Nonetheless, with two of the three powers in conflict, the decision may fall to Congress eventually - unless Mr Trump modifies his order. That may be the most prudent move, in keeping with his predecessors who have often backed off in the face of judicial opposition. For now, though, Mr Trump \"just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril\" - and shows no signs of changing his mind.\\'\\n \\'November 3, 2016 By Shawn Helton 1 Comment \\\\nShawn Helton 21st Century Wire \\\\nThe cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street. \\\\nAs the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton â\\\\x80\\\\x99s email server case â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week. \\\\nThe financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Letâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long agoâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98MONEY CHANGERSâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Wall Streetâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE) \\\\nThe Clintons & Goldman Sachs \\\\nWhile campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street. \\\\nAt the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachsâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nIn 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d received the largest share of his financial supportâ\\\\x80\\\\x93at least $2.6 millionâ\\\\x80\\\\x93from lawyers and lobbyists,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and that Clinton also received additional support from â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nFor decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cOver 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s charitable programs.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nBy now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades. \\\\nThe real watershed moment came hereâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nBLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98Key to the Kingdomâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\nIn one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely. \\\\nThe Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act , which banking luminaries cynically named the â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999â\\\\x80³ officially titled the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act . The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the â\\\\x80\\\\x98shadow bankingâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked. \\\\nSimply put: Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking â\\\\x80\\\\x93 which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite â\\\\x80\\\\x93 which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy husband did so well with the economy.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Really? \\\\nIn a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post , Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990â\\\\x80\\\\x99s: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbandâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s years in office.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nPrins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled â\\\\x80\\\\x9c It Takes a Pillage : Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nPrins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world. \\\\nThe media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the â\\\\x80\\\\x98Citi-Travelers Actâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administrationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act , but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroupâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAt the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal , as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther . In 1999 , after â\\\\x80\\\\x9c12 attempts in 25 years,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act , which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. \\\\nThe repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroupâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation : \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997â\\\\x80\\\\x9398 election cycleâ\\\\x80\\\\x94a figure sure to be topped in 1999â\\\\x80\\\\x932000.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nHow much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House? \\\\nIn 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events. \\\\nIn 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said â\\\\x80\\\\x9cs he sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d according to a quote obtained by Politico . Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October , the Democratic nominee believes in â\\\\x80\\\\x9cboth a public and a private positionâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d on Wall Street reform and that it is an â\\\\x80\\\\x9c oversimplificationâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis. \\\\nThat Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s only the tip of a much larger iceberg. \\\\nIn 2015, the Washington Post reported that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98ANOINTEDâ\\\\x80\\\\x99: Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. \\\\nThe Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton â\\\\x80\\\\x98joinedâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦$12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky , a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelseaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation. \\\\nMarc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity , after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million â\\\\x80\\\\x93 after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt. \\\\nThe apple doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t fall far from the treeâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nAs it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky â\\\\x80\\\\x93 another close friend of Team Clinton. \\\\nPolitico reports on one of Ed Mezvinskyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s financial controversies in 1999: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the waning days of Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. â\\\\x80\\\\x9c \\\\nContinuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinskyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s wife to then President Bill Clinton: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife â\\\\x80\\\\x94 ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.) â\\\\x80\\\\x94 pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIn 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cChelsea Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds. Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation. That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times , and will now be closed.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98THE INSIDERSâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 A ground-breaking ceremony at Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan in 2005.

That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x98HOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCEâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews ) The Wall Street Racket To understand who powers the Clinton Foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cGoldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bankâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday. \\\\nAuthorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims. \\\\nThis resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIn 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanleyâ\\\\x80\\\\x94but not Lehman Brothersâ\\\\x80\\\\x94to become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fedâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.)â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAll told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession. \\\\nIn a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cData gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project , a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98CASHING OUTâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) \\\\nWall Street Selects â\\\\x80\\\\x98Team Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\nThe Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990â\\\\x80\\\\x99s as Robert Rubin , a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the â\\\\x80\\\\x98Rubinomicsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class , in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time. \\\\nAccording to Congressional record ( Vol.146 part 2 ), â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5% â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIn a Multinational Monitor report entitled â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWall Streetâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d by Robert Weissman and James Donahue , a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990â\\\\x80\\\\x99s under the Clinton administration was revealed: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cDuring the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933. â\\\\x80¦ U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nWith a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group , Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Hereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have to view people in a fair light,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98SWORNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 FBI director James Comey sworn in by former DOJ head Eric Holder.

Hereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cMany will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a bank implicated in international money laundering , including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels. Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIn 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBCâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s controversial Swiss bank. \\\\nLeaked files from HSBCâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nA new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week.

TRENDING ON 21WIRE \\'\\n \\'President Trump\\\\\\'s first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind. His second week has been no less hectic. Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings, the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook. In a divided America, many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration, while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done. Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland. On Friday, a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days, banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The immediacy of the announcement, which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for \"bad dudes\" to sneak in, caused widespread confusion at airports around the world. Families were separated, and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban. An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports. Around the world, travellers were prevented from boarding planes, and in some cases, were pulled off flights. Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired. An Iran-born BBC reporter with British citizenship was among those temporarily detained. Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest, with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released. Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks. Things were working out \"very nicely\", he said. Steve Gruber, a popular talk-show host in Michigan, summed up the mood among many Trump voters. Listeners, he said, \"are encouraged that a politician, albeit a new one, is actually doing the things he said he would do\". Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented, but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings. As condemnation grew, including from a few top Republicans, many foreign governments and major US companies, the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban, pointing to the many Muslim-majority countries not involved. Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim, admitting to Fox News that Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims. He said, however, that the ban implemented was based on \"danger\", not religion. Sean Spicer, the White House\\\\\\'s combative press secretary, blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel \"ban\", even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter. Meanwhile, the world tried to figure out the unique language on display at protests in Scotland. The immigration order\\\\\\'s fallout dominated headlines for most of this week. \"This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House,\" our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. Amateur hour at the White House? But President Trump\\\\\\'s supporters think he\\\\\\'s doing a great job. The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone. In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban, acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trump\\\\\\'s executive order. Within hours, she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of \"betraying\" her department and being \"weak on borders\". Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government. But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty. The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated. As news spread on Monday that hundreds of US diplomats around the world were planning to use a \"dissent channel\" to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer, Sean Spicer said \"they should either get with the programme or they can go\". That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views. On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony, Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court - Judge Neil Gorsuch, of Colorado. The Democrats, whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity, have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate. The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights. Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago, the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices, at four each. Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant, though justices don\\\\\\'t always split on clear ideological lines. Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice, but the Republicans didn\\\\\\'t allow it given an election was forthcoming. Like the late Mr Scalia, the Ivy-League educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. Who is Neil Gorsuch? Why is the US Supreme Court so important? House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee \"a very hostile appointment\" and \"a very bad decision, well outside the mainstream of American legal thought\". And of course, there were more protests. Stephen Bannon, Donald Trump\\\\\\'s chief strategist, is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks. The former executive chairman of populist, conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a \"rumpled right-wing agitator\" by the New York Times. On Saturday night, he was given a seat on the National Security Council\\\\\\'s inner circle, or principals\\\\\\' committee. Under the restructuring, the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas. The move shocked many Washington veterans. \"It\\\\\\'s completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group,\" Eliot Cohen, director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told the BBC. Mr Bannon has a \"destructive\" world view and has accumulated an \"unhealthy\" level of power, he said, describing it as an \"ominous\" move. What exactly is his destructive world view? Well, according to the Daily Beast, in 2013 Bannon said he wanted \"to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today\\\\\\'s establishment\". The White House tried to brush the changes off, pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrod had been included in some council meetings. Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as \"Darth Vader\" in a recent interview where he described US media as \"the opposition party\". Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security, and thus global stability, are discussed at a very, very senior level. Refugees are very much on President Trump\\\\\\'s radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals. But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM, which was scheduled to last for an hour, was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes. President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull, in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations, was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders. In fact, the Washington Post reported that Mr Trump described the conversation as \"the worst by far\". He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter - a deal struck with the Obama administration which would see up to 1,250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US. What next? President Trump was so worked up after discussing \"the worst deal ever\" that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner - via Twitter. Mr Trump tweeted that he would \"study this dumb deal\". Later, Mr Spicer gave an official version of his boss\\\\\\'s 25-minute call with Mr Turnbull. He said that both leaders had \"emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship\". Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal. Trump\\\\\\'s first week: Well, that was intense\\'\\n \"link originally posted by: JinMI Lots of discussion over the past months.

Watch: \\\\n. \\'\\n \\'\\\\n\\'\\n \\'Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles\\\\\\'s Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? \"It\\\\\\'s trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,\" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. \"Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,\" it says. \"This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space.\" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. \"But it doesn\\\\\\'t have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,\" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. \"The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,\" says Business in the Community. \"Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact.\" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: \"There can also be confusion about what can or can\\\\\\'t be recycled with bathroom products. \"For example many people don\\\\\\'t realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it\\\\\\'s empty and put the lid back on. \"Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up.\" Research from the University of Exeter also found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being \"dirty\" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can\\\\\\'t be recycled can seem off-putting,\" says Business in the Community. It added: \"There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols.\" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. \"In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,\" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. \"Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,\" it added. \"For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials.\" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? \"Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,\" says Recycle Now. \"It would save ?135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. \"On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times.\" But what if you don\\\\\\'t have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items.\\'\\n \\'BREAKING BOMBSHELL! FBI NYPD INSIDERS LEAK - Email Scandal About to Take a SICK and TWISTED Turn    \\\\nSource: Victurus Libertas  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAll of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific first-hand knowledge of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weiner\\\\\\'s computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedin\\\\\\'sâ\\\\x80¦ and pay to play â\\\\x80\\\\x93 including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary USED to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Huma\\\\\\'s computer. \\\\n\\\\nIt has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine. \\\\nFurthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service , with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham! An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department TOP SECRET emails. One file was called \"Life Insurance\". A second file was titled \" DNC Nuclear Arsenal \". \\\\n\\\\nA third file I\\\\\\'m sure Hillary definitely DOES NOT want released was a file labeled \"Intimate\" â\\\\x80¦ according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a TEENAGER . \\\\n\\\\nNYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not \"step up and take off the kid gloves\" . At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information. \\\\n\\\\nAs you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison , as well as Bill and Hillary. The Twitter post below, our sources sent us, verifying it is all true: \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEven MORE! \\\\n\\\\nThe following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year: \\\\n\\\\nJim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible. \\\\n\\\\nComey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama . The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared \"The Untouchables\" after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness. \\\\n\\\\nComey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted . One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc. \\\\n\\\\nAs it turns out, Weiner, Huma\\\\\\'s husband, had been forwarding Huma\\\\\\'s emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, ESPIONAGE is strongly suspected. \\\\nComey and his 40 \" Untouchables \" are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American historyâ\\\\x80¦ which is what I think MUST happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again. The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call \" creatives \". Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301 , which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a DEAD BOX whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe. \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve heard it said \"A vagina almost took down Bill, now will a Weiner take down Hillary?\" LOL! \\\\n\\\\nAgain, thank you to all of the insiders, the whistleblowers, the good FBI agents, the good CIA agents, the good NYPD officers, and the non-corrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed! Without these brave, wonderful, and morally erect individuals, our country would still be in the corrupted darkness. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVistors to Epstein\\\\\\'s Little St. James Island include: \\\\n\\\\nâ\\\\x80¢ Ehud Barak , the former Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001) â\\\\x80\\\\x93 pedophile being procured underage girls by Epstein.

Question 2 deals with the stateâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s charter school cap. Without the cap, upwards of 12 charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year. The charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofMassachusetts in large part due to the Obama Administration. A vote \"no\" is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nation-wide. As Massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next President of the United States, it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in Washington.\\\\nThe Obama Administration immediately created the Race to the Top program after the 2008 election. This program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it. The Department of Education funneled billions of US dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district. Federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor, mostly Black cities as long as these districts met the \"mandates\" of the program. These mandates included the closure of \"failing schools,\" mergers with for-profit charter schools, and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories. Race to the Top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire US public education system.\\\\nThe results have been disastrous. Hundreds of public schools have closed around the country. Tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired. In New Orleans, nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by \" publicly funded\" charter schools .The Chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in 2013 .\\\\nThe impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures. Charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class. The Civil Rights Project of UCLA has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools . Furthermore, charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves. All the while, these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against ELS and disabled students.\\\\nIn addition, charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education. Charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates. Corporate charter operators also \"cream\" students from the top and toss the rest. Even so, charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores . What the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite, which has masterfully used media and non-profit manipulation to demonize public education.\\\\nThe usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in Massachusetts. The New York Lobbying group \"Families for Excellent Schools\" is controlled by Hedge Fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the Walton Family (i.e. Wal-Mart). Another organization, \"Education Reform Now Advocacy,\" has received upwards of 11 million dollars from the same source . Charter schools are often labeled \"public\" because they receive tax payer dollars. However, the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them.\\\\nA \"Yes\" vote on Question two would place the education of students in Massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization. Not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval, but forty-five public schools would be in danger of closure. Over 100 million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state. At the moment, the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than 72 charter schools. If the cap islifted, however, this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students, families, and educatorsvictimto the \"shock and awe\" privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades.\\\\nOpposition to privatization is being led by the organization Save Our Schools. Save Our Schools consists of families, teachers, students, and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the Massachusetts public education system. Charter schools already drain 450 million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands. A vote \"no\" would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators.\\\\nA \"no\" vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the Massachusetts area over the last few years. The Boston School Bus Drivers union Local 8751 won a historic victory against the Veolia Corporation in 2015. The Harvard Dining Workers of Local 26 UNITE HERE followed by defeating Harvard\\\\\\'s bid to raise healthcare costs in October of 2016. Now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent full-scale privatization.\\\\nDoing so will not be easy. The model of union-management cooperationwith theDemocratic Party continues to prevent workers in Massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault. A vote \"no\" on question 2 in Massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful push-back against the forces behind privatization. However, a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a people\\\\\\'s movement. The fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote \"yes\" to.\\'\\n \"Mexico Declares Marijuana Use â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHuman Rightâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d In Supreme Court page: 1 The Mexican Supreme Court ruled by 4 to 1 that banning the consumption and cultivation of cannabis for personal use violates the human right to free development of oneâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s personality. â\\\\x80¦ â\\\\x80¦ Freedom To Smoke a Human Right.

Professor Hall is the editor-in-chief of the American Herald Tribune. He is author of several books, including a two-volume publishing project at McGill-Queenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s University Press entitled â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Bowl with One Spoonâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d; American Empire and the Fourth World: The Bowl with One Spoon, Part I (McGill-Queenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Native and Northern) Earth into Property: Colonization, Decolonization, and Capitalism: The Bowl with One Spoon, Part II (Mcgill-Queenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Native and Northern Series). The Part II edition was recently selected by The UK Independent as one of the best books of 2010. The Journal of the American Library Association called Earth into Property, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cA scholarly tour de force.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The books aim to set the 9/11 catastrophe and post 9/11 Wars in the context of global history, since 1492. Dr. Hall has been suspended and harshly pulled from his classroom, in mid-term without any process of arbitration: namely, for having expressed his viewpoints on Israeli crimes, calling for an open debate on the Holocaust and 9/11, despite being promoted to a Full Professor rank through a process of peer review. In an exclusive interview with Khamenei.ir Professor Hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the West:\\\\nAyatollah Khamenei has stated that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgenuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress. In the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere, there can be no opportunity for growth.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d How do youâ\\\\x80\\\\x93 as a Professorâ\\\\x80\\\\x93 perceive it?\\\\nI reflected very self-consciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country Canada when I opted in the mid to late 1970s to go to graduate school at the University of Toronto. With the great Canadian historian, J.M.S. Careless, as my Ph.D. Supervisor I made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the First Nations of Canada. My course of study took me in 1982 to my first appointment in the Native Studies Department at the University of Sudbury. The University of Sudbury was in those years a Jesuit-run entity. It formed the institutional seed from which the secular Laurentian University would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there.\\\\nFor the next two decades I was able to work from my academic bases in Sudbury and then in Lethbridge Alberta beginning in 1990. At the invitation of the Leroy Little Bear, the Chair of the Department of Native American Studies I thus moved to the resource-rich province of Alberta. Once again I was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my I could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in Western Canada.\\\\nIn my years as a young professor I took an active part in four First Nations/First Ministers conferences that took place in Ottawa between 1983 and 1987. The purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Section 35, Constitution Act, 1982) .\\\\nMORE... The B\\'nai Brith and the History of the Mounting Assault on Academic Freedom in Canadian Universities Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Section 35 was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over Canadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s constitutional structure from the British imperial Mother Country to the domestic institutions of Canadian federalism.\\\\nThe culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a made-in-Canada version of the Canadian constitution involved my opposition between 1987 and 1990 to what became known as the Meech Lake accord. If this political deal between Canadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s First Ministers had become constitutional law, the First Nations of Canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of Canadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfundamental characteristic.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIn academic essays, in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees, I contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the Meech Lake accord for fair-minded Canadians supportive of existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. More specifically I contributed to the strength of the platform from which an Oji-Cree parliamentarian by the name of Elijah Harper used his veto power in the Manitoba Legislature to block the ratification of the Meech Lake accord. Because of Elijah Harperâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s actions the Meech Lake accord did not become part of Canadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9csupreme law.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nI was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of Canada until about the year 2000. Between 2000 and 2002 I had to adjust my work away from the activities of the Department of Native American Studies towards a field of my own making, Globalization Studies. I prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role. The core focus of my emphasis on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGlobalization Studiesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d was Indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from 1492 until the present.\\\\nIt is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student, Joshua Blakeney, that I began to shift focus towards the treatment of Palestinian and other Arab peoples in the region of Greater Israel, Eretz Israel. It was Joshua who also led me to my first interactions with Iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the New Horizon conference of the autumn of 2014. As I have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me.\\\\nDue to the intervention of my colleague, the Mohawk activist Splitting The Sky, I also began to see the events of 9/11 as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twenty-first century.\\\\nMy quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested. Certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor. Eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my University administration. In 2008 after what I took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member, I resolved that henceforth I would pursue difficult lines of research and publication. I made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action.\\\\nI have made no secret of the fact that I see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that Canada is on a downwards spiral. It seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities. If academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning, then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure.\\\\nThe first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students. They will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power. Our country, Canada, cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions.\\\\nAyatollah Khamenei believes â\\\\x80\\\\x9cexchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic workâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d; How is this principle practiced at Lethbridge University?\\\\nI agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities. I found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues, media and public officials in the years between 1982 and 2001 when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of Canada-First Nations relations.\\\\nUnfortunately I would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after 2008 when I began to question the official narrative of what happened on 9/11. Who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the Global War on Terror? As I began to become skeptical of the official narrative I noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest. To put it bluntly, I suppose it became clear to me that, for a number of reasons, it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of 9/11 specifically and false flag terrorism more generally.\\\\nAs I began to look more deeply into the existing research on 9/11 I was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law. My collaboration with Splitting The Sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former US President, George W. Bush, to give a talk in Calgary in 2009 as his first public engagement as (theoretically) a regular civilian citizen. Our collective action in Calgary in the spring of 2009 led to a trial that we dubbed Splitting The Sky versus George W. Bush . Although I had not yet associated the lies and crimes of 9/11 with Israel First protagonists, I ran into my first Zionist pushback for my 9/11 studies when I presented my essay, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould George W. Bush Be Arrested in Calgary, Alberta, To Be Tried For International Crimes?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d I originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the University of Winnipeg.\\\\nMy essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as Splitting The Sky versus George W. Bush . Our stance was that the former US President should have been arrested in Canada for being a credibly-accused war criminal. We were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that Bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against, for instance, prohibited torture. Not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former US President had violated Canadaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s own Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act . The legislation had passed through Parliament with the view that Canada should not become a haven for war criminals.\\\\nIn pursuing this line of analysis I faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was anti-Semitic.\\\\nAs I worked on this subject, one that I integrated into my pedagogy, it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victorâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy. It seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice. Those on the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwinningâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d side, the stronger side, are invariably held to be above the law.\\\\nThis line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities. The most fruitful collaboration to develop, however, was that with Dr. Kevin Barrett who had lost his academic position at the University of Wisconsin for incorporating 9/11-related subjects into his research and pedagogy.\\\\nFor sure I should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of 9/11, the most transformative event of the twenty-first century. In my view the academic institutions in North America and Europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of 9/11. I am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of Islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of Muslim-majority countries.\\\\nIn a meeting with President Rouhani and his Cabinet, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of Islam, the West suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression. However, when it comes to the Holocaust, there is no freedom of expression!â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Why do you think we witness such double standards?\\\\nA gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfreedomâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is being defined in the so-called â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWest.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The psychological operations attending the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe Are Charlie Hebdoâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d ceremonies on Paris in early 2015 epitomized the hypocrisy. The whole essence of this strange event in the city of Lights seemed to signal that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfreedom of speech and expressionâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d in the West is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of Prophet Mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of Islamic religion. The other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on, for instance, the French comedian Mâ\\\\x80\\\\x99bala Mâ\\\\x80\\\\x99bala DieudonnÃ©. DieudonnÃ© was barred from entering Canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to Jews, Jewish institutions or the activities of Israel these days.\\\\nOne of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brith equate my call for open debate on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe holocaust,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and indeed open debate on all subjects, as the equivalent of so-called â\\\\x80\\\\x9cholocaust denial.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d How many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation? How many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research, teaching and publication?\\\\nThere is a controversial Quote: from Ayatollah Khamenei in which he saysâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 â\\\\x80\\\\x9cMay God curse all those who put an end to political thoughts, work and endeavor in universitiesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s your take on that? How essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia?\\\\nI agree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Leaderâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s observation. One of the great gifts of the Creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality. Our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought, work and endeavor.\\\\nThis type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression, elaboration, and receptiveness. Indeed we need to make ourselves expert in Universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse. God curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse.\"\\n \\'Hyperbole is odious.\\\\nThis is not a bad article for the most part, but the title, \"Will America Survive the Next 4 Years?\" , and the words in the last paragraph, \"it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of Donald Trump\" , are clickbait silly.\\\\nIf America could survive Slick Willie Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama/Hillary (even though millions of foreign people did not survive their regimes), then it will survive Mr. Trump.\\\\nThere is even a fair chance that Trump will not be worse than his predecessors.\\'\\n \"Kingdomâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s energy minister says move would risk damaging the US economy. 2 Shares\\\\n1 0 0 1\\\\nSaudi Arabia has warned Donald Trump that the incoming US president will risk the health of his countryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports.\\\\nOver the course of the two-year American election process, Republican nominee Trump promised on the campaign trail to divest U.S. interests from â\\\\x80\\\\x9cour foes and the oil cartels,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d referring mainly to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which the KSA is the largest producer and de facto leader.\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt his heart President-elect Trump will see the benefits and I think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Khalid al-Falih , chairman of Aramco and Saudi Aramco Oil Minister, told the Financial Times in Marrakesh, where world leaderâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s are currently negotiating the nuts and bolts of the landmark 2015 climate change agreement.\\\\nSaudi Arabia is the U.S.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 largest Middle Eastern oil supplier, though the North American country gets most of its energy from domestic and Canadian sources.\\\\nAl-Falih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the United States because it has created a refining industry and ignited a job-hungry shale revolution.\\\\nMORE...

They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. \\\\n\\\\nPolice were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don\\\\\\'t understand their business. \\\\n\\\\nThe search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. \\\\n\\\\nThe warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet\\\\\\'s operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. \\\\n\\\\nPolice note that Starnet\\\\\\'s revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday\\\\\\'s raid and seizure of company materials. \\\\n\\\\nRCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, \"They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid.\" Starnet\\\\\\'s many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. \\\\n\\\\nIn written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. \\\\n\\\\nThe Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.\" \\\\n\\\\n\"Super Serco bulldozes ahead  \\\\nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER UPDATED: 23:00 GMT, 1 September 2004 \\\\nSERCO has come a long way since the 1960s when it ran the \\\\\\'four-minute warning\\\\\\' system to alert the nation to a ballistic missile attack. \\\\n\\\\nToday its Â£10.3bn order book is bigger than many countries\\\\\\' defence budgets.

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\"Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE (born 5 July 1963 in Durban, South Africa)[1] was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 2013.[2] â\\\\x80¦ On graduation, he worked for Arthur Andersen.

With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \\\\n\\\\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol (\\\\\\'https\\\\\\' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \\\\n\\\\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \\\\n\\\\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \\\\n\\\\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \\\\n\\\\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \\\\n\\\\nBase One Technologies â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Corporate Strategy â\\\\x80\\\\x93 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \\\\nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

Like yourself, we all have been stunned by the voracity of Dr. Mahonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s action. We used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the Establishment. We all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group. However, Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brith is not just a special interest group, it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west. Allow me to elaborate.\\\\nYou have correctly identified Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brith to be â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbehind this movement against shutting down free speech.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d While this statement is accurate, this phenomenon of targeting Canadian universities and Canadian society is not something that started now. Not too long ago, it used to be branded as â\\\\x80\\\\x98the hidden hand behind the hidden handâ\\\\x80\\\\x99. During the Harper era, this operation became a full-blown politically driven policy directive. The legislation that Dr. Mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the Harper era. Harper had an extremist right-wing background and organizations like Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda. As early as the 1980s, I personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of Muslim Student Association at the University of Alberta. Although Harper didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t attend that university, we were not too far from the epicentre of the neo-conservatism movement that was brewing in Canada. We fast-forward 30 years and come upon the type of events such as Professor Hall travesty that are products of that time. In fact, a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of Canadian lives. Only recently, we had this court ruling against Canadian Security Intelligence Service that was illegally spying on the public. This gangster-like involvement started in 2006, shortly after Harper and the neocon came to power.\\\\nThis is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government. In fact, the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime. Take for instance the case of Omar Khadr travesty .\\\\nMORE... Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Irish human rights activists against freedom of speech? This case is something we had known, albeit too late to intervene at the time, and has been subsequently discredited publicly, even during the Harper regime . The overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely 16 year old, Omar Khadr, who said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c You donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t care about me â\\\\x80\\\\x9d. This is what defines the mindset of these people, bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience.\\\\nThe attack on Professor Hall was particularly toxic, but equally sinister attacks have taken place before. Some decade ago, now defunct Canadian Islamic Congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring. It was the largest Muslim Organization at a time Canadian Muslims became the largest religious minority. One particular episode involved Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brithâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s planted story involving a University professor, who became the target of hate crime, while at the same time investigated for hate crime. If it wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t for the humane and civic behaviour of the then University president (current Governor General), David Johnston, it would have become career threatening, if not life threatening event of the professor. Top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from â\\\\x80\\\\x98donorsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena. The vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today. What we donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing.\\\\nClearly, some of the faithful members/sympathizers apply it publicly. Such was the case of former professor turned politician, Irwin Cotler, who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia. Then there are others, such as Alan Rock of University of Ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia. A third group would be Lorna Marsden of York University that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda. Yet, others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence. It doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t matter which category they belong to, they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and, for some cases, join in to the atrocity. This obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late Professor David Noble, who ended up suing York University and Canadian Jewish Congress jointly for conspiring against him. Professor Noble, a Jew himself, faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of Jews. That wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t enough, Dr. Noble had to take on Human Rights Commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the University authority. Professor Noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon University of Ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of Alan Rock, a man without a PhD that was at the helm of the University. Mr. Rock recently left the Universityâ\\\\x80\\\\x94but not before leaving the Universityâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s good name in the sewerage of politicking. What Dr. Mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim.\\\\nHad I not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last 30 years, I would almost not understand what is at works here. In old days, such tactic would be unheard-of in a University. Certainly, such things couldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen in a civilized country, I would exclaim.\\\\nSo, what happened to Professor Hall is not new. What is new is the waking up of the general public. Your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about Professor Hall. People are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice. For instance, in the context of CSIS, an activist, Jim Comeau wrote, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would say it\\'s time to jail the highest ranking CSIS to send a clear message to the rest of them, do something illegal, straight to prison. They damn well knew what they were doing was illegal.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Peopleâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of Julian Assange, who wrote on US General election day (November 8, 2016):\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cYet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94because none exists.\\\\nIn the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nOf course, recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the United States.\\\\nTo anyone with an iota of conscience, there is no mystery here. People are making their voice clearly known. In the words of Claire Lanyado, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The problem is, when a president of University for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately, there is no recourse for a professor to fight him/her. In other cases, if such atrocity were launched against a student (e.g. the case of Freeman-Maloy vs. Lorna Marsden of York University ), the student, an anti-Zionist Jew, could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another Jewish lawyer, Peter Rosenthal (who himself is a University professor of Mathematics). It was struck down by the court, and then it was overruled by the court of appeals. At the end, the University settled and Dr. Marsden, the embattled President was gone. The morale of this story is, the path to justice is steep, but for a professor, the path to justice is becoming impossible.\\\\nThe irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes, just because they dare speak out against an atrocity. Of course, they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice.\\\\nThatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s how extremism works.\\\\n Sincerely,\\\\nRafiq Islam\"\\n \\'By Dan Dicks Tim Hortons Doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t Want You To See The Truth.

Since qubits are what makes up quantum computers... That being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on, off, or both on and off at the same time. In usual computing... Transistors are either on or off. In quantum they can be both on and off at the same time... The question I have is simply this. Is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on, off, and on and off at the same time... Even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor? I mean. A normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state. If it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state. Couldn\\\\\\'t you make the voltage extra high to get a both on/off at the same time state? Or half voltage to get the same on/off state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario? There might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an on/off state but couldn\\\\\\'t it be possible? Perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both on/off by checking the voltage some how? Idk... Please answer me like I\\\\\\'m a drunk stupid idiot. Perhaps laymen terms? I can be quite the idiot sometimes. Thanks for hearing me out. I\\\\\\'m currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to: DaRAGE I\\\\\\'m sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit, but that doesn\\\\\\'t really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology (which has been highly refined). The advantage of the qbit isn\\\\\\'t really that it stores more information, it\\\\\\'s that it can be used to process more information at the same time. Quantum + computing = quantum computing The key features of an ordinary computerâ\\\\x80\\\\x94bits, registers, logic gates, algorithms, and so onâ\\\\x80\\\\x94have analogous features in a quantum computer. Instead of bits, a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits, which work in a particularly intriguing way. Where a bit can store either a zero or a 1, a qubit can store a zero, a one, both zero and one, or an infinite number of values in betweenâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and be in multiple states (store multiple values) at the same time! If that sounds confusing, think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time, SchrÃ¶dinger\\\\\\'s cat being alive and dead, or a car being a bicycle and a bus. A gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition (where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals). If you blow on something like a flute, the pipe fills up with a standing wave: a wave made up of a fundamental frequency (the basic note you\\\\\\'re playing) and lots of overtones or harmonics (higher-frequency multiples of the fundamental). The wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously: they\\\\\\'re added together to make a combined wave that includes them all. Qubits use superposition to represent multiple states (multiple numeric values) simultaneously in a similar way. Just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once, so it can process them simultaneously.

This deeply offended many people who see Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s racist and misogynistic rhetoric as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cunpresidential.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow summed up this view: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI respect the presidency; I do not respect this president-elect.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d That the president-elect should not be respected is a given. But why should we respect the presidency?\\\\nThe Imperial Presidency of the United States has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial. Arguably, the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war. The Constitution specifically reserves this right for Congress. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, directs the wars that Congress declares. However, starting with Trumanâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s intervention in the Korean War in 1950 and continuing with invasions of Vietnam, Grenada, Iraq and Afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries, the Presidentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized. Congress has not declared war since 1941 despite the fact the U.S. military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world.\\\\nIn recent years, George W. Bush assumed the power to kidnap, torture, and assassinate any individual, anywhere in the world, at any time, without even a pretense of due process. Upon replacing Bush, Barack Obama legitimized Bushâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s kidnapping and torture (by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims) while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will. Noam Chomsky said Obama has trashed the 800-year-old Magna Carta, which King John of England would have approved of.\\\\nCan there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will? While American presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes, pass legislation, or incarcerate without charges inside U.S. borders, the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator.\\\\nThere has not been a single American president since World War II that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the Nuremberg trials.\\\\nRooseveltâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Executive Order 9066 to imprison Japanese Americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\\\nMORE... Wayne Madsen: The CIA Has Always Served the Interests of Wall Street Trump Won, Now What? Will America Survive the Next 4 Years? Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Trumanâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s firebombing of Tokyo, nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and invasion of Korea violated provisions of multiple treaties that are considered the â\\\\x80\\\\x9csupreme law of the landâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d per Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.\\\\nEisenhowerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s use of the CIA to overthrow democratically elected presidents in Iran and Guatemala, as well as the initiation of a terrorist campaign against Cuba, violated the UN Charter, another international treaty that the Constitution regards as the supreme law of the land.\\\\nKennedy was guilty of approving the creation of a mercenary army to invade Cuba, as well as covert warfare in Vietnam. Johnson massively escalated U.S. military involvement in Vietnam with the introduction of ground troops, which he fraudulently justified to the public through misrepresentation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident.\\\\nSucceeding Johnson, Nixon waged a nearly genocidal air campaign against not only Vietnam but Cambodia and Laos, killing hundreds of thousands of people, destroying ecosystems across Indochina, and leaving an unfathomable amount of unexploded ordnance , which continues to kill and maim hundreds of people each year.\\\\nFord covertly supported the South African invasion of Angola and overtly supported the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. Carter continued support of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, as well as providing military support to military dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador. Reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in Nicaragua, sponsored military dictatorships throughout Central America, and directly invaded Grenada.\\\\nBush the Elder invaded Panama and Iraq. Clinton oversaw sanctions in Iraq that killed as many as 1 million people, carried out an air war from 15,000 feet against Serbia, and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that produced medications for half the country. Bush the Lesser invaded and occupied Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama continued both of those wars, as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries.\\\\nSo I beg to differ with Blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect. Any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person.\\\\nLiberal Clinton defender Matt Yglesias argues that from a historical perspective, Trump is uniquely dangerous. â\\\\x80\\\\x9c(P)ast presidents,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Yglesias writes, â\\\\x80\\\\x9chave simply been restrained by restraint . By a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face. As we have seen, every single American president since at least WWII has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death, destruction and misery across the world, from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender.\\\\nWhen Trump assumes the presidency, he will inherit a frightening surveillance/military/incarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program; a vast NSA domestic and international spying network; a death squad (the Joint Special Operations Command); and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay.\\\\nPartisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwrongâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d hands. If Obama is at the helm, liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an American citizen without charge or trial every now and then. Conservatives trusted Bush to warrantlessly surveill Americans, but were outraged at the Snowden revelations.\\\\nPrincipled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority. The hand-wringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a Trump presidency ring hollow and hypocritical.\\\\nAmerican presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs, beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve. The occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power. It is what Dolores Vek describes as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cactually existing fascism.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Both parties have contributed to it, the media has normalized it, and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it.

Newton used eyewtiness accounts in the Principia when talking about comets. He came up with a theory on comets based on recorded sighting throughout the world like a boy saw a comet and this is what he described. There wasn\\'t any internet to even verify the credibility of these eyewitness accounts yet Newton used them to come up with a theory about comets which helped lead to his equations of Gravity. So if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable, how did Newton use them to come up with his theories? We also saw this with meteorites. This is from Wiki: Although meteors have been known since ancient times, they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the 19th century. Prior to that, they were seen in the West as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky. In 1807, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in Weston, Connecticut.[27] Silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin, but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of November 1833.[28] People all across the eastern United States saw thousands of meteors, radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant, as the point is now called, moved with the stars, staying in the constellation Leo.[29] ASTUTE OBSERVERS saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky and to this day this is still called the radient.

During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Trump was bribing the media â\\\\x80\\\\x93 at least thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. \\\\nIn her memoire â\\\\x80\\\\x9cSettle for More,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: \\\\nThe worst and most controversial of which was this: \\\\nAs the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. \\\\nWhile Kelly couldnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\nWhen it became obvious that some reporters were â\\\\x80\\\\x9cin the tankâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccertain TV hostsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t identify them by name or media outlet. \\\\nSource: Yahoo \\\\nKelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . \\\\nWhile bribing journalists isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t illegal, per say, it is highly unethical.

But we certainly know what Epstein did and, almost as outrageously, what he got away with doing . \\\\n\\\\nSome of the most shocking allegations against Epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an FBI probe, in civil suits brought by his victims: for example, the claim that three 12-year-old French girls were delivered to him as a birthday present. But the feds did identify roughly 40 young women, most of them underage at the time, who described being lured to Epstein\\\\\\'s Palm Beach home on the pretense of giving a \"massage\" for money, then pressured into various sex acts, as well as the \"Balkan sex slave\" Epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just 14. More recently, a big cash payment from Mail on Sunday coaxed one of Epstein\\\\\\'s main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy. This victim, Virginia Roberts, produced a photo of herself with Prince Andrew in 2001 and reported that Epstein paid her $15,000 to meet the prince. Then 17 years old, she claims that she was abused by Epstein and \"loaned\" to his friends from the age of 15. \\\\n\\\\nSex crimes of the kind Roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of 10 to 20 years in federal prison. Yet when all was said and done, Epstein served his scant year-plus-one-month in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail and was granted a 16-hour-per-day free pass to leave the premises for work. \\\\n\\\\nIn short, Epstein was never actually in jail. During his \"house arrest,\" he flew around the country on his jets from his New York City place to his private island. At least one of Epstein\\\\\\'s victims claimed to have met Bill Clinton. And it turns out that Bill Clinton was a much more regular passenger on the Lolita Express. \\\\n\\\\nFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\\\\\\'s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \"Lolita Express\" -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \\\\n\\\\nClinton\\\\\\'s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\\\\\\'s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \"Tatiana.\" The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. \\\\n\\\\nIt doesn\\\\\\'t help that the Democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting Epstein a pass on child rape, that Bill Clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the Clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money. \\\\n\\\\nEither way we\\\\\\'ve come a long way from Gary Hart being bounced for \"Monkey Business\" to Bill Clinton flying around on a child rapist\\\\\\'s plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it. \\\\n\\\\nSocial conservatives often get a bad rap. But there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window. What did Bill Clinton actually do? Who knows. More importantly these days, who cares \\\\n\\\\nABOUT DANIEL GREENFIELD \\\\n\\\\nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam.\" \\\\n\\\\n\"For sure, defence counsel have made much of Taylor\\\\\\'s involvement with the missing and murdered women, all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac, the real killer.

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\"Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE (born 5 July 1963 in Durban, South Africa)[1] was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 2013.[2] â\\\\x80¦ On graduation, he worked for Arthur Andersen.

With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \\\\n\\\\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol (\\\\\\'https\\\\\\' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \\\\n\\\\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \\\\n\\\\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \\\\n\\\\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \\\\n\\\\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \\\\n\\\\nBase One Technologies â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Corporate Strategy â\\\\x80\\\\x93 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \\\\nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

Now, it sems that NASA is making good on his promise and is moving forward with the plan by establishing a Deep-Space Habitat near the Moon to test out systems for people who would live in orbit or travel long distances in Space; a gateway to deep space NASA plans to address its problem by parking a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdeep spaceâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d habitat in a location near the Moon, which astronauts could visit and use to become acclimated to life beyond low-Earth orbit. President Obama mentioned deep space habitats earlier this month, when he reiterated his call for NASA to send humans to Mars. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\\\'m excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Obama said. This wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t really a new announcement, as NASA has been working on the habitat program for a couple of years. Nevertheless, before the president\\\\\\'s mention, this NextSTEP program had received surprisingly little attention given its significanceâ\\\\x80\\\\x94it might be the most important contract NASA awards for next decade. As Obama said, NASA has embarked upon a \"Journey to Mars.\" While the plan may change to include lunar landings as a stepping stone to Mars, the space agency does intend to try and venture back into deep space for the first time since the Apollo program. Whatever destination it chooses, NASA\\\\\\'s ambitions will begin with the deep space habitat, because it is an affordable first step, costing hundreds of millions or a few billion dollars initially, instead of multiple billions needed for a full-blown expedition to the Moon\\\\\\'s surface, Mars or elsewhere in deep space. \"This is the right next step,\" Simon said. \"We need to understand how to live in deep space, how to live off of our planet.\" The first habitat launched in the 2020s wonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t be exactly the same as the vehicle NASA eventually sends to Mars. Rather, it will serve as a prototype to help the space agency understand the capabilities, technologies, and systems needed for astronauts to survive for long periods in deep space. Some of those systems can be tested on the ground or the existing space station, but others can only be tested further from Earth. This venture is part of the Next step program initiated by NASA: www.nasa.gov... NextSTEP is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar spaceâ\\\\x80\\\\x94the space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon.

These are the oligarchs, the â\\\\x80\\\\x9c1%â\\\\x80\\\\x9d whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most American struggle. In her private life Hillary Clinton is well-positioned among this cohort, and they expect her as President to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance. She will.\\\\nTo assure the oligarchs\\' success, the Democratic National Committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process, willfully violating rules, laws, and precedent. The strategy succeeded in the primary elections, and it will win the general.\\\\nWho are these people? The top 1% of wealth-holders numbers about 3.25 million. Predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge American domestic and transnational corporations, either directlyâ\\\\x80\\\\x94executives, directors, investors, contractors, suppliersâ\\\\x80\\\\x94or indirectly in other ways (e.g. investment bankers, hedge fund managers, consultants, top law firms). Two preeminent names in this grouping are Hillary and Bill Clinton, whose net worth (about $125 million) qualifies the couple for the 1% stratum by a factor of 16. Others are Wall Street bankersâ\\\\x80\\\\x94the Clintons\\' primal financial benefactors and first-name friends: Lloyd Blankfein, Jamie Dimon, Robert Rubin, Brian Moynihan, Michael Corbat, James Gorman, Timothy Geithner, John Stumpf, etc. A more accurate description of the â\\\\x80\\\\x9c1%â\\\\x80\\\\x9d would be the corporate elite .\\\\nCandidate Clinton\\'s relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence: she needs their financial and political resources to win the election, and they need her in the White House to sustain their privileged status.\\\\nThis privileged status did not result from accident, random chance, or neglect. It is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward. (Cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy, for example, while exporting 1/3 of the nation\\'s manufacturing jobs.) In the process our democracy was transformed. Public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nation\\'s people, but to create, protect or enhance the financial interests of American corporate enterprise. This is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research. [1]\\\\nMORE... A New Email Investigation on Clinton Could Hasten the Democratic Party\\'s Demise The banana republic of America: Democracy be damned To the Superdelegates: Stand tall in statesmanship! Anointment of Hillary Clinton exposes a democracy that never was Though easily identifiable, the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the American people at large with a preplanned agenda, strategy, and tactics. But they share a common mindset, they are networked by personal acquaintance, and they are driven by a common imperative. Their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of American domestic and foreign policy, both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the group\\'s position of privilege. Alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic, slight, and at the margin.\\\\nInstead of conspiracy, the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary American government, resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption. ( The story of moribund democracy is detailed here .) The economic and political power of mega-corporationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94increasingly fewer but ever largerâ\\\\x80\\\\x94has displaced functional democracy.\\\\n(Yes, we vote as we always have, but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms. The Russian people voted for Vladimir Putin, the Iraqis voted for Saddam Hussein. And voting isn\\'t a prerequisite for democracy to function: the ancient Greeks chose their representatives by lottery.)\\\\nThe priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms.\\\\nPerhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the Executive Branch.\\\\nA new book by political scientists Bastiaan van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff carries a sobering title: American Grand Strategies and Corporate Elite Networks . They looked into the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgrand strategy makers,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the 30 most influential people in cabinet-level and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Bill Clinton\\'s, Bush\\'s, and Obama\\'s. In the Clinton Administration, 25 of the 30 â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgrand strategy makersâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (83%) were linked to 197 different transnational or financial corporations, as executives, directors, senior associates, or partners in law firms, either prior to their public service or after it. In the Bush Administration 27 of the 30 (90%) had connections to 157 corporations. In the Obama Administration 23 of the 30 (over 70%) had such â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctop-level corporate affiliationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d with 111 companies.\\\\nSmoking guns? Examples of wealth-shifting upward to the already rich? Certainly. (1) The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, rammed through in the Bill Clinton Administration by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin from Citigroup. This enabled the subprime loan frenzy, enriching the New York banks but destroying $13 trillion in Americans\\' household wealth. (2) Halliburton\\'s no-bid, obscenely profitable contracts in Iraq, served up by Vice President Richard Cheney during the Bush Administration; billions of taxpayers\\' dollars to the corporation Mr. Cheney once chaired. (3) In the Obama Administration Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner from Wall Street administered the Troubled Asset Relief Program, bailing out his colleagues\\' banks, again with billions of taxpayers\\' money.\\\\nFor the last 24 years the Executive Branch has been dominated by the corporate elite.\\\\nTwo other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar: the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying.\\\\nThe two practices are related in direct proportion: the more you accept in contributions from Boeing, say, the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyist\\'s wishes.\\\\nYour policy-making independence will decrease, then, as the costs of campaigning rise, and contemporary costs are staggering. A Representative today must raise on average $1.7 million in campaign funding, a Senator $10.5 million. A presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions. (Hillary Clinton has taken in $688 million.) Since Citizens United corporate campaign funding has no limits, and with candidates in need of so many millions, the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising.\\\\nUndeniable but easily surmounted. We once had a law on the books (the UK still does) limiting not campaign contributions, but campaign expenditures. The limits were $10,000 for a Senate race, $5,000 for a Representative, sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends. Reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold; intense lobbying might continue, but no Senator, no Representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate. The welfare of the American people could regain priority. The impact on the oligarchs, however, would be apocalyptic.\\\\nThe commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute. By April of 2015 the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut, intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like Hitler\\'s Wehrmacht stormed through Europe. The watch words seemed to be â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfirst and most.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d They amassed an early war-chest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up 400 superdelegate endorsementsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94all before there was a single announced opponent. They invited 65 print and television journalists to meetings in early April, to help in â\\\\x80\\\\x9cframing the HRC message and framing the race.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d [2] Among them were George Stephanoplous and 4 others from ABC; Rachel Maddow and 4 more from MSNBC; Gloria Borger and 7 of her colleagues from CNN; and 5 from the New York Times. Bloomberg, Politico, and CBS each sent along two.\\\\nThe first-and-most strategy worked. Secretary Clinton preempted the candidate space; the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights, especially the wooly socialist from Vermont. But Senator Sanders\\' electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the American people with the status quo . Sanders\\' proposals were anything but cosmetic, slight, and at the margin: they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian, the Clinton campaign. To minimize Sanders\\' exposure, DNC Chair Wasserman-Schultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games. Sanders had to sue to gain access to the DNC\\'s voter database. The deliberate tilting of the Democratic primaries gained momentum.\\\\nTo minimize Sanders\\' exposure, DNC Chair Wasserman-Schultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games.\\\\nThis may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned, but never before has it been so reliably exposed.\\\\nNot by the mainstream media, though. They either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it. From the Iowa caucuses onward, the press treated Clinton\\'s superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes. This continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out. Based on precisely that deception, however, the Associated Press announced Clinton\\'s presumptive nomination on Monday, June 6â\\\\x80\\\\x94one day before primaries were held in California, Montana, New Jersey, North and South Dakota, and the District of Columbia. From Iowa forward also the Washington Post and the New York Times hammered the Sanders campaign without mercy or interruption. (The story was detailed later by Thomas Frank in Harper\\'s Magazine . [3] Frank concludes: I have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year, openly and even gleefully bad-mouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval .)\\\\nNo, the major media failed to expose the fraud, but the social media and the Internet abounded with skepticism. Sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in Iowa; the 70% reduction of polling places in Maricopa County, Arizona; the disqualified Sanders delegates at the Nevada convention; the cheap-shot call by the Associated Press. Many were certain the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were joined at the hip, but there was scant factual evidence.\\\\nEnter Julian Assange and the leaked DNC emails. Now the illegal collusion was documented, the sabotaging of the Sanders campaign exposed. Wasserman-Schultz resigns as DNC chair. Then the Podesta emails and Hillary\\'s paid speeches: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou need both a public position and a private position.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dream is a hemispheric open market, with open trade and open borders.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d DNC vice-chair Donna Brazile, a CNN pundit, emails the Clinton campaign prior to the debate: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The attempt to reschedule the Illinois primary. Another tranche of emails arrives: Brazile\\'s complicity with the Clinton campaign is broadened, she is fired/resigns from her CNN post. The Clinton Foundation hosts pay to play, the Clintons\\' personal enrichment, the $12 million deal with King Mohammed VI of Morocco....\\\\nFinally the compliant mass media did take note: this is, after all, fine spectacle. Noted but not pursued. No determined effort was undertaken to investigate, to document further the deceit and dishonesty, and to assess its magnitude.\\\\nOnce again that was left to the citizenry. The first careful, detailed study was published June 7, 2016 by two scholars, Axel Geijel of Tilburg University and Rodolfo Cortes Barragan at Stanford. It is entitled, Are we witnessing a dishonest election? They compared states who\\'s voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not. Sanders won the paper-trail states, where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered; Clinton overpowered in states without paper trails, where tampering could never be detected. The authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures, and found disturbing discrepancies. They concluded, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c...these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary election. This fraud has overwhelmingly benefited Secretary Clinton at the expense of Senator Sanders.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d (The paper can be found here .)\\\\nThen, with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs, organized as Election Justice USA , published an exhaustive report. The study is entitled, Democracy Lost: A Report on the Fatally Flawed 2016 Democratic Primaries , and it is available here . It details, in 99 pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence, examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories: voter suppression, registration tampering, illegal voter purging, and fraudulent voting machine tallies. In eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error. Every single discrepancy favored Secretary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and no such discrepancies occurred in the Republican counts. The group\\'s conclusion was troubling: 184 elected delegates, their report argues persuasively, were awarded fraudulently to Clinton and denied Sanders, accordingly.\\\\nThat gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention. In the end, however, she needed the additional votes of 163 unelected superdelegates, those empowered by the Democratic National Committee. Even after a primary season documented as fraudulent, then, Hillary Clinton\\'s nomination was achieved by fiat, not democracy.\\\\nBut the corporate elite will not be denied. Given the Clinton/DNC expertise and success in tipping the primary elections, she will be elected President in the general election, guaranteed.\\\\nThe manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible; a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated. The Clinton/DNC people, however, are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit. Scandals were not even acknowledged, defiantly ignored. And the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning, brilliant deception. Hillary Clinton promises to work for Main Street, not Wall Street. She promises to bring back jobs, improve education, seek equal pay for women, boost the minimum wage, expand civil rights, provide free college education, move toward Medicare for all, oppose TPP, break up the too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks. Fine, appealing proposals all, but this is the language of Sanders\\' revolution, and the corporate elite will stand for none of it.\\\\nBut folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly, and the American people are forgiving and trusting. Hillary Clinton is a woman of long experience, and we want to believe our democracy is robust.\\\\nHere, now, we need to be vigilant.\\\\nEndNotes\\\\n[1] See â\\\\x80\\\\x9cTesting Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d by Martin Gillens and Benjamin Page.

Gun trucks provided added firepower. The attackers set up a perimeter, controlling access in and out of the compound. A first wave of attacks sent the Americans fleeing to a fallback building, where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire. \\\\n\\\\nIntelligence reports were still coming in, but officials told The Associated Press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an anti-Islam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation. \\\\n\\\\nIn a country coming off a civil war, a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance. How much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions, officials said. \\\\n\\\\nThe attacks killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, diplomat Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, who US officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials. Stevens was visiting Benghazi from Tripoli to preside over the opening of an â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmerican Spaceâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d cultural center. \\\\n\\\\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports. They stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in Benghazi. FBI agents from New York and Washington were in Libya investigating the attack. \\\\n\\\\n\"What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack,\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. \"And we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans.\" \\\\n\\\\nOfficials have not singled out one responsible group, but have focused their attention on Ansar al-Shariah, a Libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the US military-run prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \\\\n\\\\nSince the civil war that ousted Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi last year, the country has been awash with rebels, militias and terrorists. Weaponry is easy to come by, both from the former regime, from weapons depots looted during the war, and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion. The origin of the weapons used in the assault on the US compound was unclear, officials said.\" \\\\n\\\\n\"Mortar training device with functional simulated propelling charges  \\\\nUS 6059573 A  \\\\nABSTRACT  \\\\nA full-size mortar training device which includes full-size, simulated, propelling charges is disclosed. Both 81 mm and 60 mm mortar training devices are disclosed. The device provides realistic training on virtually all aspects of mortar firing. The device allows training in target sight acquisition and mortar positioning (elevation and azimuth), sight reacquisition due to recoil, dropping a round, adjusting the number of charges, as required, to achieve a desired zone of firing distance, adjusting the projectile fuse setting to control time of explosion, provides realistic firing sound, and allows trainees to follow procedures similar to those used with standard mortar service ammunition. The device includes a cartridge projectile which contacts a pad within and at the lowermost point of the mortar barrel which is not propelled from the mortar barrel and which provides data to a computer system to determine if an area or object would have been impacted by the mortar projectile, provides analysis of trainee firing errors and provides for the simulation to be replayed for trainee instructional and other purposes. The 60 mm device includes a hand-held firing option and the 81 mm device includes a blast attenuator device to further enhance the realism of the simulation.\" \\\\n\\\\n\"Serco Processes 2 Millionth Patent Application for U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Date: 18 Mar 2013 Serco Inc., a leading provider of professional, technology, and management services to the federal government, announced today that their Pre-Grant Publication (PGPubs) Classification Services team recently processed their 2 millionth patent application for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\"Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE (born 5 July 1963 in Durban, South Africa)[1] was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 2013.[2] â\\\\x80¦ On graduation, he worked for Arthur Andersen.

With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \\\\n\\\\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol (\\\\\\'https\\\\\\' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \\\\n\\\\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \\\\n\\\\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \\\\n\\\\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \\\\n\\\\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \\\\n\\\\nBase One Technologies â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Corporate Strategy â\\\\x80\\\\x93 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \\\\nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

The pro-transparency publisher Wikileaks, its founder (and de facto political prisoner) Julian Assange, and anti-secrecy collaborators infuriated the United States establishment with a slew of documents, emails, and graphic exposes like the \" Collateral Murder \" video that demonstrated a US military engaged in war crimes.\\\\nNations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps.

This self-described indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as China and Russia was not about to have its full-spectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers.\\\\nLeaning on its allies, the US enacted a financing squeeze on Wikileaks. Many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by US sanctions, but tiny Wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the Washington schemers.\\\\nIn an attempt to topple Wikileaks, the US establishment has sought to lop off the head of Wikileaks. It has kept close tabs on Julian Assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring Assange down in Sweden: \"We have been warned that the Pentagon, for example, is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us.\"\\\\nIn Sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape. In self-defense Assange spoke to the facts of the situation :\\\\nHere we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric?\\\\n... the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.\\\\nDisinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire.\\\\nWhile in Britain, Assange was eventually placed under house arrest. Sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview Assange in Britain on the allegations. It insisted he come to Sweden, which Assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere, knowing full well that the US Department of Justice was preparing a case against him. Sweden refused to give such an assurance, which speaks strongly about Sweden\\\\\\'s intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens.\\\\nDespite all this intrigue, Wikileaks has continued to publish and Assange has continued to give interviews. Assange did not cower, instead he chose to fight back against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. This is because Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and Wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government.\\\\nClinton and the Democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris. Along the way many outs presented themselves to the Democrats. They could have dropped the grand jury investigation. They could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for Assange\\\\\\'s deportation from Sweden. The US could even have given a presidential pardon to Assange. Extremely telling about the caliber of man that Assange is, is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner, Chelsea Manning.\\\\nBut empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire. Empire does not negotiate deals. It takes what it wants because it believes it can.\\\\nThe result\\\\nThe corruption in the Democratic party has come to light. Wikileaks revealed that the Democratic National Committee conspired against party aspirant Bernie Sanders and heads fell. Clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\\\\nClinton\\\\\\'s emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair John Podesta. Revelations include \"pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations,\" a \" direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East,\" \"Libya, more than anyone else\\\\\\'s war, was Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s war,\" and banks buying cabinet positions.\\\\nThe Clinton campaign has, predictably, been thrown into disarray.\\\\nThe Clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails. Instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere. The Clintonites blamed Russian hacking for interfering in the US presidential race. Finally, Julian Assange felt compelled to state :\\\\nThe Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source.\\\\nNeither is Wikileaks complicit with Russia:\\\\nWe have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.\\\\nGraciously toward Clinton, Assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to \" drone \" him. Imagine what the response would have been if Assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against Clinton.\\\\nPresently, Assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the Clinton campaign for the presidency.\\\\nTrump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he\\\\\\'s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn\\\\\\'t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies... big foreign money ... are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves.\\\\nHowever, a counter coup was announced against the coup by \"Clinton cronyism.\" It is said to include FBI, CIA, military intelligence, other security organizations \"through Julian Assange\" that have promised to stop Clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies.\\\\nA revolution?\\\\nNo matter what transpires on November 8, the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental.

This reluctance to criticize any policies of the Israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the American-Israel Political Action Committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices.\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x94 Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter [1]\\\\nHow the Interviews Came About\\\\nThe Marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society (here referred to as Social Base or just Base) are those of the dominant class (here referred to as System) is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power. Does this tool work in the U.S. model? Certainly, , the relation between the System and its Social Base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies. Because of that sustained regularity, System and Base acted in convergent patterns of dependency. In historical perspective, it was not possible for the System to transform those colonies into states, and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion. From that time onward, an ideological symbiosis ran between the System and the Base. Not only that, but each time the System modifies direction, philosophy, or ideology, the Base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception.\\\\nThe patterns of ideological association between the U.S. System and its Social Base extended into modern times, and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections. If you look at voters\\\\\\' turnout since 1960 , you will notice that a relative-to-large majority of Americans had voted in those elections. My interpretation of the vote in relation to Marx\\\\\\'s thesis is the following. Voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies, crimes around the world, overthrowing foreign governments not in line with Washington, and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing: Voting for that system while knowing its attributes, policies, and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology, culture, and violence.\\\\nMORE... Zionism is Racism Zionism goes from bad to worse, taking Judaism with it How modern is Israel? Green Party of Canada calls to revoke Jewish National Fund charitable status Caveat! That does not necessarily mean that all voters share the System\\\\\\'s imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples. The pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the System\\\\\\'s foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the Base resides in two concepts. Discarding immediately the notion that the Base has been cohabitated by the system, the first concept has it that the Base has given a mandate to the System to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars. A dichotomy sets in here. The System has its way of life, and the Base has its own. The second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism. Meaning, if the System could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars, then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations.\\\\n A question: Would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of \"active sharing\" in the policies of the system? This subject is open for debate . . .\\\\nThe relation between the American System and its Base was uniform up to a certain point in history (late 1920s). Until that point, the American state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status. That uniformity, however, managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged. To be exact, despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the Base and government, as well as the composition of the latter, the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was 1) not open for challenge, and 2) shaped by an exclusive American Anglo-Saxon experience.\\\\nBut when Franklyn D. Roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the Zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a \"Jewish\" state in Palestine, he opened a large crack in the System. That was the first time in U.S. history where the powerful American imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project. With that, a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the U.S. power. The rest is history. As a result, the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the United States coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the U.S. power, the dominant American System itself fell under the domination of one of its social factionsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94American Jewish Zionists.\\\\nWhen Franklyn D. Roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the Zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a \"Jewish\" state in Palestine, he opened a large crack in the System.\\\\nAs a group, American Jewish Zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment. They possess efficient organizational structures, have a monolithic political presence across the American system, and they know how to finance their activities with U.S. tax money. I must note that their alignment with the global agenda of U.S. imperialism is a two-point expedient. The first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of America\\\\\\'s interests. The second is tactical. To reap, on behalf of Israel, the benefits of alignment with slogans such as \"Israel is our only trusted ally in the Middle East\".\\\\nThe American Jewish Zionist experience is agenda driven. As such, their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other Jewish-related consideration.\\\\nOn the domestic front, the focus could not be more evident: to consolidate Zionism and turn it into a means to 1) perpetuate Israel as an American national issue, and 2) make of them the principal factor in defining American politics. You can notice the endeavor clearly during U.S. elections when the Zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the Jews, and for Israel. Today, voicing dissent against the policies of American Jewish Zionism or criticizing Israel amounts to crime. Jimmy Carter experienced this firsthand. When he published his book: Palestine: Peace not Apartheid , American Jewish Zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him.\\\\nAs for the Jewish Zionist foreign agenda, this is clear-cut and leaves no space for misunderstanding. It aims to induce, control, or lead the United States to 1) adopt hostile policies toward the Arab nations because due to their rejection of the Zionist state, and 2) undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to Israel. Equally important, it demands that the United States keep denying the Palestinians rights for nationhood through American diplomacy. What is the rationale? Recognition of the Palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the Zionist state and its claim on Palestine.\\\\nBecause the Jewish Zionist control of the U.S. System is real and dominant, how does the American society figure vis-Ã\\\\xa0-vis this dominance? Based on observations of the American society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns, there can be but one answer: Zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the American people. It is, however, the dominant culture and ideology of the U.S. political system.\\\\nOBSERVATIONS\\\\nFirst, despite gargantuan Zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the American people, Jewish Zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for Zionist issues and for Israel,\\\\nSecond, due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues, a majority of Americans have only vague ideas on what Zionism is,\\\\nThird, to establish roots for their political dominance, Jewish Zionist activists invariably focus not on the American people, but on ways to control the American system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter: White House and Congress.\\\\nFourth, this control did not happen because of elections. It is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing Jewish Zionists to important positions inside the administrations,\\\\nFifth, among the stratagems employed by Zionists when they run for elective offices, one was particularly effective: Take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election. To do that, Jewish Zionist candidates rarely, if ever, talk about Israel or Zionism. Instead, they only debate matters of interest to the voters. Once elected though, promoting Israel via American legislations becomes the top hidden agenda,\\\\nSixth, and to conclude this particular argument, the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of Jewish Zionists (thus indirectly to Israel) in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and cultureâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Zionism.\\\\nAnother point to discuss is the expansion of the Jewish Zionist power. By all accounts, such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process. In his book, The Arabists: The Romance of an American Elite , Robert D. Kaplan defined the issue that I framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy. Kaplan was unambiguous. He called these new elites by their names: Irish-Americans and Jewish-Americans.\\\\nKaplan\\\\\\'s viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion. He argued that the old elites approached the U.S.-Arab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog, all while keeping an eye on the U.S. imperialist interests. His argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion. The two groups of post-WWII American society that Kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of U.S. foreign policy. (It is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward Arabs and Muslimsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94each for his own set of religious, political, and ideological rationales.). As for the successive shares of African-Americans and Hispanics in the making of the national policy of the United States, this is another argument.\\\\nAs a witness to history, in early 2012, I began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of American Jewish Zionists in the making of U.S. policies and wars in the Arab world. In May of that year, as my work became broad in scope, I decided to seek more views on the subject. I came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where I pose the same questions. While some of the prospective interviewees declined, and others accepted but then withdrew, three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge, scholarship, and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views.\\\\nThey are Francis Boyle, a professor of international law, University of Illinois, College of Law; James Petras, a professor emeritus, University of Binghamton, New York; Canadian writer and former co-editor of the online publication of Dissident Voice Kim Petersen. Professors Boyle and Petras answered my questions via phone conversations, and, Petersen via email correspondence.\\\\nHowever, in the weeks following the interviews, my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing. In short, I was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned. Today, as I thank Prof. Francis Boyle, Prof. James Petras, and Kim Petersen for sharing their invaluable insight, I apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read.\\\\nINTRODUCTION\\\\nThe turning point in the emergence of Jewish Zionism as a dominant American political force came about when Iraq invaded Kuwait. (Discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction.) The Jewish Zionist establishment seized the occasion, mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives, and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against Iraq. To bring their war mania to fruition, they unleashed their \"experts\" in all directions. They talked about Iraq\\\\\\'s \"formidable\" military capabilities and about Saddam\\\\\\'s one-million-man standing army ready to invade Saudi Arabia and seize its oil. They told stories about Saddam Hussein\\\\\\'s personal life, his bunkers, and his mortal \"nuclear threats\" to Israel. And they talked about Iraq\\\\\\'s threats to U.S. interests and \"allies\" in the Middle East. . . . Here is a brief account of those events.\\\\nOn July 25, 1990, Iraqi president Saddam Hussein met with U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. It is on record that Glaspie gave Hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve Iraq\\\\\\'s problems with Kuwait militarily. On August 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait. On August 3, George H. W. Bush ordered the freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets and immediately placed Iraq under hermetic embargo. Considering the prompt, extraordinary anti-Iraq measures that the United States took in the first 24 hours of that invasion, one wonders what was pushing the U.S. to move so quickly on Iraq knowing that only two days earlier, this was conducting a U.S. proxy against Iran. The observation that the U.S. did not take similar actions when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, or when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 raises many questions. What were the U.S. rationales in taking such measures? Who conceived them? Did the U.S. entrap Iraq? Why? . . .\\\\nThe atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic. Like a lightning bolt, U.S. imperialist and Zionist forces instantly mobilized their media, talking heads, retired generals, and bogus experts on the Middle East. The deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by Iraq in Kuwait hid a definite scheme: Incite for war . In the period August 2, 1990 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 January 14, 1991, Israelis and Jewish Zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the Bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war. On January 15, 1991, a 30-member \"coalition\" in which the U.S. had the lion shareâ\\\\x80\\\\x94ninety-seven percent of the total forceâ\\\\x80\\\\x94attacked Iraq. By every standard and minutia of details, the war on Iraq in 1991 was an American War .\\\\nAt the end of a war that destroyed one of Israel\\\\\\'s Arab adversaries, George H. W. Bush might have thought of himself as America\\\\\\'s \"laureate hero\". He did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the U.S. loan guaranties to Israel, would have unleashed the Jewish Zionist establishment against him. The fact that he lost to Bill Clinton (who opposed Bush\\\\\\'s freeze, and who stated that Israel was the \"only country that paid back its debts\") indicated that American Jewish Zionists had finally reached their objective: To perfect ways to control the U.S. politics from the inside . In retrospect, it can be said that George H. W. Bush was the last non-Zionist American president. From Bill Clinton forward, U.S. presidents and their vice president became pawns in the Jewish Zionist play of power.\\\\nNow, as the United States was preparing for war with Iraq to \"liberate\" Kuwait, thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it. But no one could have ever beaten Patrick J. Buchanan\\\\\\'s memorable words about how American Jewish Zionists and Israel were pushing for that war. He said, \\\\\\'\\\\\\'There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner .\\\\\\'\\\\\\' [2] With that, Buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head. A.M. Rosenthal, a ringleader of U.S. Zionist journalism could not bear what he heard. In a rebuttal, he unleashed an acerbic attack against Buchanan. His weapon of argument, so to speak, was the stale and trite accusation of \"antisemitism\".\\\\nWhining, Rosenthal twisted Buchanan\\\\\\'s clear words and went on to imply that Buchanan was in effect engaging in an \"anti-Jewish\" tirade. He re-interpreted Buchanan\\\\\\'s words and cast them in a standard Zionistic fashion. He wrote that Buchanan\\\\\\'s intention was \\\\\\'\\\\\\'The Jews are trying to drag us into war. Only Jews want war. Israeli Jews want war to save Israel\\\\\\'s hide. American Jews who talk of military action against Iraq want war because it would suit Israeli interests. They are willing to spill American blood for Israeli interests.\" [3]\\\\nBy inserting the word, \"Jew\" in his reply, Rosenthal and the New York Times behind him spat on the face of U.S. political reality under the tight grip of Zionism. We need not waste our breath on Rosenthal\\\\\\'s petty tactic. His clear objective was to distract from the central issue, which is, Buchanan\\\\\\'s opposition to the planned war against Iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it. Rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity.\\\\nStill, Buchanan was honest. He pointed the finger to Israel and its \"Amen corner\" because that was the truth. The fact that most Israelis and \"Amen corners\" happened to be of Jewish faith was nonissue. To conclude, it is evident that Buchanan, a dreamer of an American \"republic\" not \"empire\", could not stand by idle while seeing the United States sheepishly fastened to the yoke of Zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state, Israel.\\\\nBuchanan did not stop there. Truthful and resolute, he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the U.S. Congress vis-Ã\\\\xa0-vis Israel and American Jewish Zionists. He dubbed it as \"An Israeli-occupied territory\" [4]. Buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly American politicians would dare not think, let alone say. Notice that Buchanan had placed Israel before its U.S. \"amen corner\". I view this as a statement. He clearly implied that Israel is the primary decision maker. Did that also imply that U.S. Zionist groups (amen corner) are puppets moved by Israel? Most likely, if so, which has more power in setting the U.S. world agenda and policies: Israel or American Jewish Zionists? Dialectically, the answer should be Israel by means of its \"amen corner\\\\\\'.\\\\nNow, in December 1991, Jim Lehrer (a former co-anchor of The Macneil/Lehrer NewsHour, and later sole anchor of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer ) interviewed Pat Buchanan. It is important to mention, that Jim Lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over 30 years starting in 1975. Is that an issue? Yes, and to debate it, the following applies. Whenever a specific group of people, be they Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheist, duopoly party apparatchiks, etc., keeps an important public post for such a long duration, the implication is unescapable: the group controls that post because of its embedded importance. . . . But more important, they have the power to keep it.\\\\nNonetheless, when a specific group continues to hold, throughout time, important positions inside public corporations, agencies, and branches of the U.S. government, a paradigm emerges. Either the group controls said corporations directlyâ\\\\x80\\\\x94that is why it is able to do what they want. Or, it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees. At any rate, considering this type of control, the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable.\\\\nAdditionally, the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect. It means that someone within the context of U.S. imperialism has decided that the U.S. public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns. In these patterns, issues such as Israel, Zionism, Palestine, U.S. imperialism in the Middle East, wars, etc., are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter.\\\\nBefore continuing, I must state that Lehrer\\\\\\'s political views are not a subject to discuss vis-Ã\\\\xa0-vis his program. For one, the NewsHour program is not about the personal views of presentersâ\\\\x80\\\\x94it is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation. Second, whether Lehrer had sympathies for Israel or Zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them. Nevertheless, a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated news/comments, the people who deliver them, and the people who hear them.\\\\nFirstly, planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination. Psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses. To be sure, these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries. Still, the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict. They also know they can seep to the viewers pre-conceived ideas through pleasant dialogs, affable manners, appearance of neutrality, and clever circumlocutions.\\\\nTo be fair to Lehrer, he was consistent in making intelligent questions. However, he was also consistent at doing something else. He would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed. It is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the Zionist and imperialist discourse. In essence, a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation.\\\\nNow, in his interview, Lehrer played dumb when he asked Buchanan about his bold characterization of the Congress. He phrased his question as follows, \"You have also said that Congress is an Israeli-occupied territory. Now, what do you mean by that ?\" [Italics are mine]\\\\nCOMMENT: Semantically as much as politically, Buchanan\\\\\\'s figure of speech was terse and unequivocal. He plainly meant that the Congress observes Israel\\\\\\'s agenda and acts accordingly. There was no need for Buchanan to say anything further because what he said had (and still has) basis in verifiable facts. With a question such as, \"what do you mean by that\" Lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from Buchanan. The form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap Buchanan, make him retract, or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency. In essence, Lehrer had simply tried to deny that Israel controls the Congress through its \"amen corner\" because his \"what do you mean\" indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation. [5]\\\\nTo wrap up the issue, without exclusion, any denial of the Jewish Zionist control of the United States is a farce. Take Abraham H. Foxman of the infamous Anti-Defamation League as an example. Foxman authored a masterâ\\\\x80\\\\x91deceptive propaganda book that he called, \" The Deadliest Lies : The Israeli Lobby and the Myth of Jewish Control. [Italics are mine]. First, Foxman lied. He knew very well that the Jewish [Zionist] control is not a myth but a pervasive reality. Second, but most important, the problem is not the abstract \"Jewish control\" but the specificâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Jewish Zionist control. This can be explained using a current universal truth: hundreds of thousands of Jews from all nationalities actively oppose Zionism on political, religious, ethical, historical, and ideological grounds.\\\\nFoxman\\\\\\'s denial means one of two things. Either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of American Jewish Zionism, or he is very ignorant of the history of Zionism , which is impossible. Either way, Foxman\\\\\\'s business is propaganda, demagogy, and deception. Incidentally, Foxman\\\\\\'s denial looks very similar to what some Arabs do in the Middle East. Villagersâ\\\\x80\\\\x94but even some city folksâ\\\\x80\\\\x94try to fend off \"envy\" by following an eon-old superstition. They fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center. It appears that Foxman and his associates have their own superstition. By decrying the \"deadliest lies\" against American Jewish Zionists, they try to fend off the accusation or the \"envy\" that Jewsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94specifically, Jewish Zionistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94have power and influence.\\\\nOf substance, did Foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what John Foster Dulles told William Knowland (a pro-Zionist senator from California) back in February 1957? In an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get Israel out of Egyptian territory occupied by Israel in the Suez War, Dulles pronounced these prophetic words, \"We cannot have all our policies made in Jerusalem . . .\" [6]. That was in 1957. Today, all those who deride or deny the charge that Israel has a say on U.S. foreign policy and wars in the Middle East must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying.\\\\nInterestingly, years after Buchanan made that statement, the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity. Two people vindicated his characterization of Capitol Hills as an Israeli-occupied territory\" and both used his words to make the point. The first is a former CIA officer Philip Giraldi, and the second is Philip Weiss, founder of MondoWeiss Website. In an article he wrote in 2011, Giraldi pointed to the Congress as, \" Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Still Occupied Territory \". Weiss titled a piece he wrote in 2015 as such: \" Capitol Hill â\\\\x80\\\\x94 still Israeli-occupied territory \".\\\\nAt this point, do American Jewish Zionists control the United States? Do they control it as polity or only the political system? Do they have real influence in setting U.S. foreign policy and wars against the Arab and Muslim nations? Or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations?\\\\nNEXT\\\\nPart 2: Discussion\\\\nPart 3: Interview with Francis Boyle\\\\nPart 4: Interview with James Petras\\\\nPart 5: Interview with Kim Petersen\\\\nNOTES\\\\nJimmy carter, Speaking frankly about Israel and Palestine , Los Angeles Times, 8 December 2006 Pat Buchanan, The McLaughlin Group, Aug 26, 1990, Quote: d in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, What They Said: Israel and Its \"Amen Corner\" , February 1992 ON MY MIND; Forgive Them Not , The New York Times, 14 September 1990 Quote: d in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, Is Congress an Israeli-Occupied Territory ?, July 1995 The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, What They Said: Israel and Its \"Amen Corner\" , Feb. 1992 David Tal, editor, The 1956 War: Collusion and Rivalry in the Middle East, Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, p. 40\\'\\n \\'64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) \\\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â\\\\x80\\\\x94 Following the results of Tuesday nightâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Obama told reporters. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nUnder the Presidentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. \\\\nNot surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s decision. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t allow that to happen. President Obama doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nPaul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their statesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nPolitical Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9c[The electoral college] is a fâ\\\\x80\\\\x94king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nObama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Obama said. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Obama said. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIf you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administrationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s special election hotline at (785) 273-0325. TAGS \\'\\n \\'Red State : \\\\nFox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cre-openedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d) the investigation into Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: \\\\nAnd the news is breaking while weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. \\\\nTargets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weinerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s well-known penchant for lying, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and, as Wallace indicated on this morningâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. Weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see if Weinerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s cooperation extends beyond that.

In a country like Pakistan, which is far behind Canada in term of education, research and scholarship, no teacher, or non-teacher, of any university can be suspended without pay. When someone is suspended, he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension. If Canada is doing better than us on various scales, then one would expect that suspension without pay puts Canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play. I may add respectfully that in Pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing. The decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment.\\\\n From his writings, that I have read over a period of time, it is evident that Professor Anthony Hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state. His analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly. And his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation. , or any university for that matter, should have been proud to have Professor Hall on its faculty. His suspension creates an impression, even from this distance from where I write, that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech, have targeted people like Professor Anthony Hall, who speak out for democracy, decency, peace and justice.\\\\nI have found out from the internet that Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech. It is quite evident that the charge that Professor Anthony Hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious. To the contrary, it appears that an anti-Muslim bias has been created in your institution by Professor Hallâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s unfortunate suspension.There is also a strong impression that Bâ\\\\x80\\\\x99nai Brith has taken over the administrative decision making at Lethbridge.\\\\nMORE...

When I was a young student at University of Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1970s, I used to meet many Canadian students and I found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice. The suspension of Professor Hall is inconsistent with my image of the Canadian people that I had then formed.\\\\nOn behalf of the academic community of the University of the Punjab (established 1882) I urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend Professor Hall.

Trump today, Trump would have beaten himâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nItâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy to glance at Tuesdayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s popular vote â\\\\x80\\\\x94 which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states â\\\\x80\\\\x94 Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin â\\\\x80\\\\x94 Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s more, she far surpassed Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s 2012 vote total in Florida, the countryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. \\\\nA review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the countryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s most critical battleground states.

The US State Department records that in Saudi Arabia its â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccitizens lack the right and legal means to change their governmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d while there are â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women . . .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d, but Washington takes no action to encourage the Saudi monarchy to relax or even modify its domestic tyranny.\\\\nSaudi Arabia is a valued ally of the United States and indulges in â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctorture and other abuses [and] arbitrary arrest and detention,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d while â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfreedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d It might be imagined that the President of the United States might feel it proper to indicate his disapproval of the fact that in Saudi Arabia â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccivil law does not protect human rights, including freedom of the speech and of the press.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x94 but no US president will ever do anything to discourage the Saudi monarchy from continuing its domestic tyranny and murder of so many innocents in Yemen.\\\\nDonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think that, with Hillary Clinton President of the USA, weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a total war, knowing that she is supported by the neocons and the military-industrial complex?\\\\nUnder a Clinton administration there would have been no cessation of US havoc-wreaking wars around the world, and desperate refugees would have died in their thousands. Her regime would have ensured that the Pentagonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s fleets continue to go down to the seas in confrontation, and the bombers would have streaked across the skies, deliberately provoking China and Russia. Remember that she is one of the Washington-Brussels war-drum beaters who planned the 2011 aerial blitz on Libya to destroy the government of President Gaddafi, about whose murder she giggled that â\\\\x80\\\\x9c We came; We saw; He died. â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The US-NATO attacks on Libya caused massive suffering and destruction, opened the way for feuding bands of militants to fight each other for control of parts of the country, and created a haven for the lunatic extremists of Islamic State [aka ISIS].\\\\nHillary Clinton has not criticised or questioned Obamaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s years of aerial bombardment around the world and her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, told Londonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Daily Telegraph that she would order a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfull reviewâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of US strategy on Syria as a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfirst key taskâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of her presidency, resetting the policy to emphasise the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmurderousâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d nature of the government. He said that Mrs. Clinton would work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cout of there.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPresident Assad has been selected as another target for the Clinton policy of â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe came; We Saw; He died,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and his country appears doomed to a rerun of the Libya fiasco.\\\\nIf Hillary Clinton had become President of the United States, as seemed only too likely, there would have been even greater emphasis on global airstrikes and military confrontation. Greater turmoil, chaos and catastrophe were to come.\\\\nSeveral reports mention deliveries of Western arms to groups activated in Syria, weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups, such as ISIS-Daesh and al-Nusra. How do you explain the miscalculation of governments that have delivered weapons to terrorists to find these weapons turned against them, as we have seen in various attacks on European soil?\\\\nThe US supplies weapons to many rebels and insurrectionists around the world. One of the most absurd of these supply chains was in the 1980s when they gave hundreds of Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, then had to buy them back for half a million dollars each when it was realised that the Mujahideen were about to use them against civilian airliners. The British have also supplied ground-to-air missiles to insurrectionists groups, with much less publicity but on occasions with serious results. The only explanation for the motives of western governments in doing this sort of thing is that they are poorly informed by their vastly expensive intelligence agencies.\\\\nThe Americans destroyed Iraq with their ally Tony Blair, Sarkozy made the same thing in Libya with David Cameron, how do you explain that these personalities are not judged, in particular via ICC, authority which judges only African despots?\\\\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) â\\\\x80\\\\x9cinvestigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d But the United States â\\\\x80\\\\x9cis not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Courtâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and although Britain and France are in theory supportive of the ICC, there will never â\\\\x80\\\\x94 ever â\\\\x80\\\\x94 be a political leader of these countries arraigned before the Court for war crimes or anything else. The African despots it judges are no doubt guilty of heinous crimes, but they are also easy to arraign.\\\\nHow do you explain that Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s candidacy was maintained while she does not stop making headlines with multiple scandals?\\\\nBecause the Democrat Party desperately wanted a Democrat president. Members of the Party was prepared to hold their noses with one hand to keep out the stink of Hillaryâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s scandals while with the other hand pressing the button to Vote Hillary.\\\\nIn your opinion, why do Western Governments continue to support old leaders and despotic regimes and to destabilize others according to their interests under the pretext of \"human rights\", \"democracy\", etc.? Who gave them this right?\\\\nNobody gave them the right to support or destroy any government, anywhere, but Western politicians and generals continues to believe that, as in the old colonial days, they have a mission to alter the lives of those they consider inferior. There is flexibility in this policy, however, because if dictators are important for the economies of the West, they are permitted to torture detainees, treat women as chattels, forbid freedom of religion and imprison critics.\\\\nSome of our European intelligence sources tell us that there was a mass movement of Daesh towards some countries of Northern Europe, result of the offensive on Daesh in Syria and Iraq. How do you explain that such redeployment towards Europe is possible with all the risks of attack that entails? Donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think that the coordination between European intelligence fails?\\\\nI do not believe that there has been mass movement of Daesh/IS adherents to northern Europe.\\\\nLibya is a terrorist sanctuary a few kilometers away from Europe. You have an experience in both military and diplomatic, how do you see the resolution of the Libyan equation, is a crisis that can only be resolved militarily or is the policy which should prevail?\\\\nUnlike in Saudi Arabia, for example, in Gaddafiâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s prosperous Libya there was freedom of religion and women were regarded as human beings. The entire population received free education and medical care. Then the country was reduced to anarchy by the US-NATO aerial blitz of March-October 2011 (Germany refused to join in), during which, among other devastation, water and oil pipelines and pumping stations were deliberately destroyed. Militia bands took over various parts of the country and continue to fight against each other, while extremist Islamic [Wahhabi] groups have grown in size and influence and the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGovernment of National Accordâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is powerless.\\\\nMany of those who energetically supported the war, such as the former secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continue to claim that it was a success â\\\\x80\\\\x94 â\\\\x80\\\\x9ca model interventionâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x94 and that it is the fault of â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe international communityâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that the country is a shambles. But even US President Obama admitted that the war on Libya â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdidnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t workâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and that failure to have a plan for the future of the country after the murder of President Gaddafi was â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe worst mistakeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of his presidency.\\\\nGiven that the Obama presidency is in its last months, it is unlikely he will order an invasion of Libya to try to eradicate the Islamic [aka Takfiri] terrorists and rebuild the country he and his allies destroyed. He and his supporters in Europe, notably France and Britain, will continue clandestine ground operations, drone attacks and conventional airstrikes to try to assassinate extremist leaders and destroy their gangs, but these will fail. It is difficult to predict the future in Libya, other than to say that it is most likely that its people will continue suffering the appalling effects of the US-NATO war, and that there will be no peaceful resolution of its problems.\\\\nIs the era of the American domination a fatality? Doesn \\\\\\' t humanity may find it beneficial to see the emergence of a multipolar world ?\\\\nIt should be remembered that in an August 2014 interview with the New York Times President Obama said â\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi [emphasis added] in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The name of the game is regime change, but America, the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cindispensable nationâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d has failed in its military adventures all over the world and has created widening instability which in turn has led to growth in extremism and terrorism. Unipolarity, with the US possessing and exercising most military power, has not worked.\\\\nIt appears that multipolarity might be a better alternative, with other nations restraining Washington from unilateral intervention aimed at overthrowing governments, but it is apparent that the US is determined to do all it can to prevent interference in its world domination strategies. In consequence it has engaged in a deliberate policy of confrontation with China and Russia that is entirely counter-productive and could well lead to war. Multipolarity would probably benefit humanity, but that is irrelevant to the indispensable nation.\\\\nWhat do you think of the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the victory of Donald Trump?\\\\nMr. Trump has not elucidated a foreign policy as such, and we can only hope that he will build on the positive indications he has given about America ceasing to meddle militarily all round the world. His greatest achievement would be engage in positive discussions with Russia and China, which would result in vastly diminished tension in east and west. The defeat of Clinton has meant that the threat of US international confrontation has at least diminished, because the world would have been a very dangerous place if she had got in to the White House.\\\\nInterview realized by Mohsen Abdelmoumen\\\\nWho is Brian Cloughley?\\\\nBrian Cloughley is a British and Australian armiesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 veteran, former deputy head of the UN military mission in Kashmir and Australian defense attachÃ© in Pakistan.\\\\nHe studied South Asian affairs for forty years and is South Asia defense analyst for IHS/Jane\\\\\\'s Sentinel, covering Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, updating material regularly.

Gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the Foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s practices. \\\\nBelow are key quotes from Gibsonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s findings. Keep in mind that the Clinton Foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s very existence depends on it being legally certified as a non-profit entity, in compliance with laws governing non-profits. Break those laws and its non-profit status would be revoked, and the whole operation would go down the drain. \\\\nGibson: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cImportant responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the [Foundation] CFO, who appears to delegate them to an outside organization, with very little oversight by the legal department. As a result, the Foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules, including in New York, which requires the Foundation to be certified to do business in the State.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d [Apparently, the Clinton Foundation was not legally registered as a non-profit in New York.] \\\\nGibson: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo matter what the leadership decides about the larger, over-arching question, it must act immediately to bring the Foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern not-for-profits, and must create strong legal and HR offices so to prevent any lapses in the future.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nGibson: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Foundation does not have a record retention policy[!], and the procedures currently utilized in Harlem [headquarters] may violate the law.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nZero Hedge writes: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cFurthermore, and more troubling, the [Gibson] review pointed to a high-ranking but unnamed foundation executive who was â\\\\x80\\\\x98being paid by [President Clinton], the government and the foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 who â\\\\x80\\\\x98allowed the foundation to host what may have been (or may have been viewed as) a political event, apparently without official pre-approval from the foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s legal department and without regard, before the fact, to the impact of that decision on the foundationâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s tax exempt status.â\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThis memo was written in 2008. It would have taken then, and it would now take, about a month of investigation by New York State and US Dept. of Justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the Clinton Foundation. \\\\nThat didnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen then. Will it happen now? Not if the Dept. of Justice has anything to say about it. The Clintons are protected. \\\\nBut evidence of the Foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire.

They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. \\\\nAccording to the Huffington Post , \\\\nStoneâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake â\\\\x80\\\\x9cexit polls,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his groupâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. \\\\nIn fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbad ideaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cordered them taken down.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nCampaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cItâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIndeed, but thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. \\\\nAs it turns out, heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s right about the election being rigged, only itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. \\\\nEarlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cUWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSo not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. \\\\nAnd that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it. \\\\nFeatured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Share this Article! \\'\\n \\'Curious, Letita, what specifically causes you such angst?

Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. \\\\nThe faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place â\\\\x80\\\\x93 much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year â\\\\x80\\\\x93 so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup dâ\\\\x80\\\\x99etat in the Ukraine , to NATOâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EUâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x98migrant crisisâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the â\\\\x80\\\\x98 White Helmetsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 in Syria â\\\\x80\\\\x93 these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history â\\\\x80\\\\x93 an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. \\\\nWe tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT Internationalâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\n. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to â\\\\x80\\\\x9crespond to information warfare by Russia.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctoolsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of â\\\\x80\\\\x9chostile propaganda.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe EU Parliamentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s resolution demonstrates â\\\\x80\\\\x9c political degradation â\\\\x80\\\\x9d in regard to the â\\\\x80\\\\x9c idea of democracy â\\\\x80\\\\x9d in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. \\\\nPutin pointed out that while â\\\\x80\\\\x9c everyone tries to lecture â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, â\\\\x80\\\\x9c which is not the best way â\\\\x80\\\\x9d to deal with any issues. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9c The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support oneâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s point of view should be presented ,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Putin said. \\\\nAdding that he hopes the Western move to â\\\\x80\\\\x9c counter Russian propaganda â\\\\x80\\\\x9d wonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. \\\\nIn the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report â\\\\x80\\\\x98 EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties â\\\\x80\\\\x99, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. \\\\nWritten by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to â\\\\x80\\\\x9c distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. \\\\nAt the same time, Russia is accused of â\\\\x80\\\\x9c information warfare ,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctools. â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). \\\\nThe report also mentions some â\\\\x80\\\\x9c social media and internet trolls â\\\\x80\\\\x9d from Russia who are thought to â\\\\x80\\\\x9c challenge democratic values .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIt called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of â\\\\x80\\\\x9c investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO â\\\\x80\\\\x9c on strategic communication .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9c The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EUâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s own human rights and freedom of press norms,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. \\\\nDuring the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was â\\\\x80\\\\x9c at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d and that with an alleged â\\\\x80\\\\x9c aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\'\\n \\'By John Vibes \\\\nIn the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. \\\\nNATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. \\\\nIt was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s border. \\\\nOn Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s borders as part of a huge military deployment. \\\\nA total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s borders since the Cold War. \\\\nIn addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. \\\\nThe US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdeterrentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday â\\\\x80\\\\x94 ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. \\\\nJust imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to â\\\\x80\\\\x98prevent conflict.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\nThe so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. \\\\nThe United Statesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATOâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone elseâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s lands. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s) security posture,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Lute said. \\\\nIf anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. \\\\nThese military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. \\\\nUntil now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today. \\\\nJohn Vibes is an author and researcher who organizes a number of large events including the Free Your Mind Conference.

The Chinese negotiators added that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cany movement by the new US governmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy.\\\\nChina worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France\\\\\\'s capital.\\\\nBy contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama\\\\\\'s measures to combat climate change.\\\\nMORE... Canadian Big Media ignoring responsibility by failing to cover climate change crisis Petition calls for DOJ investigation into ExxonMobil\\\\\\'s denial of climate science Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and a senior Chinese climate talks negotiator, told Reuters that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris agreement, \"China\\\\\\'s influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase China\\\\\\'s global standing, power and leadership.\"\\\\nChina is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing South-South partnership, particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change.\\\\nChina is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change, a gesture that has received wide welcome.\\\\nSpeaking to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Climate Change Conference (COP22) President Salaheddine Mezouar said that China has an â\\\\x80\\\\x9cextremely important role to play in accompanying, reinforcing and boosting South-South partnership and support sustainable development policies in the African continentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d.\\\\nXie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22), said on Nov. 7 that China has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climate-resilient. \"We will help build up ten low-carbon pilot zones, launch 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and offer training programs for 1,000 climate-related professionals,\" he said.\\\\nWhat Xie called the \"10-100-1000\" project is part of the effort that China has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change. The country has earmarked a total of 580 million yuan (about US$85 million) since 2011 to help developing countries, according to Zhang Yucheng, deputy director of the International Cooperation Division of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).\\\\nThe most recent offer is the South-South Climate Cooperation Fund, a US$3.1 billion fund pledged by Chinese President Xi Jinping last September to help developing countries address climate issues.\\'\\n \\'BREAKING! NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Caseâ\\\\x80¦Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Timesâ\\\\x80¦Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince \\\\nPrince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s email server last week. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince claimed. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, â\\\\x80\\\\x98Weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to go public with this if you donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t reopen the investigation and you donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t do the right thing with timely indictments,â\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince explained. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe â\\\\x80\\\\x93 I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. Thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince said. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince declared. \\\\nMarlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince elaborated. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years â\\\\x80\\\\x93 have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have â\\\\x80\\\\x93 they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clintonâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince contended. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he stated. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs â\\\\x80\\\\x93 thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the level just below commissioner â\\\\x80\\\\x93 he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince said. \\\\nHe noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut they canâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t convene a grand jury. They canâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t file charges.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nMarlow agreed that Bhararaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9csterling reputationâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d as a determined prosecutor was â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbad news for the Clintons.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nPrince agreed, but said, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf people are willing to bend or break the law and donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t really care about the Constitution or due process â\\\\x80\\\\x93 if youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone â\\\\x80\\\\x93 who knows what level of pressureâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? \\\\nListen to interview here: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe point being, fortunately, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has â\\\\x80\\\\x9cexposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Departmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to â\\\\x80\\\\x9ckeep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he warned. \\\\nAs for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cde Blasio wants to stay away from this.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\nFor entire story: Breitbart News 14.7K shares \\'\\n \\'\\\\n21st Century Wire saysâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nOver the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that â\\\\x80\\\\x9c Russia is Hacking the US Election â\\\\x80\\\\x9dâ\\\\x80\\\\x93 blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly â\\\\x80\\\\x98hackingâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. \\\\nIt goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Partyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. \\\\nTodayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. \\\\nWith such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forwardâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nIn a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each otherâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. \\\\nPutin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. \\\\nThe Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some â\\\\x80\\\\x9cburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d RIA Novosti reported. \\\\nOn top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each otherâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAccording to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s relations with the US â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwas not our choice,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d however. \\\\nFor things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Putin said at an economic forum in Moscowâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\\\nSUPPORT 21WIRE â\\\\x80\\\\x93 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \\'\\n \"a reply to: windword Shall I post videos of Hillary laughing at death and mayhem?

(It) hit at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) between Perugia and Macerata, according to ANSA. The second quake -- with a magnitude of 6.1 -- was 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) north of Visso and 58 km (36 miles) from Perugia, the USGS reported. The depth of both is 10 km. There have been 2 aftershocks, 4.1 and 4.9, also at a depth of 10 KM. \"We don\\\\\\'t have any reported victims, but we\\\\\\'re in the dark and under a downpour,\" said Mauro Falcucci, the mayor of the small town of Castelsantangelo sul Nera, according to state news agency ANSA.

Their visa records vanished from Chicago\\\\\\'s Indian consulate. It comes one week after the ABC 7 I-Team raised questions about how David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place. \\\\n\\\\nThe case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from Mumbai to Michigan Avenue. India\\\\\\'s foreign secretary Nirupama Rao told reporters overseas Wednesday that she wants answers from Chicago\\\\\\'s Indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared, records that might show how two accused Chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in India. \\\\n\\\\nTop officials of Chicago\\\\\\'s India consulate wouldn\\\\\\'t talk to the I-Team on camera last week when asked how terror suspects David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained five-year, unlimited passage visas to India. \\\\n\\\\nAnd the consul general did not return calls Wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process Headley and Rana\\\\\\'s visas, which Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao announced Wednesday have disappeared. \\\\n\\\\nWednesday evening, the Chicago consul general emailed a statement to the I-Team that conflicted with government statements made in India. The brief statement read: \"We have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana Hussain. Relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the Government of India\". \\\\n\\\\nIndia\\\\\\'s counterpart to the FBI is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the 2008 Mumbai massacre. \\\\n\\\\nThe two Chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault. Rana was denied bond by a Chicago district judge Tuesday, despite family members and friends offering $1 million in cash and property. Rana has not been directly charged with the Mumbai attack that left 175 dead, but was linked to the assault in government court filings. \\\\n\\\\nHeadley, a Pakistan-born Chicagoan, is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was Daood Giliani. He changed his name to ease travel to India, according to federal prosecutors in Chicago and to avoid the required pre-visa background check by Indian authorities. \\\\n\\\\nSince the time Headley and Rani were processed, India\\\\\\'s Chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called Travisa Outsourcing that on its website claims, \"We have revolutionized the way people get their visas.\" \\\\n\\\\nAnd the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year. \\\\n\\\\n\"The advantages of outsourcing is the Travisa company, which is handling the outsourcing, has set up a call center,\" said Ashok Kumar Attri, consul general. \\\\n\\\\nForeign Secretary Rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the US has given to Indian investigators.

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\"Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE (born 5 July 1963 in Durban, South Africa)[1] was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 2013.[2] â\\\\x80¦ On graduation, he worked for Arthur Andersen.

With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \\\\n\\\\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol (\\\\\\'https\\\\\\' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \\\\n\\\\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \\\\n\\\\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \\\\n\\\\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \\\\n\\\\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \\\\n\\\\nBase One Technologies â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Corporate Strategy â\\\\x80\\\\x93 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \\\\nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

Though we are two weeks out from Election Day as I sit to write these words â\\\\x80\\\\x93 I find myself already looking beyond Tuesday, November the eighth and at some of the things that I think will happen between now and 2020 as well as what I think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that year\\\\\\'s election. It won\\\\\\'t be a popular opinion here on ATS, I am sure... But as of today I feel confident in saying that, short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event â\\\\x80\\\\x93 this years election is very likely a done deal. Hillary Clinton will almost certainly be the next President of the United States. With just two weeks remaining before Election Day ( as of this writing ), the meta-analysis of polls shows Clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead. While it is true that Trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base, he has done little to successfully expand that base. The potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day. Having come to this view, I find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post 2016 world will look like. Frankly, gazing into my allegorical crystal ball, I see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon. Clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way. Election Night Blues The night of Tuesday, November the eighth could well be historic â\\\\x80\\\\x93 in the worst of ways. This election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways. It has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has built-up a great deal of social tension. We currently sit atop a very, very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile. Passions will be flaring among many as we watch the Election results stream in on our televisions, computers and phones. Many of those watching will be deeply, deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race. In this climactic moment we, as a nation, will be perilously close to critical mass. One spark away from potential disaster... Four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media, Twitter, to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion... That minor celebrity was one Donald J. Trump: Source Imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this Election night. Imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger. Then stop imagining and take a deep breath... Such a reaction is not just possible â\\\\x80\\\\x93 given the evidence, it is more than likely the probable outcome. Trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged, that they have no voice and that he is \"the only one\" who can save them. This is a very, very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry. Most Trump supporters, obviously, will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race â\\\\x80\\\\x93 even if they personally feel that the outcome of the Election was not legitimate. However some Trump supporters, those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling \"the alt right\" very well could take to the streets in rage. Given some of the fringe support that Trump enjoys, I would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe. The rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally... Across the line. Blunty put â\\\\x80\\\\x93 if Election night comes and Trump loses â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and if he takes to Twitter as he did four years ago â\\\\x80\\\\x93 it could well result in a very long and bloody night. A catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame. A night that could well poison our nation for years to come. Much Ado About Trump TV Many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that Trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation... Presumably a news network or service of some kind. I count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time. However where I differ is that I don\\\\\\'t see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer. While I do think that Trump\\\\\\'s original thoughts ( or more the thoughts of those who influence Trump ) was to create a new media Conservative news venue... I think that it\\\\\\'s now grown into something more. I think that Trump TV ( Or whatever they end up calling it - \"Trump TV\" is too generic. There\\\\\\'s no inherent propaganda value in the name. I think something more like \"Trump\\\\\\'s MAGA Network\" is probably more on point. ) will be used as a device to begin a new political party. More accurately to succeed where others have previously failed ( Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m looking at you Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck ) by congealing the various \"Patriot\", \"Tea Party\" and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal. My prediction is that Donald Trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement â\\\\x80\\\\x93 using this new network much as he currently utilizes his Twitter feed... A platform for him to vent his late night frustrations, angers and insecurities. His name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and Trump will be the face of it all. The most frequent speaker and guest. Imagine if The Apprentice had been a 24/7/365 live streaming show â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and Trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind... That is how I see Trump TV. However I don\\\\\\'t see Trump being the driving force behind the actual message. Trump is a brand, after all. He has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didn\\\\\\'t build, shows that he didn\\\\\\'t create and ideas he didn\\\\\\'t originate. Trump works as a spokesperson â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the guy who says \"Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m not only the President of... But I\\\\\\'m also a member\". The real people behind the curtain will be The Mercers ( Robert and Rebekah ), Steve Bannon and, to a lesser degree, Roger Ailes. As for on camera talents? I think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be Hannity, O\\\\\\'Reilly and Lahren â\\\\x80\\\\x93 though I\\\\\\'m honestly not personally sure if O\\\\\\'Reilly will make the jump. Money is money, after all, and Big Daddy Bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the Fox news heap as his career winds down. Regardless, however, of who wins the backstage power war ( Other than the Mercers who are a lock ) and the on camera positions... The network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and I think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming 4-8 years. Particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics.\\'\\n \"on November 13, 2016 4:03 pm Â· \\\\nPost election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s proof. \\\\nThe American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked â\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s VERY unlikely that whites arenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t getting jobs because minorities are, but thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9cextremely likelyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . \\\\nThen, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. \\\\nPost election, this is what the study found: \\\\nThe question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is â\\\\x80\\\\x9cextremely likelyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that whites canâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is â\\\\x80\\\\x9cnot at allâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is â\\\\x80\\\\x9cextremely likelyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t think that. \\\\nMore than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are â\\\\x80\\\\x9cviolent.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d 84 percent think that of Muslims. \\\\nUnfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: \\\\nDemocrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. \\\\nGreat idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigotsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 claims go unchallenged. \\\\nFeatured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images Share this Article!

I hope you enjoy it! Master of the Estate \"This coach really is quite wonderful, Jonathan. I can barely feel the bumps and I don\\\\\\'t feel like I\\\\\\'m about to be thrown out the window!\" Eleanor exclaimed. \"It is grand, isn\\\\\\'t it?\" \"It\\\\\\'s all grand. The trip, our coach...and you,\" she said, smiling and snuggling in closer to Jonathan on the wide leather seat. \"I could do without this fog, though. I would like to see the moon and stars later tonight.\" He pulled the curtain aside slightly with a gloved hand and peered mournfully through the window at the white mist that nearly obscured everything. He could hardly see the tops of the trees it was so thick. Just then a particularly large bump jostled them roughly, followed closely by another. \"Oh!\" squealed Eleanor. Jonathan\\\\\\'s brow drew down. \"Driver!\" he called out the window. \"Is everything alright?\" \"Beg pardon, sir. I fear I may have taken a wrong turn at that fork back a ways. There\\\\\\'s a house up ahead...I\\\\\\'ll check in with them and make sure. Sturbridge Village can\\\\\\'t be far now, and we\\\\\\'re better safe than sorry with this fog rolling in, if you take my meaning, sir. Don\\\\\\'t want to be out past dark in this soup.\" Jonathan looked at Eleanor. \"Well, it would be nice to stretch our legs for a moment,\" she said. She was not quite as cheerful as she had been just minutes ago. The October afternoon was cooling off as evening approached, and Jonathan could see his breath. The coach trundled past well-maintained stone gables and a heavy wrought-iron gate, standing open on one side. Oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog, and additional lanterns spilled pools of yellow-orange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house. Eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view. \"It\\\\\\'s beautiful!\" Jonathan made a surprised \"hm\", but otherwise said nothing. A well-dressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door, then offered a white-gloved hand to Eleanor as she peered out. With a flashed smile at Jonathan, she accepted the young man\\\\\\'s hand and descended. The driver was speaking quietly with another footman, and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as Jonathan descended the steps of the coach. The older man - clearly the butler - bowed to Eleanor and Jonathan. \"Welcome to the Anne Union Keyes Estate. I am Mister Walker, and I am at your service. The master of the estate has invited you in for the evening meal.\" The butler spoke with some kind of British accent, but beyond that Jonathan not say from where exactly. \"Good Lord man, we just arrived unannounced!\" \"Yes, sir, but Herr von Graeff enjoys entertaining and was notified of your arrival as you drove up. I would be honored if you would follow me...\" he gestured toward the polished steps. Eleanor was the type of woman who, once her mind was made, up, proceeded without hesitation. She must have decided they were staying for dinner, for with a delighted squeal she headed for the house. They were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man. Jonathan estimated he was in his seventies, hair fully white with deep creases in his face on age showing on his hands. However, the man was tall and straight-backed, and he carried himself proudly. There was a stiffness to his movements, and he used a cane to walk, but when Jonathan shook his large hands the man\\\\\\'s grip was as firm as a man half his age. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said warmly and with what Jonathan thought was a German accent. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am Gottfried HansjÃ¼rgen von Graeff. Please, be welcome in my home. How may I call you?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d The manâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes were unusual, but Jonathan could not place what it was about them that seemed so. He shrugged it off. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Herr von Graeff. I am Jonathan Rockport, this is my fiancÃ©e Eleanor Harrington. We really have only stopped to find our way back to the highway. We are trying to get to Sturbridge Village to stay for the night before continuing on to Fall River in the morning.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes, well, you will not make it to Sturbridge Village in this fog.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Herr von Graeff pronounced the name of the town with a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cshâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d sound. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt least, not before dark, even if you left now. It is fifteen miles yet. Why donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t you join me for dinner, stay here tonight, and then resume your journey first thing tomorrow?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are a generous host, Herr von Graeff, but I really would like to press on if possible. I have business meetings in Massachusetts and must be in Fall River by Tuesday. â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, a wonderful town, Fall River, yes? Tell me, how is the new railway doing? I understand the esteemed Mr. Borden opened the branch line just last year, yes?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jonathan slowly, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe railway has been a smashing success. In fact, it is Mr. Borden I have an appointment to see. I have a business proposition for him that I think he will be quite excited about.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn entrepreneur!â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Exclaimed Herr von Graeff. â\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent! I always enjoy conversing with a businessman, especially you Americans. Always such big ideas, yes? Please, let us carry on our conversation over dinner. Mister Walker,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, pronouncing the butlerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s name with a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cvâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwould you lead us to the dining hall?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, Herr von Graeff.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\'\\n \\'By Carey Wedler When it comes to brute force, law enforcement and private security currently have the upper hand on the ground in Standing Rock,... \\'\\n \\'By Catherine J. Frompovich \\\\nPart 1 of 4 \\\\nThe following is the testimony I will present pro se [without a lawyer representing me] to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Administrative Law Court, November 2 and 3, 2016 as a result of my not permitting an AMI Smart Meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by PECO, an Exelon Company that provides electricity and service to the suburban Philadelphia where I live. \\\\nThis testimony addresses most of the health, legal, and constitutional issues, plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and RF/EMF cancer-causing technology forced on consumers, along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an AMI Smart Meter. \\\\nThere are four parts to the entire testimony that was 18 pages long plus 195 pages of Exhibits A-1 thru W, and other documentation I had in my brief case (not presented but as backup, if needed) that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation, published research, etc. \\\\nPersonally, I think after reading the entire testimony, which will appear in four parts, readers can understand whatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s involved with unsafe, fire-prone, and RF/EMF/dirty electricity-producing AMI Smart Meters when for decades utilities provided safe, non-plastic parts analog meters. Before the Administrative Law Court at the PA Public Utility Commission Philadelphia, PA â\\\\x80\\\\x93 November 2 & 3, 2016 \\\\nYour Honor, Judge Heep and Judge Pell, Members of the PA PUC, PECO Energy Company, the Exelon legal team, and all interested parties: \\\\nSince today is the rescheduled postponed June 27, 2016 hearing and for which I, Catherine J Frompovich, submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules, I have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous 75 pages (10 pages of testimony and 65 pages of Exhibits A thru Q) that I submitted via the U.S. Postal Service and which all parties received, I presume. \\\\nHowever, in view of the paramount importance, plus dire consequences, of EMFs/RFs being forced onto Pennsylvania consumers with no opt-out for personal safety and protection from 24/7/365 non-ionizing radiation emitted by AMI Smart Meters microwave technology, and my being a five-year breast cancer survivor, I submit into testimony and evidence that the PA PUC and all participating Pennsylvania utilities, not just PECO as in my case, must factor in the American with Disabilities Act Amendments, which redefine cancer as a disability, especially since there are cancer-causing effects from EMFs/RFs about which I submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of Exhibits per the Schedule of Exhibits I now introduce, plus printed documents I have with me in support of the four-page Bibliography of Pertinent Published Literature Regarding Electromagnetic Radiation, Cancer & AMI Smart Meters that I also submit into the record as Exhibit S . \\\\nSince the ADA Amendments Act provides for three â\\\\x80\\\\x9cprongsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of what constitutes a disability, I am submitting into evidence a printout titled â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmericans with Disability Act Amendments Act (ADAAA)â\\\\x80\\\\x9d pointing out appropriate and applicable sections Exhibit A-1 ; a two-page printout titled â\\\\x80\\\\x9cADA Amendments redefine cancer as a disabilityâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d Exhibit A-2 ; along with a 43-page dossier containing about 240 published studies regarding BREAST and Other Cancers and EMF/ELF/RF Cancer Studies Exhibit A-3 ; and topping off those documents with a two-page letter dated 2 August 2016 from the foremost EMF/RF researchers, physicians and academics in the WORLD written to the North Carolina Utilities Commission Exhibit A-4 wherein in the third paragraph they state: \\\\nSmart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter RFR. Smart meter RFR consists of frequent, very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day. Because smart meter exposure over a 24 hour period can be very prolonged ( pulses can average 9,600 times a day ), and because there is building evidence that the sharp, high intensity pulses are particularly harmful , the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters. \\\\nThose five researchers, David Carpenter, MD, Director, Institute for Health and the Environment, University of Albany Dr Lennart Hardell, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Oncology, University Hospital Orebro, Sweden Dr Magda Havas, BSC, PhD, Environmental & Resources Studies. Trent University, Canada Dr Martha Herbert, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Pediatric Neurologist and Neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Dr Sam Milham, MD, MPH, Former chief epidemiologist, Washington State Department of Health \\\\npoint out in the last sentence of the first paragraph, â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦ it is imperative that the North Carolina Utilities Commission be fully aware of the harm that RFR can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nFrompovich respectfully points out, and also cautions the PA PUC, that in not permitting opt outs from AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania during formulating its AMI SM regulations, since HB2200 stated AMI SMs were NOT to be mandated , it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe AMI SMs regarding the RFRs they emit. Various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing AMI SMs opt outs, which the PA PUC deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding AMI SMs thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which, in essence, violate the Nuremberg Code since consumersâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 consent was not required nor asked, and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on PECOâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s customers. \\\\nAgain, Frompovich points to the letter addressed to the NCUC Exhibit A-4 at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the U.S. NTP June 2016 study Conclusion in part stating â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nFrompovich further elaborates that cell phone RFR exposure is elective , i.e., depending upon personal choice, use, and an individualâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s ability to turn off cell phones, thereby reducing and/or avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and RFRs exposures both cell phones and AMI SMs produce. \\\\nHowever, harmful personal bodily RFR exposure has been mandated by PA PUC Regulationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94not HB2200/Act 129 (2008) and, therefore, is absolutely illegal, since Act 129 does not defy nor negate the Pennsylvania state constitutionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9cInherent Rights of Mankind, Section 1â\\\\x80\\\\x9d, but itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Commonwealthâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s regulatory agencyâ\\\\x80\\\\x94the PA PUCâ\\\\x80\\\\x94that is guilty of nonfulfillment, I allege: \\\\nAll men [and women] are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation , and of pursuing their own happiness. â\\\\x80¦ Pennsylvania Constitution, Section 1. \\\\nHowever, contrary to that Pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated AMI Smart Meter RFR exposure, because of no opt outs in Pennsylvania specifically via PA PUC Regulations not Act 129, literally provides no way to escape and/or avoid AMI SMs microwave RFRs. That is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally, Frompovich contends. Furthermore, the PA PUC overstepped its agency powers and, Frompovich contends, is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process. \\\\nThe above five researchers Exhibit A-4 delineate cell phone and Smart Meters as basically the same â\\\\x80\\\\x9canimalâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum! See paragraph 3 of their letter to the NCUC for more detail, including that Smart Meters over a 24-hour period can average 9,600 pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdirty electricity .â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nI submit into the record Exhibit A-5 Dirty Electricity or Dirty Power and the 10-page report â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy Are Electromagnetic Fields Dangerous? â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Is Dirty Electricity Making You Sick?â\\\\x80\\\\x9d including 2 charts [ Table 1 Ranking Electric Meters and Table 2 Ranking Electric Meters for Risk of Privacy and Cyber Security] from the 20-page report â\\\\x80\\\\x9cRanking Electricity Meters for Risk to Health, Privacy, and Cyber Security,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d available online at https://www.scribd.com/doc/289782183/Ranking-Electricity-Meters-for-Risk-to-Health-Privacy-and-Cyber-Security . \\\\nThe KEY dispute and multi-faceted issue of concern in Frompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s case â\\\\x80\\\\x93 being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years â\\\\x80\\\\x93 is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear, exposure to cancer-causing EMFs, and/or actuality of contracting cancer due to AMI SM RFR exposures 24/7/365 in her homeâ\\\\x80\\\\x94something that the ADA Amendments Act indisputably encompass, since once a cancer patient that makes Frompovich covered within one of the ADAAA prongs for all time, and also includes Frompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s indefeasible right to protect propertyâ\\\\x80\\\\x94 both her home and her personal body and its life processes â\\\\x80\\\\x94including her reputation. \\\\nThat federal ADAAA must be factored into Frompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s case since PECO has obtained federal grant monies to implement its AMI Smart Meters rollout, and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the ADAAA, including state regulatory agencies like the PA PUC. \\\\nFrompovichâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s refusal of an AMI SM, plus her human and innate right to protect her health, body and property, are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦ the strongest evidence for hazards coming from RFR is cancer , there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity (EHS).â\\\\x80\\\\x9d See paragraph 4 of the letter to NCUC Exhibit A-4 . \\\\nOn page 2, paragraph 1 of that same letter, the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science, which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental, if not predictable , variances, as per the chart I raise up and submit into the record , a double-sided poster â\\\\x80\\\\x9cRadiofrequency Research: Does Funding Matter,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics. \\\\nNon-industry studies indicate 70% harmful effects with 30% no effects, while industry studies indicate 32 % harmful effects with 68% no effects! Statistically, thatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s almost a wash, as each just about cancels the other, however, thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a slight edge of 2% from non-industry studies indicating harmful effects. More interestingly, though, is that industry studies DID find 32% harmful effects studiesâ\\\\x80\\\\x94almost one-third of the studies and, yet, the industry concludes differently stating there are none! That alone should be a red flag for them, or anyone of scientific mind, to investigate further and they did not, which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out. Is that a crime of omission or collusion? \\\\nParagraph 2 on page 2 of that letter Exhibit A-4 cites the obvious CRUX of scientific and ethical issues regarding AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania, in particular, stating â\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith a leading [NC] DHHS staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature, and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance, the DHHS conclusion is not surprising.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nFrompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred, and still occurs, with and from PECO and the PA PUC, thereby illegally depriving Frompovich and all Pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property, along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental AMI Smart Meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize non-thermal adverse health effects from RFRs, which have been known since 1932! I introduce Exhibit T Electrosensitivity (ES) and Electromagnetic Hyper-sensitivity (EHS) into the record to document that in 1962, 1979, 2009 and 2015 various health issues have been identified with EMF non-thermal exposures. \\\\nYour Honors, I respectfully ask the court to instruct PECO to produce the experimental studies, rather than epidemiological studies, indicating no non-thermal effects from EMFs/RFs. Whereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s the science? \\\\nArenâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t PECOâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s customers entitled to have that evidence? \\\\nFrompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following: How much influence did the microwave industry contribute to PA State Representative Robert Godshallâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign coffers and/or his preferred charities that apparently has enabled Godshall, as Chair of the PA House Consumer Affairs Committee, to sit on opt out bills in the PA legislature for several legislative sessions, including Godshallâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote, which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving Pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fire-prone AMI SMs in Pennsylvania. \\\\nHereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s what other U.S. states have done regarding AMI Smart Meters: \\\\nAnalog meters are definitively offered as the opt-out meter in four states: Arizona, California, Maine, and Texas. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgreatest customer acceptance,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which, clearly, is the analog. \\\\nThree states offer the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cexisting meterâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d as the opt-out meter. An existing meter might or might not be analog. Georgia, Hawaii, and Consumers Energy in Michigan. \\\\nThree states let the utility decide: Florida, Maryland, and Nevada. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgreatest customer acceptance,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d which, clearly, is the analog. \\\\nFour states or utilities definitively forbid analog opt-outs: Fountain in Colorado, DTE in Michigan, Central Hudson Valley in New York (AMR), and Port Angeles in Washington (touted as the first place to ban smart metersâ\\\\x80\\\\x94not much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home!). \\\\nTwo states/districts require smart meters: Pennsylvania and Washington, DC. \\\\nSource: http://www.smartmetereducationnetwork.com/optout-status-other-states.php \\\\nContinued in Part 2. \\\\nCatherine J Frompovich ( website ) is a retired natural nutritionist who earned advanced degrees in Nutrition and Holistic Health Sciences, Certification in Orthomolecular Theory and Practice plus Paralegal Studies.

The FBI turned on Hillary. WANT TO KNOW WHY? Because in Florida, where they flipped a HUGE number of votes, Trump still had 68 percent of the vote. Nationwide they did not have the vote scam machines everywhere, and when that got averaged in, Trump took 82 percent of the votes nationwide EVEN WITH THE STOLEN VOTES SUBTRACTED FROM THE AVERAGE. THE FBI, FOX, CNN, EVERYONE ELSE KNEW THE GIG WAS UP, AND IS NOW ONLY MOVING TO SAY \"SORRY\" SO THEY DON\\\\\\'T GO TO JAIL. \\\\n\\\\nWell, I\\\\\\'ve got news for you: they are still the same lying despicable malfunctioning trash scum they always were; THEY SHOWED THEIR WORTH, and we would be IDIOTS to forgive them, no matter how badly they burn Hillary. \\\\n\\\\nCNN is despicable trash; we all witnessed it. NEVER FORGIVE THEM , because they have proven their worth already. No matter what they do, they can\\\\\\'t recover from what they have done: they are garbage, a disease, bleach-worthy filth, and I hope Trump ERASES THEM. DITTO FOR ALL of the rest of the MSM, including The Huffington Post, Snopes, ABC-CBS-FOX-YOUNAMEIT â\\\\x80\\\\x93 ALL of them are the lowest of filth that is now heading for the darkness of the nearest sewer to get away from the coming bulldozer. \\\\n\\\\nTHE FBI is a trash agency, along with the rest of American intelligence, which only works to serve the enemy for as long as it thinks its head will not be cut off. ALL of the FBI MUST BE DISBANDED and EVERYONE in the FBI should be blackballed and never allowed to work again, with the top echelons jailed for life for treason. THEY LIED ABOUT 9-11 AND THEY KNEW IT , and have proven they serve one purpose: to protect evil. Ditto for the CIA, the NSA, the DHS, the TSA, and all the rest of the trash. All of it needs to go; there is not one fragment of it that should be salvaged. \\\\n\\\\nSo they are all running like rats for cover: they know they blew it, they know they are going to be bagged for heinous crimes against America. Now they are putting on the biggest fakest show the world will ever witness. As if they cared! They never did care, and I hope to God Trump has a memory longer than the average jarhead and bags every last one of them when he has his day. They had BETTER run for the gates and ditch the country just like they said they would if he got elected â\\\\x80\\\\x93 because if not, they are heading straight to the gates of justice. \\\\n\\\\nI would like to thank everyone in the alt-media who made this happen. And I would also like to say that I said it all along as it was and NEVER backed off: Hillary never had more than 8 percent national support. This is something I said repeatedly: that Trump was always 80+ percent supported, and I never wavered and never once posted bullshit like OH, LET\\\\\\'S REJOICE, TRUMP IS AT 51 PERCENT! That was always a trap â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a scam, to justify stealing the election â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and I called it as it was. \\\\n\\\\nOur job is not over \\\\n\\\\nThe rot is there. It is deeply rooted, with fungus roots running all the way through the country. One bottle of bleach is not going to do more than spot-clean the surface. We won this battle, and it is NOT time to sit down. The alt-media cannot rest until CNN and all of the rest of the MSM is either bankrupted or jailed. The alt-media CANNOT rest for as long as Google is allowed to wage war on websites like this one by refusing to allow it ads. If this website were allowed ads, it would easily self-fund with $12,000 plus per month (and would probably have more than $24,000 per month). Denial of ads just because someone disagrees and has a monopoly established via full control of various ad firms is a flagrant violation of antitrust laws, and has to be stopped dead cold. \\\\n\\\\nThe alt-media cannot stop until every last criminal in the FBI is jailed BY THE FBI. I am sick of the bait tactics and false flag psyops fronted by that agency: heads have GOT TO ROLL, PILES OF THEM, especially since it has been proven that it was the FBI itself that did the first World Trade Center bombing, with the full intent to bring one of the towers down. That\\\\\\'s the type of agency that has got to be shuttered â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or we are all toast, Trump or not. Yeah, I know YOU, at the FBI, are reading this. GO TO HELL. \\\\n\\\\nOur job will not be over until the CIA is cleaned out. Our job is not over until the American Bar Association is disbanded as the criminal bloodsucking hive it is. Our job is not over until the top executives at the medical companies that produced the tainted autism-inflicting vaccines hang with stretched necks. Our job will not be over until every last liberal arts and women\\\\\\'s studies department of all universities have their staffs jailed for treason. They gutted the home front in a manner which was horrific beyond belief. Our job is not over until all of America\\\\\\'s great libraries are fully restored after being totally wiped out by the Jews, and ALL scientific journals and works once again become fully free and public domain. Our job will not be over until the child-snatching CPS is shut down and their feed for their slave trade is cut off. Our job will not be over until American corporations begin to fight for America, and bring our jobs and American quality back. \\\\n\\\\nThe list of what the alt-media needs to accomplish now that it appears the first huge battle has been won is practically endless. But I believe the alt-media is up to the task, and will succeed as long as ONE THING IS CEMENTED IN STONE: \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJULIAN ASSANGE IS OBVIOUSLY DEAD. \\\\n\\\\nConsider these facts, and then figure the odds of him being alive: \\\\n\\\\n1. Wikileaks\\\\\\' DNS server was suddenly pointed elsewhere. That\\\\\\'s right: that night, in the wee hours of the morning after Pamela was there (to poison him), police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy; and THAT NIGHT, the DNS server pointed to a different IP address for Wikileaks, and GOOGLE updated everything instantly, so the transfer was completely seamless from the real Wikileaks server to the fake Wikileaks server that was at a completely different IP address. \\\\n\\\\n2. Mr. Assange\\\\\\'s subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters. I reported this repeatedly. \\\\n\\\\n3. Mr. Assange\\\\\\'s tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades (Gavin McFadyen became McFayden, for example). McFadyen, 76, the director of Wikileaks, was found dead three days after Assange started having mystery problems. This is something I made a huge issue of here. \\\\n\\\\n4. Streams of disinformation were spewed. \\\\n\\\\n5. Themes supported by Mr. Assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications. Very bad timing with that. Everyone with a brain noticed this, and it lit up the forums and blogs. \\\\n\\\\n6. \"Body double\" rumors have been circulated and documented. \\\\n\\\\n7. New, strange, hitherto unknown moderators of Wikileaks have suddenly been installed. \\\\n\\\\n8. His \"deadman switch\" WAS ACTIVATED BEFORE THE ARMORED VEHICLE EVEN SHOWED UP AT THE EMBASSY, which means Assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned. Much of his stored data and secret website PINs were to be released in the event of his untimely death (I released both deadman switches here, one encrypted and one unencrypted). \\\\n\\\\nAll of this happened right after Pamela Anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned, and the media talked all about how Assange was \"pale\" and \"not feeling well\" when she left, and that he said the food Pamela brought him was \"torture\". Good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the MSM, no doubt. \\\\n\\\\nMY TAKE: ASSANGE WAS POISONED, AND THEN REMOVED FROM THE EMBASSY IN AN ARMORED VEHICLE. This was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss, and I saw that and stayed up the entire night for it. That is why I so strongly stated that he can\\\\\\'t possibly still be at the embassy. Perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded. \\\\n\\\\nIf the new \"wikileak releases\" are real, they are NOT coming from the Wikileaks server â\\\\x80\\\\x93 only a re-direct to a different server in the name of Wikileaks. The IP address change proves it, and we can only hope it is white hats doing it. It seems so, but one can only guess. \\\\n\\\\nRelated: \\\\n\\\\nDid Google Kill Julian Assange? \\'\\n \"link originally posted by: Kashai Hyperloop one is a about a transportation system that is really fast and technologically feasible to the extent that in relation to investors, easily Is on the fast tract to half a billion from investors in the not to distant future.

In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. \\\\nWhen told about alleged reports of a â\\\\x80\\\\x98Trump supporterâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am so saddened to hear that.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d He then added, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I say, â\\\\x80\\\\x98Stop it.â\\\\x80\\\\x99 If it helps, I will say this â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and I will say right to the cameras: â\\\\x80\\\\x98Stop it.\\\\\\'â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nOne big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged â\\\\x80\\\\x9cabusesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf â\\\\x80\\\\x93 without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was â\\\\x80\\\\x98drive-byâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. \\\\nNow, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s perfectly understandable that Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory over the establishmentâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that â\\\\x80\\\\x98theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of Americaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating â\\\\x80\\\\x9chate crimeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow â\\\\x80\\\\x9ccausing many minorities fearful about the futureâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. \\\\nIn fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged â\\\\x80\\\\x98hate crimeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 incident â\\\\x80\\\\x93 one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. \\\\nBuzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : \\\\nA woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. \\\\nThe woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. \\\\nLafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cDuring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the statement reportedly read. \\\\nNOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described â\\\\x80\\\\x9cjournalistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of Americaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s corrupt liberal mainstream media. \\\\nThatâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s right â\\\\x80\\\\x93 this was just another hoax: \\\\nViolent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs \\\\nWhat Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesdayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s election, nearly all of the so-called â\\\\x80\\\\x98violent hate crimesâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 have been carried out against Trump supporters â\\\\x80\\\\x93 by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. \\\\nHere are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared.

He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. \\\\nFrom reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s political intimidation done on the street â\\\\x80\\\\x93 which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers â\\\\x80\\\\x93 enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: .

It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style â\\\\x80\\\\x98safeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of â\\\\x80\\\\x98job for lifeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution.

But itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. \\\\nNow CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNNâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s which was just dirty politics in comparison.

Donald Trump\\\\\\'s virtual hijacking of the Republican Party has stripped the competition between the two dominant sections of the ruling class down to its most naked form. The corporate media\\\\\\'s non-stop coverage of Trump was supposed to legitimize the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and rake in enormous profits for the monopoly outlets. The eyes of the rich have been on Hillary Clinton to rescue the two-party system from the danger of Donald Trump. However, thanks to WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton appears poised to take the Democratic Party down its own path of destruction.\\\\nThe FBI announcement that it will reopen the investigation of Clinton\\\\\\'s private email server has significantly eroded the momentum of the Democratic Party campaign. Trump appeared finished by the end of the third Presidential debate. His campaign was mired in sexual assault allegations and media inquiries into possible tax evasion. The billionaire white nationalist has suddenly found himself within one point of Hillary Clinton in recent polls. No matter how many traps Trump falls into or how vile his campaign rhetoric, Clinton has proven that no amount of Trump debauchery can save her from her political record.\\\\nUnfortunately, the email scandal has been subject to the limitations of corporate media coverage. The threat to \"national security\" has been cited as the number one issue with Clinton\\\\\\'s breach of State Department privacy. Indeed, Clinton did break the law and from this framework it is no doubt appropriate that she face the consequences. But under imperialism, where billions of people are exploited for the profits of monopoly corporations, the legitimacy of ruling class law is of little worth to the vast majority of humanity. What matters is the content of the emails themselves. The emails reveal that the current conditions of the imperialist system have thrown the two-party system into a permanent crisis of legitimacy.\\\\nThe first batch of emails dumped by WikiLeaks exposed how US imperialism serves the masters of war and capital. The initial emails proved that Clinton destabilized Libya in 2011 in order to stop the Gaddafi-led government from instituting an independent gold currency across the African continent . The emails also exposed that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) spent copious amounts of time deriding the Sanders campaign . Another batch of emails further damaged the Clinton cache with contents from her speeches to the big banks. It was in these speeches where she told Wall Street that she takes a different position in public than she does in private. In private, Clinton serenaded the ears of the rich with her desires to privatize Social Security and create a \"hemispheric common market.\"\\\\nThe emails have not been the only development that has soured Clinton\\\\\\'s election campaign. The Obama Administration announced in late October that premiums for the Affordable Care Act market-based exchanges are set to increase by 25 percent next year . Bill Clinton also made negative headlines through a leaked memo that revealed the former President utilized the Clinton Foundation to make profitable deals with private corporations . In other words, the Democratic Party has been unable to avoid looking like the corporate servant and imperialist party it always has been. With less than a month left until voting day, a Clinton victory is anything but secure.\\\\nMORE... The banana republic of America: Democracy be damned To the Superdelegates: Stand tall in statesmanship! Anointment of Hillary Clinton exposes a democracy that never was Democratic Party ignored its 2012 platform There are some in the US who believe that the demise of the Democratic Party will be a bad thing. Clinton has fewer staunch supporters among working people than she does individuals who are willing to hold their nose for Clinton in order to avoid a Trump Presidency. However, the stench emanating from the Clinton camp is becoming unbearable. Her campaign\\\\\\'s reliance on anti-Putin Russophobia threatens World War. Her policy record is equally, if not more deplorable, than Donald Trump\\\\\\'s capitalist, racist, and misogynistic machinations. The new email investigation could be the first nail of many to come in the Democratic Party coffin.\\\\nHowever, the fear of Trump is deeply embedded into the psyche of a large section of American voters. The corporate media has constantly fed many of her lies and suspicions to the masses. One of these myths is the alleged WikiLeaks-Russia-Trump alliance. No such alliance exists. Neither Putin nor WikiLeaks has announced any sort of allegiance to Trump. Putin has simply commented on Trump\\\\\\'s advocacy of a US-Russian partnership was a \"smart\" thing to say. Furthermore, Julian Assange has denied publicly that Trump would somehow present a better option than Hillary Clinton. But the truth matters little in a political environment that equates opposition to Clinton with support for Trump.\\\\nClinton has turned the Russian blame game toward the FBI. In a campaign speech, Clinton insinuated that the FBI is hiding information regarding the Putin-Trump alliance. Her claims were promptly proved false . Such remarks may cause more damage to an already unpopular campaign. US intelligence agencies are powerful institutions that current and future Presidents must curry the favor of to achieve the objectives of US imperialism. When President John F. Kennedy signaled that he wanted to break the CIA into a \"thousand pieces,\" he was assassinated shortly thereafter. It was revealed last year that the CIA was heavily involved in the cover-up of its involvement in his murder. US intelligence is thus the wrong crowd for a future US President to anger, especially given the vast surveillance apparatus now at its disposal.\\\\nSpeculation aside, the Clinton campaign emails present useful information on the depth of US imperialismâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s crisis. US imperialism has been mired in a period of stagnant economic growth and endless war for decades. It was only a matter of time before this crisis would express itself through its electoral system. Never has it been clearer that the two corporate parties in front of US imperial policy work solely for the ruling class. The task now is to utilize the developments of this election cycle in service of the people. That means shedding all fear of what the results of the election will be and basing our action on principles instead.\\'\\n \"Gov.

Democrats, after lavishing Comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an \"impartial\" way, have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the 2016 election cycle with Hillary herself describing his recent actions as \"deeply troubling\". Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Comey\\\\\\'s recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to Clinton staffers. \\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Daily Mail , and a source close to James Comey, the decision, at least in part, came after he \"could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI\" who \"felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\" \\\\nJames Comey\\\\\\'s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\'The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\\\\\\'t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\\\\\\' said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\'Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\\\\\\' said the source. \\\\\\'They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\\\\\\' \\\\n\\\\nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \\\\n\\\\nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\'The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,\\\\\\' the source continued. \\\\\\'And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. Though we\\\\\\'re sure there are many facets behind Comey\\\\\\'s decision making process, we can all be quite certain, at this point, that he\\\\\\'s not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in Washington, both in law enforcement and in both political parties.

If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause: racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobiaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpolitical correctnessâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, to be a paper tiger. \\\\nHowever, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and just as unreal â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct â\\\\x80\\\\x9c shitlib â\\\\x80\\\\x9d. \\\\nIn the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the â\\\\x80\\\\x9calternative rightâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of â\\\\x80\\\\x9cchildren of the sunâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. \\\\nThis is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me â\\\\x80\\\\x93 pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and quite unidirectional â\\\\x80\\\\x93 circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting Ã¼bermenschen â\\\\x80\\\\x93 from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. \\\\nHowever, thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Nietzsche) in itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. \\\\nThe symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos. \\\\nIn the lines to follow, weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and adjacent chaos logic â\\\\x80\\\\x93 through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . \\\\n\\\\nTriumph of the will or hipster Babylon working \\\\n\\\\nIn introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or perhaps too painfully intense reality â\\\\x80\\\\x93 when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly importantâ\\\\x80\\\\x93the victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality. â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nIt is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is â\\\\x80\\\\x9cKekâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and what exactly is â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmeme magicâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. \\\\nWeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cMemeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is an expression denoting â\\\\x80\\\\x9cinexistent existentâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to â\\\\x80\\\\x9cinfectâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. \\\\nWell, it works because it is magical. \\\\n\\\\nChaos Magick \\\\n\\\\nHere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern â\\\\x80\\\\x93 in fact posthumanist â\\\\x80\\\\x93 vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and should â\\\\x80\\\\x93 be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cprinciple of evolutionâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . \\\\nTherefore â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmeme magickâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cmemesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. \\\\nThe goal of practitioner of such magic â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic â\\\\x80\\\\x93 is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdomainâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. \\\\nThe idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . \\\\nThere are many interesting implications to this. \\\\nThe first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s no hierarchy of higher and lower â\\\\x80\\\\x93 thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing higher, thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing to be revered and everything can â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and indeed: should â\\\\x80\\\\x93 be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdream logicâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . \\\\nIn this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. \\\\nTrump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality â\\\\x80\\\\x93 virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives â\\\\x80\\\\x93 from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks â\\\\x80\\\\x93 is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective â\\\\x80\\\\x9creality tunnelâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. \\\\nIn this sense we can observe new â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod Emperor of USAâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet â\\\\x80\\\\x93 today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s remark to itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the worldâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. \\\\nSo that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek? \\\\nWell, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal â\\\\x80\\\\x9chalf-jokeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d: Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. \\\\nNamely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. \\\\nThe expression â\\\\x80\\\\x9ckekâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation â\\\\x80\\\\x9cLOLâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (â\\\\x80\\\\x9claughing out loudâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity â\\\\x80\\\\x93 ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. \\\\nIt is important to point out that in view of the most â\\\\x80\\\\x9cesoteric Kekistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities â\\\\x80\\\\x93 causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to â\\\\x80\\\\x98cuckâ\\\\x80\\\\x99(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not â\\\\x80\\\\x9cred pilledâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. \\\\nA good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification \\\\nHowever, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9eOne last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. \\\\nEvery post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. This number represents that postâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. \\\\nWith the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdubsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctripsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cquadsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, and so on. \\\\nSince a poster canâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t know their post number until after theyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve submitted the post, its common for people to â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbetâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits (â\\\\x80¦) When that endeavor proves a successful, a â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGETâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. \\\\nOut of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: Pepe the Frog (now /pol/â\\\\x80\\\\x99s unofficial mascot) Donald Trump (/pol/â\\\\x80\\\\x99s overwhelming candidate of choice) Repeating digit post numbers (â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGETSâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d) â\\\\x80\\\\x9cKEKâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctrollingâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general) \\\\nâ\\\\x80¦and a god was born.â\\\\x80\\\\x9c ( source ) \\\\n\\\\nSynchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. \\\\nNamely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpractitionerâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d to impose his own will and change the world â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. \\\\nI would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism â\\\\x80\\\\x93 in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles â\\\\x80\\\\x93 above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being â\\\\x80\\\\x93 into nothingness of primordial Chaos. \\\\n\\\\nPosthuman traditionalism \\\\n\\\\nI already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing â\\\\x80\\\\x93 with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition â\\\\x80\\\\x93 something Richard Spencer likes to call â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpolitical theologyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x93 founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cdo your own thingâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer â\\\\x80\\\\x93 half jokingly of course â\\\\x80\\\\x93 that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right â\\\\x80\\\\x9ctraditionalistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . \\\\nIn the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cidentityâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d in general and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhite identityâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and to a large extent made up â\\\\x80\\\\x93 pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among â\\\\x80\\\\x9cgameâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind â\\\\x80\\\\x93 actually the only one there is â\\\\x80\\\\x93 while at the same time musing about â\\\\x80\\\\x9calpha and beta malesâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, â\\\\x80\\\\x9csexual marketâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, â\\\\x80\\\\x9csignaling and counter-signalingâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. \\\\nThe allure of alt right lies in itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark â\\\\x80\\\\x93 with irony of the man who knows heâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. \\\\nWeâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. Thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s only one Chaos and thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s only one bringer of light from Chaos â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frogâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s main job . And itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s not the One to be defined as â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod from God, Light from Lightâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, but â\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod from Gutter, Light from Darknessâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. \\\\nSo, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your â\\\\x80\\\\x9chailâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. \\\\n*** \\\\nAuthor Branko MaliÄ\\\\x87 is a Croatian author and owner of Kali Tribune , with the background in classical philosophy.

However, for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same name.\\\\nThe SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3.000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebel-held territories in Syria and claims that it has, in three years, rescued about 70.000 lives according to its Twitter account (or 65 per day).\\\\nContrary to what you might think, it isnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation, incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence, which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO, the International Civil Defence Organisation , since 1972.\\\\nThe White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US$ 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US$ 100 million. And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place, i.e. in â\\\\x80\\\\x98liberatedâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 areas where hundreds of groups and some 80 countries, mainly NATO members, Gulf states and Saudi-Arabia, operate.\\\\nOn the White Helmetsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 briefing page it is stated that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfunding for their humanitarian relief work is received from the aid budgets of Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHere is how the Foreign Ministry in Copenhagen explains the roughly US$ 9 million to the White helmets from Denmark, a country that bombs in both Iraq and Syria.\\\\nOther civil society and humanitarian organisations inside Syria have not been so fortunate. Youâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ve probably not heard that much about the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and its work ? How much/little support have they received from Western humanitarian-concerned governments? And in general, civil society organisations in Syria â\\\\x80\\\\x93 women, peace, human rights, culture, etc. â\\\\x80\\\\x93 have received nothing like US$ 100 million in a few years and no one has such a flashy media appearance as the White Helmets.\\\\nThe White Helmets was started in 2013 by James Le Mesurier who seems to have tried a little of everything everywhere, including the grey zones of special forces and intelligence in virtually all NATO wars, Yugoslavia in particular. He later set up a foundation in Holland to gather the funds. Here is a recent account by Scott Ritter , former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and weapons inspector in Iraq with tremendous knowledge of things Middle East:\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe organizational underpinnings of the White Helmets can be sourced to a March 2013 meeting in Istanbul between a retired British military officer, James Le Mesurierâ\\\\x80\\\\x94who had experience in the murky world of private security companies and the shadowy confluence between national security and intelligence operations and international organizationsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and representatives of the Syrian National Council (SNC) and the Qatari Red Crescent Society. Earlier that month, the SNC was given Syriaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s seat in the Arab League at a meeting of the league held in Qatar.\\\\nAt that meeting, the SNC assumed Syriaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s seat, and the Arab League authorized member states to actively provide support, including arms and ammunition, to the Syrian rebels. The Qataris, working through the SNC, helped assemble for Le Mesurier $300,000 in seed money from Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom for a seven-day course designed to train and equip a 25-person rescue team, recruited by the SNC, for duty in so-called â\\\\x80\\\\x9cliberated areasâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d of Syria. The SNC made available a pair of Syrian activistsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Raed Saleh and Farouq Habibâ\\\\x80\\\\x94to assist Le Mesurier in this work.\\\\nThe group is â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as will be seen below â\\\\x80\\\\x93 treated as uncontroversial in virtually all Western mainstream media. However, there is enough material with documentation to merit caution.\\\\nIf you read media reports about the White Helmets and do not see the author mention that this groupâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s real identity is disputed and functions controversial you can be sure that you are wasting your time with somebody who is politically incredibly naive, or gullible; someone who has not done his or her research or is knowingly part of a deceptive effort serving a one-sided political agenda.\\\\nThe White Helmets definitely is an controversial NGO â\\\\x80\\\\x93 at the same time as it is (made) difficult to understand clearly what it really is.\\\\nAnd until the whole picture has been developed, anyone ought to be cautious with taking information about them at face value. So much must be clear given the links below.\\\\nDual purpose?\\\\nThat said, this author has not been on the ground but has studied both the pro- et contra links provided below.\\\\nSome observers draw the conclusion that the White Helmets â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Syrian Civil Defence â\\\\x80\\\\x93 is purely good guys rescuing lots of people, children in particular. The opposite advocacy claims that, all told, they are part of the terrorist groups, serve Western governments with intelligence and that their backers run political propaganda in their name and that they are simply executioners â\\\\x80\\\\x93 murderers with a human face.\\\\nBut does it have to be either/or?\\\\nAn alternative hypothesis could be that the White Helmets is a dual-purposeorganisation. They claim to be ordinary Syrian volunteers who came together around the idea of saving lives and are truly altruistic â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbakers, tailors, engineers, pharmacists, painters, carpenters, students and many more, the White Helmets are volunteers from all walks of life.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d It could well be that some of them actually are, even a majority.\\\\nThat doesnâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t preclude that other elements â\\\\x80\\\\x93 not the least those operating outside Syria such as foundations, PR and marketing firms, change organisations, NATO government and NGOs are in it with less noble, war-promoting purposes.\\\\nLink collection pro et contra\\\\nFind below a link collection â\\\\x80\\\\x93 long but fascinating in its wealth of information. We bring it as a help to those seriously interested in Syriaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s fate and in studying how opinions are being built by means of connected actors in a rather opaque networking structure, in how NGOs have increasingly become Near-governmental organisations and for those who do not want to sound foolish when they discuss these matters.\\\\nFirst some links to how the the White Helmets presents themselves. Second, some mainstream media articles in their favour of and praising it â\\\\x80\\\\x93 including some that argue that the White Helmets ought to receive the Nobel Peace Prize (which happens to be nonsense, since they donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t even remotely qualify according to the criteria in Alfred Nobelâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s very clear will and the prize is not a general do-good-prize. In addition, it must be doubted that the Nobel Committee will get more persuaded by the White Helmetsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 quite immodest â\\\\x80\\\\x93 campaign in favour of their own candidacy).\\\\nThird some links to the comprehensive network of organisations, including governments, that the White Helmets seem to be part of â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and it is quite a confusing lot with absolutely no transparency â\\\\x80\\\\x93 but quite a few investigations have been carried out.\\\\nAnd fourth and final â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the main links to investigative reports and other stuff that are sceptical in various degrees to the first three.\\\\n1.

Organisations in the network around the White Helmets\\\\nPurpose\\\\nA social movement creation and PR company that allegedly wants to change the world, co-founded by Jeremy Heimans â\\\\x80\\\\x93 whose mainstream, politically correct background you see here . Jeremy â\\\\x80\\\\x93 of course â\\\\x80\\\\x93 began his career with the strategy consultants McKinsey & Company. He also happens to be a co-founder of\\\\nAvaaz\\\\nAvaaz means voice or song in several languages and the organisation is known by millions as a petition platform for many good/progressive causes. Avaaz has some 43 million members around the world and is thus easily the largest NGO in the world.\\\\nAvaaz has also created Purpose.com. Here Jeremy Heimans, co-founder of Avaaz too, speaks to Forbes about his background and what the two companies do.\\\\nAvaaz is very active in promoting a No-Fly Zone in Syria which it explains in a petition text with these words: â\\\\x80\\\\x9cLetâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s build a resounding global call to Obama and other leaders to stand up to Putin and Assadâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s terror. This might be our last, best chance to help end this mass murder of defenceless children. Add your name.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe sad thing is that it has learnt nothing from its own campaign for a No-Fly Zone in Libya. John Hanrahan is a former executive director of The Fund for Investigative Journalism and reporter for The Washington Post, The Washington Star, UPI and other news organisations has made this extremely interesting analysis about how odd it is that Avaaz maintains an interventionist war-agenda in spite of earlier experiences and resistance even by high-ranking militaries.\\\\nHanrahan Quote: s Avaazâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s campaign director, former State Department official John Tye, â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat Avaaz shows 54,000 members in Syria in a population of 23 million â\\\\x80\\\\x93 which means that even if every Avaaz member supported a no-fly zone, this would still mean that only one of every 426 Syrians had â\\\\x80\\\\x9cvotedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d for one.\\\\nAvaaz spearheads â\\\\x80\\\\x93 at least in this matter â\\\\x80\\\\x93 an extreme militarist policy while â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAvaaz is a global web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhereâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Which people want a No-Fly Zone in Syria? Do they know itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a violation of a sovereign stateâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s airspace, of international law? That it would embolden every terrorist on Syrian soil because they would get rid of the Syrian Airforce as their enemy? That it continued into regime change in both Iraq and Libya?\\\\nMany questions unanswered by this peculiar â\\\\x80\\\\x9cpeople powerâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d organisation, more militarist than governments!\\\\nBut back to Purpose.com and one of its important clients:\\\\nThe Syria Campaign â\\\\x80\\\\x93 home\\\\nThey maintain on their website that â\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Syria Campaign is fiercely independent and has accepted no money from governments, corporations or anyone directly involved in the Syrian conflict. This allows us full autonomy to advocate for whatever is needed to save lives.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d But they also say that they have accepted funds from the Asfari Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and other anonymous donors.\\\\nThe Syria Campaign also states that it is only pro-human rights and pro-freedom and takes no side. But they explain the conflict in these words:\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe regime of Bashar al-Assad is responsible for crushing a peaceful uprising that has led to the deaths of over 450,000 people, the displacement of over 12 million â\\\\x80\\\\x93 half the country â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and the emergence of violent, extremist groups like Isis.\\\\nToday the fighting in Syria has given way to a world war with more than eighty countries involved on all sides.\\\\nThe majority of Syrians want neither Assad nor Isis. They want an end to the violence and a democratic Syria.\\\\nWhat is happening in Syria could be happening to any of us. No one is free until weâ\\\\x80\\\\x99re all free.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nI would characterise such a presentation as side-taking wrapped in substance-free marketing jargon; a very politicised statement wearing only black-and-white.\\\\nAbout the Syria Campaign\\\\nWhat the Syria Campaign is proud of: Impact page\\\\nThe Syria Campaign seeks all-stars senior campaigner and â\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou donâ\\\\x80\\\\x99t need to know anything about Syriaâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Syria Campaign on Facebook\\\\nThe Syria Campaign on Twitter\\\\nAnalysis, Research and Knowledge (Ark)\\\\nA private company, headquartered in Dubai, that describes itself as â\\\\x80\\\\x9ca research, conflict transformation and stabilisation consultancyâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d.\\\\nIn Syria â\\\\x80\\\\x9cArk has been at the forefront of the response to the conflict â\\\\x80¦ for the past five yearsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d.

Huge funding by NATO/EU countries which are militarily involved.\\\\n2. A degree of political lobbying â\\\\x80\\\\x93 a very specific explanation of the conflict and how it started which points to a no-fly zone, weaponization of human rights issues and speaks strongly against the Syrian government and Russia and very critically of the UN â\\\\x80\\\\x93 that is extremely unusual for a purely humanitarian organisation.\\\\n3. Incredibly advanced public relation in terms of very professional websites, videos and PR strategy dropping the right stories and images at the right time â\\\\x80\\\\x93 quite unique for a group of â\\\\x80\\\\x9cbakers, tailors and studentsâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d etc..\\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cOmram rescued from a Russian airstrikeâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x93 From the White Helmetsâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 homepage.\\\\n4. Too professional wordings and images, too much playing to (exploitation of) emotions, too catchy smart formulations again and again; in short, lacking every sense of genuine local quality. Too many children â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and cats â\\\\x80\\\\x93 in the images speaking to an audience with little politically consciousness but surely a good heart. In short, populist marketing also in the sense of conveying the message: Look how good we are and how evil everybody else are.\\\\n5. Guilt by association: If the White Helmets is a 100% humanitarian first responder organisation it must be extremely naive in ignoring that its integrity, credibility and noble purposes is put at risk with the specific network of organisations and governments that it has chosen to seek support from.\\\\n6. Substance versus public relation: how does a humanitarian organisation justify that millions of dollars are spent on self-promoting public relation rather than on saving more lives in such a horrific war? And taking so many photos and shoot films of its own work in the midst of massacres and bombing raids?\\\\n7. Itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s very difficult to discern who actually manages the White Helmets in general and in terms of day-to-day operations. One looks in vain for something like an organisational chart secretary-general, board, executive director (although one is mentioned, Raed Saleh, whom the US has on one occasion actually denied entry into the US).\\\\n8. How come that such an innovative organisation seems to have been started in circles that have to do with oil interests, British intelligence, mercenary/military operations and interventionist/bombing countries?\\\\n9. How come it works only in rebel/terrorist/liberated areas? Could it do that without co-operation or co-ordination with some of these groups? It has been stated â\\\\x80\\\\x93 naively â\\\\x80\\\\x93 by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation that their vision is to operate also on government-controlled territory and later be a leader in re-building a new democratic post-war Syria. However, why should the sovereign state of Syriaâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s legitimate government accept a foreign-based and -financed civil defence territory there when it has had its own since 1953?\\\\nPerhaps we should not be that surprised?\\\\nShould we be surprised that humanitarian workers are involved in â\\\\x80\\\\x9csomething elseâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d and are not exclusively devoted to doing no harm and doing good for humanity?\\\\nNot really.

(Diary 429) Speak to the world about My mercy ... It is a sign for the end times. After it will come the Day of Justice. While there is still time, let them have recourse to the fountain of My mercy. (Diary 848) Tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near. (Diary 965). I am prolonging the time of mercy for the sake of sinners. But woe to them if they do not recognize this time of My visitation. (Diary 1160) Before the Day of Justice, I am sending the Day of Mercy. (Diary 1588) He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. (Diary 1146). The Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by pope Francis, ends on November 20th the feast of Christ the King the end of the liturgical year. Every jubilee year is destined to end of course, that\\\\\\'s why it is a year and not a decade.But...isn\\\\\\'t it too much prophecy gathered in that last year? First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. \"Nothing happened, again\" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God\\\\\\'s mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God\\\\\\'s loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don\\\\\\'t know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell. Time that runs out, according to Anguera and other apparitions of Virgin Mary. That doesn\\\\\\'t mean it has all to happen on December 1st. Every next week draws us closer to the two doors, one of which is the Door of Mercy and the other the Door of Justice. Your take on recent catholic prophecy?

I\\\\\\'ve been into this a very long time, and with that perspective I see some repeating patterns. To the point of the op, this is the same old same old--with a new generation of players. We\\\\\\'ve seen the same exact thing over the last 70 years with people like George Adamski, David Fry, Billy Meier, William Moore, and Steven Greer. It\\\\\\'s the same story: A privileged individual is given the keys to open a few doors about what \"really is happening.\" Tom DeLonge believes (and that\\\\\\'s all it takes) he has been given these keys, and he\\\\\\'s running with it, as his handlers knew he would. Tom sees this whole \"Sekret Machines\" schtick as a \"franchise.\" That\\\\\\'s how he talks about it. when he says \"franchise\" he\\\\\\'s talking in George Lucas Star Wars terms with movie tie-ins, merchandise, graphic novels, coffee cups, t-shirts, and back packs. That\\\\\\'s his vision for this. He sees opportunity to make this thing BIG. Now, he\\\\\\'s been writing to Podesta and who knows who else, but he and we know Podesta has an interest in UFOs. So Podesta is seen by Tom as an \"in\" for what he perceives as the new administration and he is offering himself as a legitimate representative of his generation. His statement to Podesta is one of POSITIONING HIMSELF as a natural go-between for these issues--especially with \"young people.\" It has nothing really to do with young people being disenfranchised and cynical and everything to do with Tom DeLonge taking an important position vis-a-vis \"Disclosure.\" If DeLonge pulls this off it won\\\\\\'t be Stephen Bassett of the Paradigm Research Group or Steven Greer, who \"once had dinner with the head of the CIA\" whose name is forever associated with \"Disclosure.\" The name everyone will remember is Tom DeLonge. THAT\\\\\\'S what is happening here. DeLonge is attempting to position himself to take major advantage of what he now thinks is reality, and which also includes a major Star-Wars-sized \"franchise\" that has the potential of turning him from a mere multi-millionaire into something much larger. Of course, he may also be a dupe and or delusional, but he may not know that yet. edit on 10/27/2016 by schuyler because: (no reason given)\\'\\n \\'on November 13, 2016 3:09 pm Â· \\\\nAs predicted, Donald Trumpâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities. \\\\nAnd itâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it. \\\\nTwitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him.

(Photo illustration 21WIRE) \\\\nOver the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress , John Podesta â\\\\x80\\\\x98s top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook . \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98POLITICAL BOMBSHELLâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer.

Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera â\\\\x80\\\\x93 he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98DNC SCANDALâ\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard ) \\\\nCreamerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky . \\\\nWhite House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47 â\\\\x80\\\\x9cprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics , potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability. \\\\nThe Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile , is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Hereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cDonna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nThe article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIâ\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled â\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nMartin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now , as well as a CNN contributor. \\\\nIn another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following , while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureauâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nSome critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe . This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons. \\\\nThe alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates â\\\\x80\\\\x98objectedâ\\\\x80\\\\x99 to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week â\\\\x80\\\\x93 something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case. \\\\nAccording to a report filed by Zero Hedge , a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik , the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin , Clintionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s closest aide. \\\\nInterestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , over his alleged foreign business connections. \\\\nBack in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news : \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafortâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtashâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say. \\\\nThat same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\nAlthough the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia â\\\\x80\\\\x93 so far, thereâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time. \\\\nWatch this space â\\\\x80\\\\x93 as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown. \\\\nMore from LifeZette belowâ\\\\x80¦ \\\\nâ\\\\x80\\\\x98OUT OF CONTROL?â\\\\x80\\\\x99â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Wikileaks reveals Robby Mookâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s links to DNC contractor who discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence.

The officers were responding to reports that a man was sleeping on the steps of Merdie\\'s Tavern, unaware they were talking to Ahmad Rahimi. Rahimi is alleged to have injured 31 people when he detonated two bombs in New York and New Jersey last month. Moments after the conversation began Rahimi opened fire at Linden Police officer Peter Hammer and four other officers who had been called as backup. No one was killed in the shoot-out which followed, but everyone was injured, including Rahimi.

It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterdayâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. Â· Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hallâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. Â· Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. Â· The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Unionâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Willis Ward Lounge. It will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Â· Our Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs is offering an open space of support to help members of our community connect during open hours today. MESAâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s office is in the Michigan Union, Room 2202. Â· Tomorrow, our Ginsberg Center and Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a Post-election Dialogue: Impact, Perspective-taking, and Moving Forward. This event is part of the Student Life Professional Development Conference at 1 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 2 p.m. in the Michigan Leagueâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Henderson Room. I know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. I thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the University of Michigan Events Calendar. I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people. Elections are often times of great change, but the values we stand for at U-M have been shaped over the course of nearly 200 years. Our mission remains as essential for society as ever: â\\\\x80\\\\x9câ\\\\x80¦to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d I look forward to working together with all of you to advance the work we do in service of the public â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and to ensure that the University of Michigan will always be a welcoming place for all members of society.

Mohammad Ballout, from Assafir Lebanese Daily , reported that some Egyptian military formations have recently arrived to Syria, signaling an end to the time where Egypt simply stood by, hands crossed, looking at the goings-on in Syria. \\\\nIt seems that the Egyptians have sent 18 helicopter pilots to the Hamah Airbase, and it is hoped that they will see action in joint Egyptian-Syrian operations. \\\\nFour senior Egyptian military figures also joined the unit when it first came to Syria, and two Major Generals have been operating at the Armed Forces Staff Headquarters in Damascus, near the operations room. The two Major Generals have been touring the fronts since they arrived a month ago, and have been reviewing the efforts made at the fronts, most recently the Southern Front at Quneitra. \\\\nThese new developments are apparently the result of intensive, unannounced, high profile security meetings that began over a year ago between Cairo and Damascus. Arab sources also expect that these developments will go beyond these symbolic operations, and will see Egyptian task forces operating on a large scale in support of the Syrian army. \\\\nMoreover, a senior Syrian security official also said that the Egyptians have promised to send forces to Syria, and have schedule post-December 23rd as the Zero-Hour, whereupon Egyptian participation in Syria will escalate. Another official also revealed that after December, a large number of Egyptian forces will also participate in the Syrian operations, and their participation will not be limited to Aerial support.
